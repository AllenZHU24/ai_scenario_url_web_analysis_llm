"oem" means original equipment manufacturer, and it is a term used to describe parts that are built by the company that made your equipment. often interchangeable online with terms like "official", "certified", "manufacturer-made", and "genuine", oem means your parts are the real deal. why buy oem? compatibility oem parts are built to last. when you buy manufacturer-grade parts you’ll get a longer life out of them, and your gear, than if you purchased aftermarket. manufacturers are constantly updating and improving their technology and parts, too, so the oem part you buy to replace your defective one is likely to be even higher quality than the original. you’ve invested in quality tools and equipment that often have to stand up to tough working conditions, and the parts to repair them should be no different. quality oem parts are built to fit your specific equipment. as long as you’ve accurately located the part that needs to be replaced, you can guarantee that with an oem part, it will be compatible with your gear and be a perfect fit. generic and aftermarket parts are often universal in nature and may not perfectly match your model in a variety of ways. view all brands how to find my oem parts?

can i get after-market parts on ereplacementparts? ereplacementparts does not offer after-market parts, because we cannot stand behind their quality, longevity, and compatibility with your equipment. look for words like "third party", "universal", and "refurbished" when browsing online; these terms are often used to describe after-market parts that are lower quality and will not last. you will never find these terms on ereplacementparts, as we are committed to excellent oem parts that stand the test of time. but i can save money buying after-market parts, can't i? the price tag on after-market parts is generally significantly lower, and that should raise alarm bells rather than savings excitement. the lower-quality materials that these parts are made with, and their universal designs and cheap manufacturing are how they can be priced lower. buying these parts can cause damage to your equipment, cause electrical fires and other issues after installation, and may void manufacturer guarantees and warranties if used. plus, most of the time, they just will not be able to survive the rough environments your equipment like power tools and lawn gear are subjected to. while the up-front cost may be cheaper for after-market parts, we believe strongly in saving our customers from further repairs, safety issues, and complete gear replacement in the long run. preferred partner program ereplacementparts is proud to be the preferred partner of dozens of leading equipment brands that build the gear you love. that means our inventory and availability are unmatched, and in some cases, we are the exclusive parts providers for these brands for their oem parts programs. our list of preferred partners is constantly expanding as we prove our dedication to working with manufacturers to provide you with high-quality parts. vanguard - briggs & stratton weber wilton worx bionaire black and decker bosch breville briggs & stratton broan campbell hausfeld char-broil chicago pneumatic coleman crock-pot cuisinart devilbiss dewalt ego exmark fein husqvarna industrial air ingersoll rand jet karcher kawasaki margaritaville metabo metabo hpt (hitachi) milwaukee mk diamond mr. coffee mtd nutone oster porter cable powermate-pramac powermatic senco simplicity skil snapper stanley tanaka vanguard - briggs & stratton weber wilton worx bionaire black and decker bosch breville briggs & stratton broan thank you! × your email, , has been added to our mailing list. error × we were unable to add your email to our mailing list. millions of partsfrom top brands need help?
