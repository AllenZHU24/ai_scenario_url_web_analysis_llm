string trimmer and both options do the job. i have had this product for at least 10 years and it has been very reliable. it has always started on 1-3 pulls and runs well. just this past month i have had an engine problem where it bogs down under a load. i found out there is no repair for this product locally and am now trying to determine what the problem is. i am very happy with the product but if the repair costs are close to the price of a new one i will be forced to look at new products that are available. ryobi ry10532posted by: adam10/19/2009i have a model ry10352 chain saw. i have around 30 hours run time on this unit. the saw runs good has plenty of power with a 18 inch bar. it is fairly easy to start and stays running. my only grip is the oil pump drive gear failing at such low hours. this is the first saw i have ever had the oil pump fail on actually. it would be nice if i could purchase the nylon drive gear without having to buy a complete oil pump assembly. black and decker cst1000posted by: john esparza10/19/2009it is by far the best cordless trimmer that i have ever owned. i sometimes even did my whole lawn with it. it is a homeowner's dream to own one of these bad boys. but now i lost my charger number 371415-04 model number cst1000 type 4. i hope to get me a charger so i can have my jobs around the house done and make my wife happy again, thanks john esparza bosch b9150posted by: ampsanat10/13/2009i have two of these 4.5" angle grinders that i use in a welding shop for grinding, cleaning rust, removing slag, cut-off and anything else. they are simply the best. they get abused and they keep running like they were new. i want to buy two more just because they are so good, but i find they are obsolete, so i will try to find some used ones. black and decker bv1500posted by: roberta10/11/2009i love the idea of this device. it helps with picking up leaves and pine shells that the squirrles leave behind. what is weak, the shoulder bags. the zipper part always blows out. pretty soon you have not only chopped up debris all over the place but the dust gets in your nose and eyes. you also have to wear ear muffs because of the sound. but when it works, it is great... i just have to keep buying bags which gets pretty costly. black and decker parts black and decker electric drill parts black and decker sander parts black and decker jigsaw
