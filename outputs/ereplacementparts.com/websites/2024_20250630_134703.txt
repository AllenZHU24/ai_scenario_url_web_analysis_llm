in our warehouses, but with so many power tool parts available, we are simply unable to stock every part for every product. our website shows real-time inventory statuses for every part that we normally have "in-stock." our website also shows which items must be special ordered from their manufacturers before we can ship them from our warehouse. our policies for regular special order items, backordered items, and discontinued items are explained below in this section. regular special order items in order to provide customers with full access to every part available on the market, we will special order non-inventory parts for customers directly from the part manufacturers. most special order items must first arrive at our warehouse before we can ship them to customers. because of this, special order items have lead times. we estimate that most special order parts will arrive at and leave our warehouse within 1-2 weeks from the date of order placement. although, the average extra wait time for a special order parts tends to only be about a week. there are no extra charges for regular special order items. back ordered items although infrequent, manufacturers sometimes run out of an item entirely. an item is considered on back order if we don't have it in our warehouse, and if the manufacturer has also sold out of the item. if an item has sold out from the manufacturer, the most we can do is wait for the item's back ordered status to change and keep our customers informed of the situation. in many cases, it can take weeks or even months for manufacturers to release a backordered item. we make every effort to notify customers of backorders at the time of sale. however, parts can go on backorder without the manufacturer first notifying us, making it possible for customers to purchase back-ordered parts. we notify customers by phone as soon as we discover that a back-ordered item has been purchased. customers can then decide whether or not to keep the order open as-is, or to remove the back-ordered item from the order. if an order for a back-ordered item is kept open, the back-ordered item will be shipped to the customer as soon as it arrives at our warehouse. discontinued / obsolete parts machines and equipment have limited support lives, so a manufacturer may decide to discontinue some or all of the replacement parts for a product after a few years. discontinued parts are not orderable on our site. we indicate discontinued parts on our website with a yellow highlighted line in our parts listings. we are simply unable to sell discontinued parts to our customers, because they are similarly unavailable to us from the manufacturer as well. manufacturers can discontinue a part without notice, so it's possible for a discontinued part to be mistakenly ordered if the manufacturer fails to first notify us. if a customer orders a part that has been discontinued without our prior knowledge, we will contact the customer as soon as we are made aware of the part discontinuation and make arrangements for a full refund. shipping information order lead times in-stock orders will ship from our warehouse within one business day of placing your order. this includes orders with several parts in them, as long as all of the parts are in stock when they are ordered. orders with one or more "special order" parts must be specially ordered and have a longer lead time. this lead time is necessary to acquire parts from the manufacturer. please note that these lead times indicate the estimated time until your shipment is expected to leave our facility, not the final delivery date. after shipping from our warehouse, packages will follow the package transit times schedule listed in this section. also, please note that we do not ship packages on weekends or on major holidays. the estimated lead times count regular business days only. package transit times once an order is shipped from our warehouse, the package will follow the transit time as described below. this transit schedule is an estimate only, except where otherwise noted. transit times start on the first full day after shipment. packages do not move on weekends. economy economy shipping is our least expensive shipping option. depending on your location, packages usually arrive anywhere from 2-8 business days, however this is not guaranteed and they may take longer.** note: when you place your order, the shipping estimates will display accurate delivery timeframes for your address. ground ground shipping is inexpensive, fairly fast, and extremely reliable - delivery within the quoted transit time period is guaranteed.* tracking is available for all ground shipments, and a tracking number is automatically emailed to customers upon shipment from our warehouse. expedited expedited shipping is generally fast and inexpensive. it typically provides nationwide 2-4 day delivery service nationwide, including alaska and hawaii.** next business day next business day

orders have only a window of time when the order can be modified before shipment. if an order is waiting on special order items to arrive, customers can modify the order by adding or deleting as many items as they like. we do not charge a fee for modifying an order before the order is shipped. if items are added to an order during this waiting period, we will adjust the total on the credit card charge to include the cost of the additional parts and any additional shipping when possible, however, we do not save your credit card information so we may ask you for your information if you make changes. if items are deleted from an order during this waiting period, we will refund the price of the parts on the credit card. once an order has shipped we cannot modify the order. after an order is shipped, any returns or exchanges are handled according to our return policy. please contact us if you wish to make changes to your order. orders for in-stock items ship within one business day. customers can also make changes to in-stock orders, but the changes must be made quickly before the order ships. if you need to modify your order, it's fastest to call us. canceling orders orders can be canceled before they are shipped. canceled orders are refunded in full, regardless of what was ordered. the purchase amount of the order will be returned to the ordering credit card. we recommend that you call us during business hours to cancel your order, but if you prefer, you may email us to cancel as well. because we are unable to cancel or recall orders that have already been shipped, returning shipped orders must be handled according to our return policy. social media ereplacementsparts.com wants to promote a friendly and positive social media experience for our community members.
