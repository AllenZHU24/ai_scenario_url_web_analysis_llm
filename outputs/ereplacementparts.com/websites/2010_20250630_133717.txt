this is the finest saw i have ever used.....this particular model is no longer made so if you find one, buy it. parts are still readily available. devilbiss xr2500 reviewed by: tom on 12/26/2010 one of the faults of this washer is the pump, which has two straps that are on the top and bottom and move the pistons. fatigue makes these weak over a couple of years of occasional use; and when one breaks, it can easily break one of the pistons. they appear to be ceramic, and break easily to shearing pressures caused by one strap breaking. from my 'net research, this is fairly common. i ordered straps (both) and a piston back in early september, and it is now december 26th. i received the two straps fast, but the piston has been backordered since i placed the order. i would recommend a different pump if you can't afford to wait for parts. makita n1900b reviewed by: kevin ouimet on 12/24/2010 i've owned and my staff and i have used this tool planer for five years non stop and this my first call for a part replacement and all that is required is the trigger switch, and that's because i foolishly rested it on a step ladder and the ladder got kicked out which caused the tool to drop to a concrete floor and the switch's safety button fell off the the tool started right up again but wouldn't shut off without removal of the plug so if you want to spend wisely makita the way. please work safely. delonghi ew7707cm reviewed by: tim a on 12/22/2010 i love our little heater; it heats our whole apartment--saves us a lot, but it needs a gasket and you can't find the gaskets for it. we purchased a new one and it is not what our old one is. the older one is twice as good the new one; it will not heat the whole place and is too much for the bedroom at night on lowest setting. so we are looking at finding new gaskets to fix the older one it had been leaking, so we are adding oil to it. i need to know what it uses and how full to fill it. any one know out there? makita 2030 reviewed by: ken on 12/21/2010 i bought a makita model 2030 new in 1982, for use in my home shop. i generally use it only during the winter months, for non-commercial mostly hardwood projects. the long table on the jointer was the main reason for buying this model. no repairs have been required. i do need to refurbish or replace the planer drive rollers now, and realign the jointer infeed table. i could not have made a better purchase. shopping cart 0 items information faq shipping information privacy noticereturn policyabout us contact us linksrepair blogadd multiple partstool repair forum customer service contact us location and hours corporate customer website information about us privacy policy website security info payment options return policy shipping information order lead times package transit times international shipping special order items get connected follow us on twitter join us on facebook community forums see us on youtube on your iphone online payments need help? call toll free 866-802-6383 8:30-5:00 m-f mountain time ereplacementparts.com 564 w 9320 s sandy, ut 84070 copyright © 2010 ereplacementparts.com inc.
