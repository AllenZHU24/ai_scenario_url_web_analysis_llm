this process, contact your credit card company and let them know that you would like to add an alternate or authorized address. if your credit card company does not allow this, have them list the address in your account notes or memo area. this will help avoid unnecessary delays in processing your order. will there be any delays to my purchase? although rare, all orders are subject to a 24-hour delay to verify billing information with the credit card issuer. this hold may be necessary to protect you from credit card fraud and identity theft. due to additional processing time,
