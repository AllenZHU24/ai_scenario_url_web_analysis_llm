on sale price cut items with free gifts items with rebates best sellers used gear restocks top rated the drum kit as we know it today is truly a 20th century invention, with the first bass drum pedal being patented in 1909. these days there is no "standard" kit, though the 5 piece configuration, with a kick, snare & three toms is the most popular configuration currently available from the manufacturers. what's great about musician's friend is that we don't just sell standard kits. if you want multiple snare drums in a variety of depths and materials, we have almost 250 to choose from. we have literally thousands of cymbals and drum accessories, to choose from – all of which are designed to help you find the signature sound that's unique to you. electronic musicians in need of a beat are well catered to, as we have a great selection of electronic drums, and software-based virtual drums & percussion. all drums and percussion gear come with our 45-day lowest price and total satisfaction guarantees and free standard shipping now applies to all orders over $25, including many heavy items, so build the kit of your dreams today! drums & percussion(5976) all results 1 - 20
