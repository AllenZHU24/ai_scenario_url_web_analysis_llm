even with the same electric guitar, no two players sound exactly alike. every nuance of the player's hands comes out in the electric guitar's tone, both in fretting and plucking the strings. the best players master not only command of the electric guitar, but also its interaction with their effects and amplifier. it's difficult to imagine a world without the combination of the electric guitar and amplifier, yet it's still relatively new in music. by the turn of the twentieth century, it only made sense that the popularity of the guitar would soon be combined with the onset of electronics. over the past 75 years, the electric guitar has established itself as one of the most iconic, unforgettable instruments in the world. from jazz and big band to rock 'n' roll and funk, popular music would be drastically different today had it not been for the electric guitar. by the 1950's, brands like gibson and fender were gaining notoriety thanks to the popularity of rock 'n' roll and its stars weilding electric guitars. guitarists like dick dale, bo diddley, chuck berry and chet atkins could all be found carving their own places in music history with the electric guitar, and by the early 60's the instrument saw an extraordinary upsurge in popularity. today, there are an endless amount of rock sub-genres, making no shortage of superbly crafted electric guitars from the world biggest brands, including ibanez, epiphone, and danelectro, as well as godin, gretsch, peavey and more. whether you're into black metal or folk rock, you can be sure that there's an electric guitar that perfectly matches your own style and tastes, and it can easily be found right here, regardless of your skill level or budget. if you're looking for one of the best strats fender has to offer, be sure to check out the fender american professional stratocaster. developed with pickup master tim shaw, its brand-new v-mod single-coil pickups are voiced specifically for each position, mixing alnico magnet types to produce powerful, nuanced tones with original fender sonic dna. for metal guitarists, have a look at the jackson js32 dka electric guitar. swift, mean, and easy to play, this guitar offers classic jackson tone and playability at a more than affordable price. if you're looking for a les paul guitar, a great choice is the epiphone les paul custom pro electric guitar. if you're ready to step up to a gibson les paul, the 2019 gibson electric guitar lineup is in-stock. what is the perfect electric guitar for you? for many experienced players, that answer changes with the song and their mood. if you're unsure where to start, find inspiration in your favorite music. even the greatest guitar players of all time have idols and influences. as you progress as a player, you'll find a style and tone that's all your own. {"evar4":"shop: guitars","evar5":"shop: guitars: electric guitars","pagename":"[mf] shop: guitars: electric
