added the portable mg2fx to its popular mg4 line of guitar amps. it offers a user-friendly interface consisting of four dual-function knobs (augmented by a tap/shift button and a single-character led display) to provide instant access to ten distinct gain stage settings, five digital effects, a two-band eq, and a tuner. for the ultimate in mobility, the mg2fx can run on battery power (via six "c" cells), and also includes an ac adapter for use in the home or any place power is available. the gain and volume knobs—along with the ten-position mode knob—provide popular tone flavors, including a shimmering clean tone, the famous marshall "crunch," and all the overdrive needed for an over-the-top lead. the treble and bass knobs offer further tone tweaking. digital reverb and delay are built-in, with an intuitive "tap" button for setting the delay time (holding down the tap/shift button also activates the onboard tuner). in addition, a chorus, phasing or flanging effect can provide extra downstream sparkle to the sound. the mg2fx also includes an mp3/line input for jamming along to any audio source. the headphone output allows for private practice, and also serves as a line output for recording or for connection to a larger sound system. the 6-1/2" speaker is powered with two marshall-sized watts for true rock sound. features 2 watt outputspeaker 1 x 6-1/2"channels: 10

customer reviews... great gigging amp - mg2fx 2w guitar combo amp | review by: richard sadeck | 4 days, 5 hours ago 1 people out of 1 found this review helpful features:kind of over the top happy with this amplifier.   i use it live on stage!!!   read the manual it has all the basics of the new breed of modeling amplifiers....different gain stages and multiple digital effects.quality:seems okay, we'll see how it holds up gigging!value:i bought 2 of them on sale!!  i should have bought 6!!!overall:i play in a 3 piece rock, blues, southern rock, band.  due to inury,  i have downsized my stage gear and have resorted to using very small amplifiers mic'd or run direct via behringer ultrag di (amazing little creature).  with a morely aby switch,  i set one amp clean and the other on crunch 1 with the gain maxed out.  i use sm57s on both of them with a carpet barrier around them to stop the bleed through.  when i don't mic them, i use the headphone out to the di with the 4x12 setting, then to the board.  i have also run them directly from the headphone out to the board.....no problems whatsoever. many of you readers will think i am crazy.......  one thing i have learned over the years is that the pristine tone you get at home with all the vintage and boutique amplifiers (i have them all.... fender, supro, ampeg amp from the 60s when i started playing  and lousy boogies) is lost on stage in a live setting........at least at the clubs i play at these days.....too cramped, ceilings low etc etc etc.  i used the good stuff for recording and now i gig with these little marshalls and roland cube xl amps.  seriously!   i gig these two little amps and everyone that is a musician comes over to me between sets and wants to know what my rig is.  i show them and they don't believe it.  keep in mind that classic rock and southern rock doesn't use high gain.  that maybe why this works so well...think hendrix, srv, trower, johnny winter etc.  take care and try it for yourself.do you

people out of 0 found this review helpful features:for a mini amp, the mg2fx has a very full array of features.  10 different amp tones from clean to full out high gain overdrive.  you get separate reverb and delay and 3 modulation effects.  unlike other mini amps, you also get full gain,bass and treble controls, not just a worthless "tone" pot.  the midrange is largely controlled through the various amp models.  you can easily adjust the treble and bass using the dual function controls and that makes a big difference in the tones.  tweaking the presets gets you some really rockin' tones.  all the other features are there: battery power or included (excellent quality) dc power supply, mp3 input, headphones out and a tuner that displays the string name.  the marshall has the largest speaker of the mini-amps, at 6 1/2 inches and a loud 2 watts of power.quality:excellent quality for this amp.  the cabinet is solid and carefully covered.  all corners have full sized protectors.  the controls feel smooth and secure and all the jacks are solid.  in this market for small amps, it's as good or better than any other mini amp i've seen or used.value:at the super price mf had these amps, this is a steal.  absolutely the best price for one of the best mini amps out there.  full feature array, great mini-amp tones and solidly built.  wow!overall:the mg2fx is a great little amp.  it does what these amps should do, and does it better than almost any other little battery amp out there.  the 10 amp models are great, true marshall tones from clean to crunch to shred.  you can adjust the tones on the presets and get some really happening sounds.  the effects are very nice as well.  all these mini-amps have a bit of a mid-range hump on their tones dues to the small cab and speaker size but compared to even some of the mini-tube amps, this one sounds excellent.  i enjoy using this for practicing.  i can crank it, get some good sounds, jam along with my mp3 and not bring the walls of my house down or neighbors complaining about the volume.  do you own the product?:yeshave you used the product?:yesmusical experience:semi-prostyle of music you play:classic rock,

features:it has 10 different overdrive settings, fx, and a built in tuner. for an amp at this price you can't beat it.  quality: i just got and have only played through it a couple of times, but so far it's flawless and sounds great.value: with the features it has combines with the sound quality and the fact it will get pretty loud for such a small amp, i couldn't be happier.overall: i won't list all the fx, but i will say you can use the delay, reverb and one other effect all at the same time. it's a small amp, so it's not supposed to sound like a stack. for a small practice amp this thing is a great amp. it has effects, a built in tuner, which is awesome, 10 different levels of overdrive, and has great tone. the size makes it extremely portable and it has a headphone out jack so you can practice even when everyone else is sleeping, or watching tv, without disturbing anyone. do you own the product?:yeshave you used the product?:yesmusical experience:semi prostyle of music you

helpful features:where this amp excells is in the headphones. the speaker isn't quite big enough for a beefy marshall sound but if you enter the metal zone with a good set of headphones (i am using sennheisers), back off a little on the gain and add a little chorus you wil be in rock-n-roll heaven! it's a lot of fun without headphones also but better with them.quality:don't use it as a volleyball and you should get many years of use out of it.value:one of the best mini monsters i have ever played through!overall:don't think...just play (after you buy this little joy toy).do you own
