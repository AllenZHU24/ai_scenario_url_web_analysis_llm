of musical instruments. synonymous with popular music, over the years, fender has crafted many well-known instruments that have become known as the pinnacle by hobbyists, professionals, and collectors alike. founded in 1946 by leo fender, fender brought the first mass-produced solid-body spanish-style electric guitar to the market, and with that, wrote the book on how to do an electric guitar right. today, their legendary telecaster and stratocaster designs are among the most respected and revered in the world. taking a look at the incredible wealth of talent that trust their sound to fender is sure to make your jaw drop. legends such as keith richards, jeff beck, eric clapton, randy bachman, stevie ray vaughn, dick dale, johnny marr and joe strummer all wrote some of their greatest hits on fender guitars, while modern masters like simon neil, tim armstrong, jimmy smith of foals, matt skiba of alkaline trio, and jim adkins of jimmy eat world strap in and rock out with these incredible instruments. newly released is the jimi hendrix signature stratocaster. featuring the reverse headstock and reverse pickup pattern, this guitar is highly collectable if you're a jimi fan. fender is known for producing an amazingly diverse lineup of instruments, so you'll definitely find one here that you're going to love. whether it's a strat, a tele, a mustang, jaguar or jazzmaster, these fenders are truly going to bring your playing to life. of course, fender also offers an impressive line of bass guitars as well as a full line of amplifiers, meaning they've got you covered regardless of which instrument you love. they say the more things change, the more they stay the same. and it's true, a lot has changed since fender first introduced their instruments to the world stage, but one thing has not, and that is their dedication and commitment to being the best in the world at what they do. fender's reputation has been built on forward thinking attitudes, diversity in their instruments, and unbeatable quality that keeps players coming back for an encore. choosing a fender instrument is, simply put, one of the best decisions any musician can make.
