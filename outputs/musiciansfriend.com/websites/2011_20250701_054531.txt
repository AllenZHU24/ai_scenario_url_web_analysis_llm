gimme a break...i use it and highly recommend it.for the money, it's hard to beat.do you own the product?:yeshave you used the product?:nomusical experience:semi-prostyle of music you play:folk, blueswhere you live:austin, txdid you find this review helpful? yes no798439 easy install, sounds great | review by: guitar player 99944 | 9 months, 6 days ago 5 people out of 5 found this review helpful features: quality: value: overall:took 2 minutes to install, no marks on my guitar. love this new plug!
