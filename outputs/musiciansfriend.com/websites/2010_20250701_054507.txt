recording gear software hands–on review: three–ring circuits electro-harmonix unveils a trio of new effects there seems to be a never–ending stream of new stompbox effects emanating from the circuit benders at electro–harmonix. twice a year the company's namm trade show booth trots out a fresh batch of signal–mangling machines calculated to excite electric guitarists, bassists, or anyone else who lives to alter audio signals in interesting and exotic ways. 2010 was no exception, with ehx proffering a bevy of new electronics that elicited headshaking and cries of, "they've done it again!" continue reading » hands-on review: tc-helicon voicetone create xt produced and polished vocal sounds in a stomp tc-helicon continues its innovative releases in vocal-processing technology. in addition to the flagship voicelive 2 and the stand-mounted voicelive touch is the create xt—a pedal that shares many of the best processing features that graced those high-end units into a compact format that fits neatly under foot. the create xt is not meant to replace the larger units because it doesn't harmonize, but for serving up quality vocals with professional polish and a producer-like sheen, the tc helicon create xt vocal effect pedal is perfect for gigs, rehearsals, and creative explorations into vocal processing. continue reading » hands-on review: spark studio microphone great sound plus focus control in a budget-priced condenser although still a relative newcomer in the microphone manufacturing arena, blue microphones has quickly established itself as a producer of quality microphones packaged in unique and strikingly stylish housings that make them unmistakably recognizable in studios and onstage. their bottle, baby bottle, kiwi, and dragonfly models have already gained acceptance among recording aficionados, and sit comfortably alongside classic models decades older and bearing revered german names. continue reading » hands-on review: squeeze boxes pigtronix offers two new radical takes on compression compression is probably the least sexy effect in the world of sonic manipulation, but remains one of the most important. by squashing down loud peaks and lifting quieter audio, it regulates the dynamic range of much of the music that you hear. whether it is used by producers to increase the impact of a track during mastering or by guitarists to tame picking transients and add sustain—compression is everywhere. always pushing the leading edge of analog effects technology, the folks at pigtronix have taken this ubiquitous sonic wallflower and turned it into the life of the party with two very cool new pedals. continue reading » product spotlight: yamaha piagerro 76-key digital pianos ultraportable digital pianos let you take your music on the road what's in a name? combining the words "piano" and "leggero"—italian for "light"—these new 76-key digital pianos emphasize portability, interactive features, and superior piano voice quality. the np-v80 and its younger sibling, the np-v60, are digital pianos that combine powerful functionality and an intuitive interface with a slim size and light weight. whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, the piaggero is a great instrument that won't crowd your living space or slow you down for those impromptu gigs-on-the-go. weighing just under 16 pounds, the name piaggero literally and physically translates into "light piano". continue reading » hands-on review: orange tt15 "tiny terror" lunchbox amp head it's little, it's loud, it's tubes … but it's more than that "lunchbox" guitar amps are all the rage, and why not? they're portable, can drive just about anything, and are great for recording. orange was one of the first companies to see the merits of the lunchbox approach, so the tiny terror is the result not just of what orange knows now, but what they've learned in the past. furthermore, it's a member of a family of products that includes the high-end tiny terror hard-wired edition, the two-channel dual terror, and two tiny terror combo amps with cabinet (versions with 10" and 12" speakers). continue reading » current deals learn to play essentials shop
