document folders are smaller in size for easy portability. custom printed document folders perfect for storing travel paperwork, tickets, or receipts, document folders are available in 12 different stocks. they are small enough to fit easily into a glove compartment or purse. some styles expand to 3/4-inch to hold additional promotional materials. one- and two-pocket options are available, as well as a four-pocket style to store smaller items such as gift cards, tickets, or hotel room keys. customize our document folders with four-color process, pms printing, or embossing imprint methods. or, choose from 24 colors of foil stamps. you can also select a style to match your design with portrait or landscape orientations. like our other presentation folders, business card slits are also available. popular uses for document folders include: travel documents transaction receipts banks & credit unions fine jewelers auto repair & tire shops insurance agencies orthodontists cosmetic surgeons promotional packets giveaways gift certificates document folder printing options imprint methods: choose from offset pms printing, foil stamping or embossing. pocket slits: optional business card slits. stock options: 12 paper stocks to choose from. foil stamp colors: 24 hues to choose from. customization tips & ideas document folder pricing includes a complimentary foil stamp or embossed area, up to 25 square inches. you can choose from 13 standard pms ink colors for your document folder. for an extra cost, you can choose any pms color of your liking. some document folders contain interior pockets for maximum storage capacity and additional design space. pockets come in both vertical and horizontal orientations. it is best to use simple designs for foil stamping, as intricate, small details make it difficult for the foil to stick to the stock. a tuck tab folder keeps your documents more secure by fastening shut the opening to the folder. interior flaps are perfect places to print checklists in order to minimize additional contents placed within folders. read less items 1 to 13 of 13 total page: 1 show 12243648 per page 4 1/2" x 10 1/4" wallet-style document folder 250
