are available with tabs, making them easier to locate among other documents. a vertical pocket allows you to take advantage of the document areas our eyes are naturally drawn to. the larger pocket size gives you more space for text or a detailed image. expansion folders have pockets that can expand up to 3/8", to help store larger documents. use rounded corners or reinforced edges to increase durability and help prevent "dog-earing" of your folder. aqueous coating gives folders general protection against natural wear-and-tear. it may be gloss (for a shiny appearance), matte (for the same protection but with less shine), satin (for a velvet-like texture and appearance), or soft-touch (for a suede-like texture). to further guard your folder against tears and stains, consider making use of laminate coating. ultraviolet (uv) coating creates a very shiny aesthetic but doesn't increase your folder's durability by very much. read less items 1 to 17 of 17 total page: 1 show 12243648 per
