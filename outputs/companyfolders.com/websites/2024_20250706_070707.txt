covers fold in half like a book and do not require binding. two-piece report covers are intended for large packets of information and must be bound to your documents. add a tab to your report cover so that it can be filed away in a cabinet and easily found when needed. die-cut windows show a preview of what's inside by displaying a portion of the first page of your report. pockets give you extra storage space for additional materials and are only available on two-piece report covers. some one-piece report covers are outfitted with guides that make it easier for you to bind your own information packets using staples. one-piece report covers are also available in a three-panel variety for additional design and copy space. choose a report cover with round corners to avoid the dog-earing of your documents. incorporate the unique shape of a vertical pocket into your design to create a genuinely unique cover. company about us our quality our blog reseller program contact us
