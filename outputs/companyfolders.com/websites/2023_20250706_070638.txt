a wealth of information in a portable, easy-to-read format. choose between four-page and three-panel brochures, then customize them with your own graphic designs. our brochures feature a bi-fold or tri-fold die-cut design, providing three distinct panels on which to display custom artwork or a company logo. they can easily be sent through the mail, displayed on retail racks or distributed by hand, giving you a plethora of options when it comes to supplying readers with printed information. most standard brochure templates feature a trifold design in portrait orientation that allow images to be revealed upon opening. these brochures often feature two panels, which are ideal for larger images and full bodies of text. our brochures use four-color process, making it easy to create rich designs that jump off the page, and can be finished with an ultraviolet coating for protection against wear and tear. print design tips for engaging brochures the amount of information and the distribution method you want to use will determine the size of your brochure. for example, a 3-panel brochure can fit inside a presentation folder's brochure slot or can be placed on a brochure rack, while a 4-page brochure is larger and provides more working space. ultraviolet (uv) coating gives your brochure a shiny, brightly colored effect while providing some protection against wear and tear.

a captivating headline on the front cover. balance the usage of text and images so your brochure design is not overly reliant on one or the other. a reasonable image to text ratio will provide a pleasant experience for recipients. four-page brochures fold in half and measure in at 8 1/2" x 11" when folded and 11" x 17" when unfolded. 3-panel brochures fold into thirds and measure in at 3
