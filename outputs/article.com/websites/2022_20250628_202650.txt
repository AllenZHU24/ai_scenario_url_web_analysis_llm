between the end of the first estimated delivery window and the second estimated delivery window,â  we will split the deliveries for free. in all other cases, separate shipping fees will be charged if you choose to have separate deliveries. please note that if you live outside of our standard shipping area, additional shipping charges may apply.â we may choose to split smaller items which will be

of stock and has no eta, you can sign up to be notified when it becomes available again. if an item has a â€śback in stock in x weeksâ€ť message on the product page, youâ€™ll still be provided with an

the manufacturer to our warehouse. order holds if youâ€™d like to receive your order at a later date than in the estimated delivery window, you can add delivery instructions at checkout or reach out to our care team. please include the date youâ€™d like your delivery, and weâ€™ll place a temporary hold on your order. we can hold items for up to 30 days. delivery date requests while weâ€™re unable to guarantee a specific delivery date at the time you place your order, we will provide you with an eta window at checkout. you will be able to add delivery instructions noting your request for a delivery date thatâ€™s within the eta window or slightly after the eta window. the carrier will do their best to accommodate this if the item arrives at their facility in time. delivery appointment availability varies depending on the local delivery partner in your area. you will only be able to make an appointment once the order is at the local delivery partnerâ€™s facility, so we cannot guarantee a specific day at the time of placing your order. however, deliveries are generally made on weekdays between 9am and 5pm. the delivery partner in your area may be able to accommodate deliveries outside this time, so feel free to inquire when they contact you to arrange a delivery date. youâ€™ll receive updates along the way as your order is processed and shipped from our local warehouse. cancellations if youâ€™d like to cancel your order, simply log in to your my account page and click the â€?cancel orderâ€™ button beside the associated purchase. you will receive a confirmation email shortly after.â â if your order hasnâ€™t shipped yet, weâ€™ll issue a full refund. if it has shipped, a return shipping fee will apply to ship the item back to us. depending on your credit card provider, it may take up to 10 business days for your refund to be reflected on your balance haul-away services we currently donâ€™t offer haul-away services for old or used furniture.
