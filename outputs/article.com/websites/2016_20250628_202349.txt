” ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ julia c. from halifax, ns bought a timber pebble gray sofa “i am so pleased with this purchase. it felt like a risk to buy a sofa without sitting on it, but i scoured the reviews and decided to go for it based on the price, the materials, and to get the mid century modern style we wanted. the sofa arrived earlier than expected, was well packed and no issues with delivery. one tip - the sofa depth and seat height were the same as our old one, (which is what i based the 'comfort factor' on) but the seat is deep. i am 5'4 and if i am sitting flat against the cushions my feet dont touch the floor. it's ok if i put an occasional cushion behind my back, but it may bother someone shorter. i would buy from article again. no hesitations with recommending this sofa. ” ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ cristina p. from milwaukee, wi bought a ceni pyrite gray sofa “this is an amazing sofa!
