it’s simple. first, you have to increase your leads. now, you could increase your leads by working a lot harder. you could write more blogs, put out more newsletters, speak at more events, do more social networking, and generate reams of additional content in the hopes of attracting more customers to your products. you could increase your leads by spending a lot of money–on advertising, promotions, and other marketing opportunities. or you could increase your leads the smart way… by getting other people to do the work for you. that’s what clickbank is all about.  as a clickbank vendor, you’ll have access to an affiliate sales force that’s tens of thousands strong. you’ll be able to reach literally millions of customers in more than 190 different countries. you’ll receive detailed sales reports with all of the pertinent customer data, so that you’ll be able to re-market to your customers with the back-end products you already have. and you’ll receive your checks on time, every time–the way clickbank has been operating for more than a decade. it's all about "filling the funnel" the trick for every information product business is to bring in the best possible leads at the lowest possible cost. after all, the more you’re filling your funnel with people who are interested in your front-end products, the more robust your back-end business will be. to fill your funnel, you’re probably already tapping into a slew of lead generation channels to pitch your front-end products… your own websites, your blogs, advertising, affiliates… maybe even with e-books through the kindle or ibook stores. if you’re using these channels right, many of them aren’t just working well for you—they’re self-liquidating for you. in the quest for bringing in the best possible leads at the lowest possible cost, nothing beats filling your funnel with leads that are paying for the privilege! not only might you be making a bit of money on your lead-gen efforts—but you’re bringing in leads that have already shown a propensity to pay for the knowledge you have to share.  these customers will likely be even more willing to step-up to your back-end products. but despite all of the lead generation mechanisms you may be using, are you really leveraging every channel out there? are your ads reaching all of the right eyeballs?  are your affiliates extensive enough to search out prospects in all of the online nooks and crannies? is every possible lead that fits your niche hearing about you and your front-end products? don't miss out on lead generation opportunities if you’re not using clickbank as a channel today, it’s very likely that you’re missing some potential customers. for well over a decade, clickbank has been the go-to distribution channel for thousands of infopreneurs looking to grow their customer base with front-end product sales. as a clickbank vendor, you get access to a worldwide pay-for-performance sales team—potentially thousands of people with access to an audience that could fit your niche. we’ve been helping infopreneurs distribute their products to customers since 1998. in all that time, we’ve never missed a payment to our vendors or affiliates. we’ve built our company by finding the very best ways to connect high-quality information vendors with highly motivated customers. and our tools and processes for connecting buyers and sellers are some of the best in the business. why not see what clickbank can do for you? it only takes a few minutes to get started if you’re an established infopreneur, adding clickbank as a channel is a no-brainer.  it complements your other lead generation channels (even if you’re already using your own affiliates), and you’ve likely already done much of the hard work! you’ve figured out which hot-buttons to hit with front-end products … you’ve figured out the front-end product pitch that converts the best… you’ve already developed the front-end products themselves… clickbank provides you with a platform to sell your products, handle the transactions (in over 30 currencies), and deliver the products to your customers.  and you’ll have full access to the consumer after clickbank’s sale of your product. like any affiliate sale, you incentivize clickbank’s pay-for-performance sales team by offering a percentage of the sales price of the product you created. they’re only paid once your product’s sold. and clickbank even takes care of that part for you… handling all of the reconciliation for you and depositing the profits back in your account. why wait?
