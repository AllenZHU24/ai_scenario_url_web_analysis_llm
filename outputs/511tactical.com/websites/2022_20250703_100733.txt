payment method used at the time of purchase. purchases made online at 511tactical.com may also be returned at a 5.11-owned retail location so long as you provide proof of purchase and have the

card. please allow five to ten business days from receipt of your returned item(s) for your refund to post. what items are eligible for returns and exchanges? please be sure to follow washing and
