joint, a method of securing your artwork in the frame, frame hangers and picture wire. frame sizes: due to the nature of our cutting equipment, the minimum frame length we cut is 6 inches. we will cut frames up to 96 inches. for artwork on stretched canvas or linen: measure the overall height and width from the outside edges. you must include the size added by stretched canvas wrapped onto the edges of your stretcher bars. pay special attention to the canvas folded at the corners. make sure the profile you select is deep enough to fully cover the sides of the artwork. when entering
