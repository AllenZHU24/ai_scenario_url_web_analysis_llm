important information - educate yourself shipping times shown are the estimated number of days your order is in transit after your order has left our warehouse. this doesn't mean it is always the exact amount of time after the order is placed online. your order will be shipped once all of the items for your order have been gathered in our warehouse, and they are ready to ship. we have a revolutionary new "live inventory" display system on our site. in the product selection drop down menus on each product page, it combines the total amount of a certain item available in our warehouse, and all of our different supplier warehouses throughout the country. this will allow you to rest assured that the items you are ordering are not on backorder. all of the items on our site that appear to be "available" are either in stock here at our primary warehouse location, or in stock at one of our other distribution centers throughout the country. there are certain instances when we need to gather in items from our other distributor warehouses before we can ship your complete order. most items that need to be sourced from our other supply warehouses will take 1-3 days for us to receive. occasionally, it can take 4-5 business days. our sales staff will notify you when this is the case. once your order ships, you can track your order with ease. simply click on the "track your order" link at the top of our website. then you can login to your account and easily track the shipment. all international customers all orders will be shipped with an original invoice on the box, which shows the full amount that you paid for the products you have purchased. this will ensure that your package processes through customs with no delays. some countries have import tax laws, in which case you would be liable to pay import tax on the items you buy from us. please do your best to educate and familiarize yourself with these policies in your country. you may be responsible for paying these fees once you have received the package. ordering: currency converter my account order status shipping terms & conditions size charts returns form popular brands: fox alpinestars thor monster fmf pro
