cool designs for kids to choose from – because we know how important it is to establish your personality on the track. these jerseys are great for parents too because they let you actually identify and recognize your son or daughter while they’re out there on the track with all their gear on. most of our kids’ motocross jerseys have padding built into the elbow region, but elbow pads are also available as an additional layer of protection. elbow pads and guards come with varying levels of protection, the lowest level being a thin layer of additional padding and the highest level of protection being padding in addition to a hard plastic protective layer. we also have additional kids’ motocross gear and youth dirt bike gear designed for protection, including neck rolls, knee guards, support belts, chest protectors and shields for the ultimate protection. because when your rider takes a tumble or fall, additional protection could be the factor that keeps a day at the trail from ending in a ride to the hospital. we strive to keep our kids’ motocross gear and youth dirt bike gear quality high and prices low. if you ever have any questions, feel free to call us toll-free at 888-613-3393 (for international orders call 805-777-7601) or email us at info@btosports.com. ordering: currency converter my account order status shipping terms & conditions size charts returns
