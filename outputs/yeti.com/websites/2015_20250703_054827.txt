kittlitz domain wendigo.com this is ken kittlitz's domain, aka wendigo.com. i hold an msc. in computer science from the university of calgary, but am in constant danger of dropping it. my main claim to fame is the foresight exchange, a market in which the "stocks" are claims about future events. it's the direct successor of a site called idea futures, which was the web's first prediction market, opening in 1994. i and a partner, david perry, have recently formed a company called consensus point to educate companies as to how prediction markets can help them with decision support and risk management. i've worked at over half-a-dozen technology companies in my career thus far. one of the most successful was audesi technologies, a start-up that focused on java-enabled internet devices. we sold out to wind river systems right at the peak of the tech boom -- what timing! i then co-founded javien, a company that tried to create "web 2.0" years before that sad phrase became popular. we started right after the peak of the tech boom -- what timing! a few bumpy years ensued, but the company is still going, and i still help out sometimes. prior to audesi, i worked for kumo, a company that built non-trivial web sites and applications (well ok, some of them were trivial, but we didn't advertise that). we had a group of good people, and our goal was to have fun and get rich. we had fun. i've also worked for nortel, which isn't a bad company, as far as big companies go. as far as big companies go, i went. reviews somewhat dated now, but possibly still of interest: skeptic magazine the lucifer principle rogue primate other interests/accomplishments i'm a published author of horror fiction. i brew beer at home, and consume it everywhere else. i've played guitar in several alternative bands, all of which quickly achieved obscurity. i have very catholic (not catholic!) taste in music. visit my cd collection and let me know if you think i'm suffering from multiple personality disorder. i'm a casual treasure hunter, giving me lots of exercise and minimal return on investment. ken kittlitz (2015-11-17) mail sent to 'kittlitz' at this domain will likely find me..
