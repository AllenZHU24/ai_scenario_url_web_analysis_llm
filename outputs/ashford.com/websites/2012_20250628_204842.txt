12/20/2011 hi there, i recently ordered a skagen watch from you off amazon and i would just like to comment on how impressed i was with the shipment speed, packaging and special little touches that were totally unexpected. i expected that when i opened the box there would just be a little padding and my watch box sitting there. i was pleasantly surprised to see the reusable tote, cleaning cloth and all the extra wrapping and care that was taken. i ordered my own christmas present this year because of my husband's distaste for shopping and it made me feel really special to open up this nicely wrapped box and actually feel like it was a gift. if i am in need of another watch i will surely use you again. i will also recommend you to my friends and family.thank you again so muchj. 12/20/2011 that is why i shop with ashford, a+ service.j.f. 12/20/2011 larry,it was a pleasure to order the watch with your help and it is now a pleasure to own it!

07/15/2011 the original order was for a ebel watch. strap was too short. thanks to great assistance from larry ackerman (sales) and catia (service) and since ebel could not provide a larger strap, i was able to select a concord time piece which shipped the day after ashford received the returned timepiece. all took only 5 days. i will always purchase my timepieces through larry ackerman at asford sales ( just ask for him when you call. he is truly a expert on all his products and can answer all your questions. thanks again to larry and catia for their help. also,ashford paid for next day return and next day shipment of my concord, and as always the timepiece is beautiful. this is my 6th transaction with ashford through larry. tony(north carolina) 07/14/2011 i have never shopped here before. it was a great experience, easy and fast. 07/14/2011 everything i expected and more. a unbelievable value. great service and a great product. 07/13/2011 very impressed with how our purchase was shipped. it reflects the quality of the business and makes a strong statement of ashford. 07/12/2011 quick default shipping (delivered on 2nd business day). also liked the care and attention to detail that went into packing it; you could tell they take their business and the satisfaction of the customer seriously. the bulova marine star watch purchased exceeded expecations as well. thanks!
