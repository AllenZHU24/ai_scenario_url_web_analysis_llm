(we use a few fabrics made in japan) where the environmental protection agency has control over how they are produced. the views of mt. rainier and the olympic mountains from our seattle factory and headquarters enforce our commitment to our environment. riley is a handsome pup. what kind of dog is he? riley was adopted from the humane society, so we don't know exactly what kind of dog he is. our best guess is that he's an irish wolfhound with labrador. regardless, you're right — he is a handsome pup. and a nice person, too. in early 2007, riley gained a sibling in lily, a german shepherd/greyhound mix (technically called a lurcher). visit riley's page for more information on our dogs and cats, and friends of theirs. how do you pronounce 'bihn'? bihn rhymes with din. and fin. what does your care label say? it says "made in usa", "made in usa" in chinese, and "siquid mantica non capit, domi relinquendum est." (translation below) "siquid mantica non capit, domi relinquendum est."? translation: if it doesn't fit in your knapsack, leave it behind. why do you use a plane in your logo? tom's father was an airline pilot and tom was feeling a little sentimental when he was designing our logo. the artwork is based on a 1930s-era luggage label; it features a farman f-121 jabiru airplane. how's the weather up there? usually cold and rainy. next question please . . . buying our bags how can i buy tom bihn bags? you can order online through this web site or visit our seattle retail store. is your online checkout secure? yes, it is. we take the responsibility of keeping your data safe, whether it's your credit card information or your phone number, very seriously. scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on our geotrust security certificate verification to see our certification. and, as with any checkout on any web site, always look for the little lock or secure symbol in the corner of your browser window on any page asking for personal information. how can i be notified of new designs? we recommend signing up to our mailing list, reading our blog, subscribing to our blog's rss feed, visiting our forums, or a combination of the above to make sure you're updated on tom's latest designs, products that are in or out of stock, and other newsworthy items. are your bags available in stores? you can see the entire tom bihn line at our seattle factory showroom. for the address and hours of our seattle factory showroom, check out our contact and locations page. outside of the pacific northwest, the place to purchase tom bihn products is right here at www.tombihn.com. why are tom bihn bags so expensive? tom bihn bags are carefully constructed of fine quality materials and components in our own seattle factory. they'd be less expensive if we had them produced in china or vietnam, but then we'd lose control over the quality of the finished product and the quality of the jobs we create. our turn-around time (the time between designing a new product and being able to ship it to customers) is quite fast, especially for a small company. we could use cheaper materials, but we've been making bags for a long time and plan to make them for a lot longer still: we don't want folks complaining about this or that part breaking or wearing out prematurely. there are plenty of less expensive products on the market and it's up to you, the consumer, to decide if the quality of our products justifies their expense. why are tom bihn bags so cheap? so now that you know what goes into our products, you might wonder why they aren't even more expensive. first of all, we sell almost exclusively to the end consumer, so there is no wholesale-to-retail markup: you buy directly from the factory. second, we are a lean little company: we are not top-heavy with vice presidents, nor are we traded publicly. we are a museum-quality example of human-scale capitalism: we make stuff and sell it to people. do you offer a lifetime guarantee ? you bet. everything you buy from tom bihn is satisfaction guaranteed. defects in materials or workmanship are uncommon and almost always evident while the product is still new. if something goes wrong and it's our fault, we'll fix it for free. repairs due to normal wear and tear or due to other things that are not our fault will be done at a reasonable charge. keep in mind that daypacks, messenger bags, and briefcases are often subject to extreme wear in everyday use: do not expect them to last forever. only true love lasts forever! you can expect a tom bihn product to give years of hard service. note: tom bihn is not responsible for long lines at the supermarket, people who talk too loud on cell phones, or the fact that microbrewed beer is largely overrated. our warranty does not cover consequential damages. while tom bihn cases and bags give excellent protection to computers and other technology, we are not responsible for any damages or losses associated with the use of our products. this warranty is limited to the replacement costs only of tom bihn products. can i get a discount or a coupon? as we said above in the answer to "why are tom bihn bags so expensive?" a lot goes into our bags: u.s. made ballistic nylon and 500 and 1000 denier cordura®, ykk aquaguard® water-repellent zippers, japanese-made dyneema® ripstop fabric, etc. all of those components are turned into the bags you love in our seattle factory, sewn together by our amazing factory crew. yes, our bags are expensive, and no, we don't discount them. your tom bihn bag will last you many years, it will protect your laptop and other stuff from the elements, and it will be your constant, loyal companion. in short: we think tom bihn bags are worth it. do you accept purchase orders? yes. we accept purchase orders (pos) from governmental, educational, and medical institutions located in the united states, canada, new zealand, australia, ireland, and the united kingdom. we accept payment only in u.s. funds. you or your purchasing department must also fax a hard copy of the original purchase order to us at 206-621-8264 (u.s. and canada) or +1-206-621-8264 (other countries). my laptop isn't on your laptop bag fit guide. help! don't worry! help is only a quick email or phone call (1-800-729-9607 or +1-206-652-4123) away. send us the brand and model number of your laptop (and if you already have the dimensions of your laptop, send those, too!) and we'll let you know which of our bags would best fit your laptop. we'll also add your laptop to our laptop bag fit guide, so thanks for letting us know! i'm unhappy about something! what do i do? email us. call us (1-800-729-9607 or +1-206-652-4123). tell us what's wrong. we don't want you to have an unhappy experience. if you talk to us, we can probably make it better *and* make sure it doesn't happen again, or explain a misunderstanding. i'm really happy about something! what do i do? email us. call us (1-800-729-9607 or +1-206-652-4123). tell us why you're so happy. that will make us really happy, too! if you talk to us and let us know what we did that was right, we'll make sure we keep doing it. about our bags and designs do you offer custom-made bags? no. our seattle factory is dedicated to producing tom's designs. can i get a bag in a custom color combination? no. while our bags our made in our own little factory, it's still a factory: it just doesn't work for us to make one of anything. how often does tom design new bags? all of the time. tom is never without his sketchbook, and he regularly works on up to 10 designs at a time. tom always sews the first prototype of a new product himself. does tom make design updates to existing bags? throughout the year we may add a new pocket to an existing bag or add a new color. we are often able to give our customers a sneak preview of upcoming changes on our forums, so that's the best place to check on what we're up to. how often do you add new colors? it depends on the bag and the fabric used to make that bag. we're always looking for great new colors to add to our line, but if we add a new color, we're probably replacing a current color with it. feel free to post your color suggestions in our forums. will you be adding more "girly" colors? the definition of "girly colors" is highly subjective and debatable. not all women like pastel pink, and most women (at least the ones we know) don't like to be so easily categorized. (and let us not forget that pink-for-girls and blue-for-boys is a 20th century convention, not some ironclad law.) since this question was first asked, we've added 1000d cordura colors azalea (a bright magenta) and punch (an even brighter magenta that has since been retired). and plum, a rich purple more red than blue, has always been a tom bihn color. how can i make suggestions? we have so many ideas of our own that we hardly have time to make them all real! so, we don't accept product or design ideas or suggestions. if you think there's a way we can improve the customer service experience, please do email us. why don't you sell bags with wheels? wheels and the associated hardware and stiffeners add significant weight to a bag and are only useful on smooth surfaces. our product line is geared towards active folks who carry their own loads. not to offend those who use roll-aboards — it's just not part of our line. are tom bihn bags waterproof? all of the fabrics we use are "waterproof": coated with urethane inside and treated to have a water-repellent outside. we also use ykk aquaguard® water-repellent zippers on the exterior of bags or cover the zipper with a fabric flap to keep water out. however, seams can leak if exposed to significant weather. you can renew the water-repellent qualities of your bag with nikwax. be wary of other manufacturers claiming their products are "waterproof" just because the fabrics are coated. if the seams are not rf welded or heat sealed, they are probably not waterproof. where can i find reviews of tom bihn bags? check out the "reviews" link at the tops of product pages. and, we're working on a page that lists all reviews and evaluations of our products. we also recommend using a search engine to search the name of the bag you are interested in — you'll most likely find multiple reviews. we post links to new reviews of our bags on our blog. many customers also post reviews of their bags in our forums. cleaning, repairs, returns how do i clean my bag? we recommend hand-washing your tom bihn bag with a mild detergent — environmentally friendly dish soaps work well, but as always, with any soap, test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the bag before you use it on the entire bag. (palmolive® and dawn® soaps may be too harsh!) fill your sink or bathtub with warm water, add a little soap (a little goes a long way), and let the bag soak for a half hour. if there are visible spots of dirt, gently rub the area with a washcloth, or you can apply a little soap directly to that spot and let it soak. rinse your bag thoroughly (this is a lot easier if you've only used a little bit of soap) and lay your bag flat on top of a bath towel to dry. methods we don't recommend: having your bag dry-cleaned or putting your bag in a washing machine or dryer will void the guarantee and make your bag look funny. we don't want either of those things to happen. your tom bihn bag can last for years. the fabrics we use to make our bags are treated with a water-resistant coating, but over time, that coating will start to dissipate. if you live in a rainy climate like we do, we'd recommend treating your bag with nikwax after one year of use. something on my bag is broken. what do i do? email or call (1-800-729-9607 or +1-206-652-4123) us right away. our bags are designed and built to be tough. they're passed through an inspection process at each point during manufacturing. but if you think you've found a problem with your bag, we want to know so we can fix it. i ran over my bag with my car! can you repair it for me? we can usually repair your bag (tom bihn bags only, please) quickly for a very reasonable price. email or call us (1-800-729-9607) and we'll give you a quote. note: products which are returned for repair must be clean and free of dirt, sand, and strong odors. can you add a new feature or color to my bag? sadly, it is seldom cost-effective for us to add a new feature to an existing bag. and changing the color of a bag, well, that would be magic, wouldn't it? think of the purchase of a tom bihn bag as you would the purchase of a car: next year's model may have more features or come in a new color. but at some point you just need to take the plunge and get out there and enjoy your new bag! can i return my used bag for an exchange or refund? sorry: we do not accept returns of used bags. some other companies can afford to accept used products because the products cost so little to produce in the first place. our bags are made of the highest-quality materials in our own seattle factory, so they cost more to produce than bags made overseas (even if the prices of those bags made overseas are the same or higher than our prices!). additionally, we don't sell used bags. the only place to buy a tom bihn bag is through the tom bihn web site or in our seattle store, and that's your guarantee that the bag you buy from us is brand-new, unused, and free of any defects. how do i try out a bag without making it "used"? when you receive your tom bihn bag, you're welcome (and encouraged) to take it out of the box, inspect every inch of it, load it with what you carry in your current bag, and try it on for size, comfort, and looks. don't spill coffee on it, let your cat sleep on it, or let your puppy chew on it. it's similar to how you would test out a pair of shoes: try them on indoors to see how they feel, but don't wear them outside. trying out your bag in the way described above should give you a good sense of whether the bag is right for you. if you decide it's not right for you, you're welcome to send it back for a return or exchange. if you would like help deciding whether it's right for you, give us a call or send us an email. and if it's love at first use, congratulations! how do i return a bag?
