ask bob our ups driver: “how’s the holiday season busyness going so far for you?” or, ask him if it works better for him if we stack boxes “this way” versus “that way.” most folks will be pleasantly surprised by how you're paying attention." read more: our company philosophy the crew irma fabric cutting manager irma likes to take vacations. her favorite song is despacito by luis fonsi. kat customer service + shipping professional kat loves cats, musicals, zombies and most nerdy pursuits of happiness. tam binding/bartack professional + machine mechanic tam loves to watch soccer, travel, and listen to a wide variety of music. esther sewing/label placement/plant care professional esther is an avid reader. her favorite book is shogun: the life of tokugawa ieyasu by a.l. sadler. mike operations manager mike loves to cook and play outside as much as possible. hong shoulder strap specialist hong enjoys spending time with with her children and shares: "i recently bought a house - it's my american dream!" you yeah, you!
