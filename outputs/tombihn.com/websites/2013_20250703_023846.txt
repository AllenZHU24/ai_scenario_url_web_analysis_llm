"the aeronaut worked beautifully, looked smart and was a pleasure to carry with me both on the airplane, train from frankfurt to milan and walking through the city streets thanks to the great design, beautiful fabric and the amazing absolute shoulder strap. i also purchased tb packing cubes, organiser pouches and a travel tray that kept everything in its place both inside the bag and when unpacked in the hotel room. having everything in a cube — and not loose in the bag — makes a world of difference. just brilliant. and they fit into the aeronaut like hand-in-glove. in summary, this trip proved to me that you can travel light and still pack gear which looks good on the streets on milan, works for business meetings and after work at smart bars, restaurants... even nightclubs!" — posted by guyb in the forums - "aeronaut packing list for 2 weeks in europe" about us tom bihn has been designing and making bags since 1972. travel bags, laptop bags, and backpacks. the best materials and innovative construction. learn more about us. you + tom bihn bags see more of your photos on flickr. videos materials testing watch more of our videos. bag reviews "the short summary of this review is simple: this is the benchmark backpack on the market today." — everyday commentary's review of the synapse 25. read more bag reviews. featured blog posts recap of november's debuts the guide's pack, founder's briefcase, a new fabric... more.. two weeks in japan videos what chris and daniel packed for two weeks in japan. more.. girl's getaway packing list packing lists for 6 weekend getaways in 6 months. more.. 28+ organizer pouches in a variety of colors tom bihn about us contact us seattle store forums shipping rates faq my account track order wish list wish list search products travel bags laptop bags checkpoint friendly messenger bags backpacks briefcases knitting bags accessories dog stuff organizer pouches ipad bags more cool stuff videos blog twitter flickr facebook laptop bag fit guide weight, volume, & dimensions gift certificates 1-800-729-9607 / / skype "the bad days have two things in common: you know the right thing to do, and you let someone talk you out of doing it." —tom bihn subscribe to the newsletter unsubscribe © 2013 tom bihn. all rights reserved. sitemap | privacy policy
