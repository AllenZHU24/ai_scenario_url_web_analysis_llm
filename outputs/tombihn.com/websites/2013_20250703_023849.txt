"the design process is always evolving and varies from one bag to the next. the constant operating principal behind the process is this: i don't want to make something that is already out there. it has to be unique — work better, look better, last longer, fill a niche that no one else has filled. i keep in mind that, because our products last (almost) forever, i have a responsibility to make them be very useful and as handsome as possible as well: i personally don't like being around things that are not pleasing to the hand and eye, especially on a semipermanent basis. i feel in a small way like an architect." —tom bihn materials: u.s. made, 1050 denier, high tenacity ballistic nylon fabric. ykk aquaguard® water-repellent zippers. superstrong japanese dyneema®/nylon ripstop fabric. 500 and 1000 denier u.s. cordura® nylon. duraflex® and nexus buckles. double-plated, u.s. made metal snaphooks. when we can't find what we want, we design it and have it made — like our 250-lb-tested, acetal shoulder strap attachment rings, made for us in georgia (u.s.a.). we don't settle for less than the best: if there's a better fabric, a better zipper, a better anything out there, we'll find it. of course the best materials don't guarantee a great bag: we've been making bags for quite a while, all along paying close attention to which materials work in specific applications and which may look good today but are likely to fail down the road (or trail). construction: there's no finer team than our seattle factory crew. many of our seamstresses have been sewing backpacks and bags for over 30 years — in fact, we have over 300 collective years of sewing experience in our factory. tom works closely with the crew on refining the construction of his bags, relying on the crew to alert him to any details of the design or patterning that make cutting or sewing needlessly difficult or inefficient. tom, fong, lisa, and the rest of the crew work as a team, tweaking new designs and refining current designs, adding new machines, binders, tools, cutting saws, and other laborsaving technology to further streamline (and at the same time humanize) our manufacturing process. much of the minutiae involved in creating our über-durable bags is so deeply ingrained in us that we often forget to mention it: we finish 100% of the inside seams of our bags; we reinforce critical areas, like where a handle or strap joins the rest of the bag, with multiple bar tacks; all nylon webbing is hot knifed (heat fused) so it won't fray; and though you'll never see it, many crucial panels are overlock stitched prior to being included in the final construction. all to ensure your bag won't give up, ever! a variety of choices, lots of options we're a small company that behaves like we're a big company: we offer a rather large number of color options in many of our bags. and most of those colors are our own proprietary colors — colors you won't find anywhere else. plus, you can customize your tom bihn bag purchase by choosing which shoulder strap works best for you, which size insert best fits your laptop, which combination of packing cubes will best suit your travel style. finally, add zippered pouches and color-coded key straps to organize the interior of your tb bag. our materials: watch more of our videos. and see this interview in which tom discusses the tools that aide him in the design process. the aeronaut brain bag and aeronaut smart alec and brain bag medium café bag the photos above are by our customers. see more here. the crew candi: seamstress candi plays the piano beautifully. esther: seamstress esther is an avid reader. her favorite genres: mystery and romance. june johnson: vp of production june can save the life of any houseplant and is pretty much good at everything she does. tom bihn: designer and ceo tom's favorite book is young men and fire by norman maclean, and he plays the accordion. araceli: fabric inspector/spreader when she's not at work, araceli likes to sing, dance, and play the guitar. yuan: seamstress if yuan's not at work, she's probably playing tennis or doing karaoke. trevor: shipping czar trevor's most prized possession is his teenage mutant ninja turtles collection. nik: production engineer nik makes his own fermented sodas which can range from sweet and bubbly to explosively fizzy. coqueta: shipping department helper coqueta is an exceptionally good sniffer and digger and enjoys 5-year-aged ham bones. darcy gray: chief creative officer and vp most unusual hobby: hiking at night. edelmira: seamstress edelmira prefers mexican music above all others. aravelia: quality assurance velia's favorite movie is alice in wonderland. barb: hr/office manager/diva of details barb is one of those people that sees to every detail, forgets nothing, and makes it all look effortless. ichiro: ham ichiro is a happy and vocal lab/husky mix. he likes to be the center of attention and thus does not get free rein of the factory. irma: fabric cutter irma likes to take vacations (we miss her quite a bit) and listen to mexican music. kieu: seamstress kieu likes to go on urban walks. the secret to her good health? eating lots of vegetables from her own garden. lai-fong: sewing supervisor fong is a natural with dogs — and people, too!
