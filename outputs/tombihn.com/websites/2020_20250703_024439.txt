ask bob our ups driver: “how’s the holiday season busyness going so far for you?” or, ask him if it works better for him if we stack boxes “this way” versus “that way.” most folks will be pleasantly surprised by how you're paying attention." read more: our company philosophy the crew honguyen: sewing supervisor-in-training honguyen bakes amazing things. amongst her specialties: cupcakes. favorite song: "happy" by pharrell williams. wing: sewing professional wing's passion is music and healthy eating (lots of vegetables!) she loves living in the united states. lucy: assistant shipping lead lucy loves playing soccer, digging holes, and chasing her cat around the house. nik: coo, designer, programmer nik also loves playing soccer, digging holes, and chasing his cat around the house. matthew: documentation lead matthew loves games of all sorts. when he's not out exploring the city (and sometimes while he is) you can usually find him playing a game of some sort. ling feng: sewing/joining profesional likes to exercise to stay healthy. philosophy: we never stop learning. hong hai: sewing professional likes to cook. signature dish: bún riêu trung: sewing/binding professional likes to play soccer and is passionate about traveling -- especially to vietnam. tianying: zipper/floor professional loves to shop, especially shoes and kids stuff!
