even with usps's unreliable pick-up schedule, usps priority is likely to get to you as quick or quicker and cheaper than any other standard "ground" option. more questions? visit our f.a.q. or feel free to emailus@tombihn.com subscribe to our newsletter sign up for our newsletter! we send out news on design debuts and other interesting things. tom bihn about us blog philosophy bag specs customer service account faq guarantee returns shipping connect forums instagram email us the bihn guarantee. superior construction. thoughtful design. © 2025 terms & conditions accessibility © 2025 terms & conditions accessibility the bihn guarantee. superior construction. thoughtful design.
