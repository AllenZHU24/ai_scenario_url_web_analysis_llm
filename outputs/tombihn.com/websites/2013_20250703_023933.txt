just how much can you fit into one aeronaut? check out this packing list from i_clavdivs… “here’s my list: day bag clothing buff glasses cleaning cloth hoodies (wear 1, carry 1) jacket (wear) jocks & socks trousers (wear 1, carry 1) 4 t-shirts walking shoes (wear) cap/hat toiletries cotton buds deodorant lip balm medicine anadin toothbrush & toothpaste listerine strips edt gadgets headtorch monocular sunglasses book/magazine/kindle driving license ear plugs and eyemask headphones iphone money passport personal laptop & mouse camera chargers (camera, iphone, laptop, kindle) international adapter printouts car reservations flight reservations hotel reservations itinerary & directions route maps travel insurance” see the rest of the thread in the tom bihn forums.  see also: the aeronaut. tb crew | 6 january 2014 12:39 pm share/bookmarklooking forward to 2014 we don’t really believe in resolutions, but we’re all for reflections, and as we wrote this list of things we’d like to accomplish in 2014, we realized it was something we could share with all of you. - thought/design you told us you liked the posts on the design of the guide’s pack and founder’s briefcase and we hear you; we want to work on more posts for more bags that explain the thought that goes into each pocket, each seam. - our awesome crew this is something we work on/think about a lot — we’ve got one of the best crews in the business, from design to production to customer service to shipping, and we want to make sure they know they’re that great. we came up with (what we think) were some good ways of showing our appreciation in 2013 (better benefits, raises, more lunch parties) but we want to top that in 2014. one idea: a monitor/tv where in which your tweets and photos and posts complimenting our crew and the fine bags they make scroll past. - more efficient as you well know, our bags are often on backorder (demand is greater than production). we think with a few small tweaks (mostly, looking at how things work and stripping away the unnecessary stuff) we can get even more efficient and be able to make even more bags, as we continue to hire more/add to our seattle factory crew. - what’s fun, what’s not a rule we often use around here: if we’re having fun doing x, great. if it’s a drag, why is it a drag? maybe it’s something we shouldn’t be doing. or, maybe it’s something someone else would be way better at, and we could hire that person to do that thing. always a good rule to reassess with. tb crew | 1 january 2014 5:00 am share/bookmarklooking back at 2013 it sure felt like a busy year, but until we compiled this list, we didn’t realize just how much we’d accomplished. new designs: synapse 25 the guide’s pack founder’s briefcase knitting tool pouches cache for ipad air motto and pattern water bottles cafe bag for jung’s the red book (april fools) utility strap 1″ cafe/ristretto messenger stabilizer smart alec modular pockets + gate keeper straps pilot (design completed december 2013; pre-order january 2014) updated designs: the cadet synapse 19 side effect handle loop new materials: 420 denier high tenacity “parapack” pack fabric 400d dyneema®/420d nylon ripstop black 400d dyneema®/420d nylon ripstop videos: materials testing tom bihn style innovation in fabrics all about the red, white and blue, while being green one week in montreal how to tie cord zipper pulls adjusting the internal frame in the guide’s pack the guide’s pack and founder’s briefcase synapse 25, ristretto, swift three trips with the aeronaut our materials two weeks in japan part i and part ii amy singer, knitty.com, and the swift the smart alec packing the smart alec backpack for a hike the new side effect tom on design the tri-star travel bag how the checkpoint friendly rails system works kieu’s mad bartacking skills q-am shoulder strap interviews: the setup modestics meet the maker: tom bihn tb crew | 31 december 2013 11:23 am share/bookmarkscotte22: my first “what’s in my bag?” video “finally got around to my first ever tb video. it went a little long because, like others on the forum, i’m a nerd when it comes to describing my gadgets.” head over to the forums for scotte22′s packing list + a chance to ask him questions about his packing methodology. tb crew | 26 december 2013 10:24 am share/bookmarkhappy holidays from the tb crew! whether it snows for six days and six nights or twelve days and twelve nights, here’s to you and yours having a good holiday. merry christmas from the tom bihn crew! tb crew | 25 december 2013 11:26 am share/bookmarkshop bags + christmas shipping update just in time: large shop bags are in stock and ready to ship. want your stuff delivered on christmas eve?
