eero - finally, wifi that works buy nowbuy nowyour homefeaturestechnologysupportsupporttechnologyfeaturesyour homethe only wifi system with truemeshyou need multiple access pointsdistance may be good for the heart, but it weakens wifi signal. same goes for walls, appliances, neighbors’ networks, metal, water heaters, anything solid. in a nutshell, modern wifi uses two frequencies to transmit data: 5 ghz waves (the new 802.11ac standard) that are able to transmit more data, but are limited to shorter distances; and 2.4 ghz waves (the older 802.11n standard) that transmit less data but are able to travel farther distances. so, in order to take advantage of 5 ghz speeds, you need multiple access points — devices that broadcast wifi — distributed throughout your home, so you’re always close to one.until now, recreating this sort of setup at home has meant expensive ethernet wiring, painful manual setup, custom firmware, and an it person. eero makes this enterprise model simple, elegant, and easy for anyone to manage. multiple eeros automatically connect to form a wireless mesh network. unlike the “hub-and-spoke” model of a single router and a range extender, each eero in the network is created equal and the result is an incredibly fast, reliable network.the power of truemeshtruemesh™ is the core software and mesh routing algorithm that powers eero networks. it’s the next generation of wireless mesh technology, custom-built from the ground up to work perfectly with eero. taking full advantage of the hardware, it means that your wifi is not only fast and resilient, but also intelligently adapts to your home.hyper-fast network (lan) speedtruemesh uses advanced, proprietary protocols to ensure that the link between every eero over the local area network (or lan) is stronger than ever before, which means that data can move through your home at even faster speeds.intelligent wifi that adapts to your hometruemesh understands your network’s full topology – how all of your eeros are connected to each other and to all of the connected devices in your home – in real time. it always finds the best route for data and quickly switches paths to avoid any interference.flexibility to add as many as you needwith truemesh, data ‘hops’ through as many eeros as you need. at roughly 40 feet per hop, that means you could easily deliver enough bandwidth from one end of a football field to the other, and still be able to stream 4k netflix in the end zone.truemesh animationdynamic rerouting means that data can take multiple pathways to reach a device, optimizing for the fastest, most reliable path.the disappointment of range “extenders”if you’ve ever tried to give your router a boost with an “extender,” then you’ve experienced true disappointment. that’s because “extenders” can only stretch your signal a single hop — you can’t connect multiple in a row. they often create an entirely separate network (ssid), so you find yourself having to continually switch from one network to the other as you move through your house. worse, many range “extenders” cut your bandwidth in half because they rely on a single wireless radio to both send and receive data. in contrast, each eero has two radios — both of which communicate with your devices and sync with other eeros — so your connection is always fast. and with truemesh, eero supports multiple hops, making it possible to cover a home of any shape or size. not only does an eero system operate on a single network name (ssid), but you can also walk throughout your home and devices like your iphone will connect to the nearest eero.why do range extenders underperform?under the hoodwe designed eero with an incredible attention to detail. it’s engineered from the ground up to achieve the best performance with the smallest footprint possible. that means fitting a powerful dual-core 1 ghz cpu, two state-of-the-art 802.11ac wifi radios, and 5 antennas into a beautiful enclosure that you can hold in the palm of your hand.tech specswant to get into the technical nitty gritty?dimensionswidth: 4.75in (121mm)depth: 4.75in (121mm)height: 1.34in (34mm)security and networking serviceswpa2 personal wireless encryption,dhcp, nat, vpn passthrough, upnp, static ip, and port forwarding.processor, memory, and storage1.0 ghz dual-core processor512mb ram4gb flash storageelectrical and environmental requirements100-240v ac, 50-60hz, operating temperature: 32° to 95° f (0° to 35° c), operating relative humidity: 20% to 80% (non-condensing)wireless connectivitydual-band wifi radios, simultaneous 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wireless, 2x2 mimo, ieee 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, bluetooth® smart readyrequired for setupsupported ios or android™ device with data connection. see eero.com/requirementswired connectivitydual auto-sensing gigabit ports for wan (cable or dsl modem) and/or lan (networked device) connectivity, usb 2.0 portwarranty1-year limited warranty. see eero.com/legal/warrantysetup requirementseero ios or android app, internet service (with cable or dsl modem, if required)see requirementsbusinessgrade wififor your homebuy nowbuy nowour storyjobsblogpresslegalprorequired© 2017 eero inc.san francisco, cabuy nowbuy now
