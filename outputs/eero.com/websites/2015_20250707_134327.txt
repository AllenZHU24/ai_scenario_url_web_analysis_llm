eero: finally, wifi that works keep me posted details about us developers faqs welcome to eero! details about us developers keep me posted eero details everything you need to know about eero. your wifi problems,gone in 60 seconds your first eero simply plugs into your existing cable or dsl modem. then just download the app and it will instantly recognize your eero and prompt you to create your own network name and password. additional eeros just need power from a standard wall outlet. you place them around your home with the help of the app. that’s it. you now have a single wifi network that covers every inch of your home. finally wifi that just works keep me posted your browser does not support the video tag. never reset your router again if there’s an issue with your wifi, do you call the cable company or just reset your router? today, you're completely in the dark. but not with eero. your system regularly runs checkups so you'll always know exactly what's going on: the devices that are connected to your network, the speeds you're achieving throughout your home, what interference is being caused by neighbors' networks and how your modem and cable service are performing. in the unlikely case that an eero goes down momentarily (say, because of a power outage), it simply reboots itself and fixes the problem – before you ever know there’s a problem. put away the paper clip. be our guest send guests your network's login info straight from your phone via text message. no need to dig through that drawer in the kitchen. better still, if your guests have the eero app, you can securely add them to your network with the touch of a button – they don't even have to enter a password. from the app, you choose how long their access lasts. social networking, indeed. security that's always one step ahead eero can alert you whenever a device joins your network and send you a weekly digest of all devices that have used your network. knowledge is power. and eero's auto-updating software means you'll always have state-of-the-art security for your network. no need to stop everything to download the latest patch. bluetooth to help build your connected home every eero comes with built-in bluetooth, which allows the eero app to connect with your first eero for quick and simple setup. but it also means that your home is blanketed in both wifi and bluetooth, the two standards that are fast becoming the glue of the connected home. what's a mesh network anyway? you'll never reliably cover your entire home with a single router because wifi signal degrades with distance. interference from walls, home electronics and your neighbors' wifi only makes things worse. and even if you hardwire your home for multiple routers, you'll likely need professional installation to avoid having to switch from one network to another as you walk around your home. eeros work together to form a mesh network, a technology formerly only available to the enterprise. unlike traditional routers and extenders that only allow for data to make a single hop, eero allows for multiple hops with minimal signal loss. you can connect up to 10 eeros – so even if your home's made an appearance on cribs, we've got you covered. there are multiple paths for transferring data. if a door closes or a cordless phone causes interference, eero dynamically routes around it by taking an alternate path or using a different frequency band. the new 802.11ac standard exclusively uses 5ghz radio spectrum, which is much less crowded and has more channels than 2.4ghz spectrum. depending on current network conditions, eero will automatically switch between 2.4 and 5ghz frequency bands, using whichever is most free and clear. how is eero better than a range extender? technical specs dimensions width: 4.75in (121mm) depth: 4.75in (121mm) height: 0.85 - 1.26in (22 - 33mm) security and networking services wpa2 personal / enterprise, 802.1x dhcp, nat, vpn passthrough, dns proxy, ipv6 processor, memory, and storage 1.0ghz dual-core processor 512mb ram 1gb flash storage electrical and environmental requirements 100-240v ac, 50-60hz operating temperature: 32° to 95° f (0° to 35° c) operating relative humidity: 20% to 80% (non-condensing) wireless connectivity dual wifi radios simultaneous 2.4ghz and 5ghz wireless ieee 802.11a/b/g/n/ac bluetooth 4.0 with bluetooth low energy software and setup requirements ios/android application web browser wired connectivity dual auto-sensing gigabit ports for wan (cable or dsl modem) and lan (networked device) connectivity usb 2.0 port warranty 1-year limited warranty have more questions? check our faq please enter in a valid email address thanks! we always email responsibly. faq blog privacy policy terms of service eero will be available to order later this year. pre-orders are now closed. let’s be friends in the meantime. please enter in a valid email address thanks! we'll keep you posted.
