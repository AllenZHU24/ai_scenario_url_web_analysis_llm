if your internet service provider does not provide you with the maximum supported speed, you will not experience that maximum speed. maximum network speeds, if applicable, reflect combined supported speeds across wired and wireless clients. maximum wireless signal rates are derived from ieee 802.11 standard. specifications assume wired ethernet connection; your experienced speed may vary when connected to an eero device that is configured as a wireless extender. coverage estimates are based on normal use conditions. actual range and performance can vary, and maximum supported speeds may not be available to all customers, due to factors such as local regulations (including power limits), network configuration, interference, connected devices, device usage, building materials, and obstructions. specifications are based on use of a wi-fi 6 or later client device. for more information about eero performance, visit support.eero.com.productsexperiencetechnologyeero built-ineero plus supportfind your systemcookie preferencesfor businessfor pro installersfor service providerscareersblogmedia roomlegalwhere to buyconnect with usfor the latest eero news and promotions.submitoops! please enter a valid email address© 2023 eero llc, san francisco, causausacanukaus
