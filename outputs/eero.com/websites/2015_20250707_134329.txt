eero: finally, wifi that works keep me posted details about us developers faqs welcome to eero! details about us developers keep me posted about us what we're all about believe it or not, youtube was only founded in ‘05. two years later, netflix launched streaming with a mere 1000 titles. the connected home – everything from networked speakers to cloud-connected refrigerators – is an even more recent phenomenon. and wifi is the foundation for it all. increasingly, it makes our favorite devices and experiences come alive. it makes our houses into homes. but it’s broken. many of us have abandoned the parts of our homes that are wifi dead zones. others have hidden equipment that looks like something out of blade runner in a closet. and nearly all of us have suffered confusing setup and painful passwords. the core utility of the 21st century is broken. we’re fixing it. nick weaver co-founder | chief executive officer nate hardison co-founder amos schallich co-founder james howarth hardware the eero team excited about solving today's (and tomorrow's) connectivity problems? send us a note at join@eero.com. or find out more here. mar snider marketing sean harris marketing giancarlo daniele engineering vikas yendluri engineering rob ashe design rowan chakoumakos engineering chris johnson engineering please enter in a valid email address thanks! we always email responsibly. faq blog privacy policy terms of service eero will be available to order later this year. pre-orders are now closed. let’s be friends in the meantime. please enter in a valid email address thanks! we'll keep you posted.
