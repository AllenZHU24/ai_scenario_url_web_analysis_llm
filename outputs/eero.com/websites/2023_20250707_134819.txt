if canada is specified, excludes quebec, and newfoundland & labrador. the “offer” is for a bundle that consists of (1) the specified eero device(s) (the “offer device(s)”) and (2) access to and use of the eero plus service for the plan duration specified (the “offer service”), sold on eero.com. use of eero plus and other eero products and services is subject to the eero legal policies available at eero.com/legal. if you violate any of these terms, this offer will be invalid. offer is non-transferable, may not be resold, and may not be combined with other offers or discounts. if any of the products or content related to this offer are returned, any refund will equal the proportional amount you paid for the product, subject to applicable refund policies. eero reserves the right to modify or cancel this offer at any time. valid for customers only who are not current eero for business subscribers, and who do not currently receive from their internet service provider an eero device, the eero app, or an eero product or service (including eero plus or eero secure). the offer service is linked to the unique serial number(s) for each offer device, and may only be activated by setting up the associated offer device(s) on an eero network; however you may include other eero devices (from other orders or sources) in your eero network. the offer service will be associated with the eero account first used to set-up an offer device, and will start on the day of set-up (unless you are an existing eero plus subscriber - see below in that case). the offer service is a prepaid plan for the specified duration and does not renew (but if you are an existing eero plus subscriber - your previous subscription will continue, as further described below). by purchasing this offer, you will be ineligible for a free trial of the offer service that you may otherwise be eligible for. existing eero plus subscribers: if the eero account first used to set-up an offer device has an existing eero plus subscription on the date of set-up (including any free trial period), then the existing subscription will continue until the next renewal billing date that is at least 24 hours after such set-up date, at which point the offer service plan will start. when the offer service plan ends, the existing subscription will then continue, including automatic renewal if applicable, in accordance with the terms agreed to at time of signing up to the existing subscription.some features require linking your amazon account, and downloading the alexa application or using a compatible alexa device. internet connection speeds and availability depend on your internet service provider; if your internet service provider does not provide you with the maximum supported speed, you will not experience that maximum speed. maximum network speeds, if applicable, reflect combined supported speeds across wired and wireless clients. maximum wireless signal rates are derived from ieee 802.11 standard. specifications assume wired ethernet connection; your experienced speed may vary when connected to an eero device that is configured as a wireless extender. coverage estimates are based on normal use conditions. actual range and performance can vary, and maximum supported speeds may not be available to all customers, due to factors such as local regulations (including power limits), network configuration, interference, connected devices, device usage, building materials, and obstructions. specifications are based on use of a wi-fi 6 (or in canada, wi-fi 6e) or later generation client device that supports 160 mhz. combining eero pro 6e devices with older generation eero devices on the same network may result in reduced performance across the network. for more information about eero performance, visit support.eero.comeeroproductsexperiencetechnologyeero built-ineero plus supportfind your systemwhere to buyfor service providersfor pro installersfor businessfor communitiescareersblogmedia roomlegalconnect with usfor the latest eero news and promotions.submitoops! please enter a valid email address.an error occurred. please contact support if this issue persists.your ads, privacy, and cookie choices© 2023 eero llc, san francisco, causausacanukaus
