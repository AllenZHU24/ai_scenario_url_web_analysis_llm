these friendly rockers came by before embarking on a weekend's worth of soundblasting a sonically starved nyc scene. between the ambitious and inventive selections picked by emil, the sm mainman, there was lots of insightful conversation to be had. so much so to the point whereupon being reminded about their strict itinerary by a maneesh crewmember, he brushed it off and said, "that's fine, let's talk about music." ok then! so yes, a rocking naked fridays with a classical bent (but not in a hairy prog rock kind of way) that adequately represents the creative direction of this ambitious group, highlighted by 3 of their own tracks. rtx - dude love amon düül ii - jalousie spacemen 3 - revolution serena maneesh - i just want to see your face robert wyatt - insensetez dymaxion - use once and destroy popol vuh - huter der schweille harmonia 76 - when shade was born serena maneesh - reprobate!
