so much effort into developing one of the world’s best phone cameras. the result is the world’s thinnest dual camera system built for a phone. it uses both color and monochrome sensors that can capture up to 200% more light than traditional phone cameras. this results in stunning images that are rich in color and detail, even in low light. the phone also offers a true ‘monochrome’ mode. the front-facing camera is capable of producing 8mp still photos and 4k video, all in a compact form factor designed to blend seamlessly into our full display™. beauty meets brawn there’s a reason titanium is used to build rockets and replace bones. unlike aluminum, which most phones are made of, titanium is exceptionally more durable. our phone housing can resist scratching, denting, and bending as it's made from a harder, stronger, and more resilient material. we believe titanium is the perfect material to create one of the most essential things in our lives – one we all sometimes drop. acc the drop test. we drop tested the essential phone on solid concrete to ensure that your phone could survive a bad accident. see it in slow motion. *tested on essential phones with natural
