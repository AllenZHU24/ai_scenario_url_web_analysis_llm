master quality authenticated (mqa) is a way of packaging digital music without limitations. nearly all of the music you hear from your favorite streaming service or the songs you've purchased from an online store have had information stripped out of them. they're compressed, so they take up less space on your device or don't use as much cellular data when you stream them. but that information contains elements the artist created to intensify your connection with their music—so, in essence, you don't hear the entire song. mqa is a new way of capturing and unpacking those songs that gives a lossless, studio-master audio experience in a smaller size. so you hear the richness and depth of every guitar string; every delicate vocal nuance; every piercing vibrato from a horn; and everything else the artist created in the studio without losing a single thing. and all without sacrificing your device's storage or cellular data. to learn more about how master quality authenticated works, visit mqa’s website. what do i need to hear mqa songs? first, you need a device that supports mqa (that's essential phone). next, the music files on your device, or your music source, will also need to support mqa (and hey, tidal supports mqa, and has lots of music). with just those two things and your trusty headphones, you'll enjoy a higher-quality audio experience. to get the full, blow-your-socks-off, studio-quality audio experience, the last thing you'll need is something to fully decode the music—like a digital-to-analog converter (dac). and whaddya know, our audio adapter hd is a dac. and that's coming this summer! but if you can't wait, you can get a usb dac and a usb-c to usb adapter to use with your essential phone right now. visit mqa’s website to see a list of usb dac’s. how do i know if the songs i'm listening to have mqa?
