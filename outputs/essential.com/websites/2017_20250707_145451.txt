why 360 changes everything icon_360_cam xiaoyu miaomay 1, 2017 share this facebook twitter linkedin why 360 changes everything i think the 360 camera is going to become the next big battlefield. and growth in the industry will come from content, cameras, and streaming. i want to push the industry forward and help our customers. if you look at a 360 camera, there is a fundamental difference between it and a conventional camera. it provides a means to record a scene around a user. if you think about the historical view of photography, it has not changed since the first version of the camera. people pick up a camera, aim a lens, and look for a particular thing to capture based on a viewfinder. and that camera has a very limited field of view. the 360 camera captures the entire world around the user, which fundamentally changes how we take a picture. you don’t have to aim your camera, because you capture everything in your world. i think that’s a major difference. but the industry today has two major issues: 1) the cameras are bulky and expensive, especially if you want a good one; and 2) the user experience and workflow for taking a picture and uploading it to your social network is cumbersome. i wanted to work hard on those aspects to make a miniaturized 360 camera that’s affordable and easy to use for most users. share this facebook twitter linkedin next article follow: facebook twitter instagram snapchat 380 portage ave, palo alto, ca 94306 +1 650 300-0000 info@essential.com terms of use privacy policy © essential 2017. all rights reserved icon_phone phone introduction accessories materials colors screen camera specifications reserve icon_home home introduction easy interactions proactive help ambient os stay tuned about blog support reserve introduction team join us investors contact us press kit english français 中文 deutsch 日本語 icon_arrowhead_right introduction accessories materials colors screen camera specifications reserve icon_arrowhead_right introduction easy interactions proactive help ambient os stay tuned icon_arrowhead_right introduction team join us investors contact us press kit icon_phone phone icon_home home about blog reserve support english icon_arrowhead_right français 中文 deutsch 日本語 asset 97 en
