what craftsmanship means to us icon_material linda and jasonmay 27, 2017 share this facebook twitter linkedin what craftsmanship means to us when you pick something up, there’s an unconscious acknowledgment of whether it’s good or bad. jason: craftsmanship is the intangible quality that a customer senses when they pick up a product for the first time. the experience one feels as the product rests in your hand, there’s an unconscious acknowledgement of whether it’s good or bad. if you hold a poorly crafted product, you can feel the haste in which it was rushed through the r&d process. this abstract notion is impossible to hide. it just doesn’t feel right. a watchmaker has dedicated themselves to studying their craft — often attending a special school and starting out as an apprentice and then working on all aspects of the process to finally become a master watchmaker. the result is a level of unparalleled craftsmanship that is coveted and often proudly worn on their customer’s wrist. the thing about titanium (used in our phone) is that it’s stiff. really -- it won’t bend. often found in aerospace designs for similar reasons, it allows us to use thinner walls and have more room for bigger batteries inside. we can also shrink the borders of the product without having to worry that the display will get damaged if the phone is dropped. but it wasn’t easy to get. i literally went around the world three times before i found a partner that shared our vision. but i’m glad we did, because the finished product is beautiful. linda: we made the back of the phone with this beautiful colored ceramic. if you’ve never seen it, ceramic has this pleasant, organic luster that you don’t find in glass, or in anything else… part of my job is to scour the earth to find new technologies that can be applied to our products to make them stand-out in our customer’s hands and mind. from a designers perspective, i enjoy the challenge of seeking out materials that are clean and flawless — leaving you with a sensation that you’re holding something magical in your hand. and we found it with ceramic. in designing devices, you’re usually counting millimeter. the challenge with ceramic is that it’s like pottery. you have to fire it, and when you do, the material shrinks 25%. we spent months and months, but we eventually honed in on a process that allowed us to get cost down to the point where it’s both feasible and flawless. i’ll never forget when the first sample came back from the factory. we immediately saw how beautiful it was. it’s almost metallic, cool to the touch — yet it’s not metal. it has a depth that you can’t replicate with plastic, and you can’t scratch it. i love it. share this facebook twitter linkedin next article products phone home accessories shop essential phone 360 camera case for 360 camera earphones|hd™ audio adapter incipio slim case fast charger community blog support submit a request student program 360° gallery about introduction team join us investors contact us press kit facebook twitter instagram terms of service privacy policy © essential 2018. all rights reserved. 380 portage ave, palo alto, california 94306 asset 126 phone introduction colors accessories materials screen camera specifications order asset 127 home introduction easy interactions proactive help ambient os stay tuned asset 125 accessories about introduction team join us investors contact us press kit 360° blog support english français 中文（简体） 中文（繁體） deutsch 日本語 shop_icon shop icon_arrowhead_right introduction colors accessories materials screen camera specifications order icon_arrowhead_right introduction easy interactions proactive help ambient os stay tuned icon_arrowhead_right icon_arrowhead_right introduction team join us investors contact us press kit shop_icon shop asset 126 phone asset 127 home asset 125 accessories about 360° blog shop support english icon_arrowhead_right français 中文（简体） 中文（繁體） deutsch 日本語 asset 97 asset 128 we’ve updated our privacy policy. if you continue to browse our website, you accept our revised privacy policy, and the use of cookies to measure the performance of our website and to deliver you with advertisements tailored to your preferences. learn more at our cookie policy. continue en
