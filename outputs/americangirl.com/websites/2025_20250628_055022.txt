cleanup. check out our helpful hints for upkeep in the hair & skin care section to have your doll looking fresh and clean in no time.can i wash doll hair? if so, how do i wash it?we don't recommend regular washing of the doll's hair since it can become frizzy and damaged. however, sometimes spills happen and the hair needs to be cleaned. if that's the case, we can help. call one of our doll doctors at 800-772-0430, or email them at dolldoctor@americangirl.com, and they can walk you through the steps to make sure the hair comes out looking its best.what's the best way to brush doll hair?doll hair needs special care to stay looking its best. you'll want to start with the right tools because the techniques are different depending on if the doll has straight, curly, or textured hair. you can find detailed tips on brushing, misting, and styling all types of american girl doll hair in our hair & skin care section.how can i make doll curls look like new again?whatever type of curls your doll has—wavy, curly, or very curly—we can help you restore them to their original condition! please visit our doll hair how-to's for some fun videos that show exactly what to do.can i remove the wave from braided doll hair?if your girl has a doll like molly® or kaya®, who has had braids for a long time, her hair will likely have waves when you take out the braids—just like your hair would. to lessen the wave, lightly mist her hair with water and gently brush it with a wire doll hairbrush from the bottom up. although it may take a little time, the wave will gradually lessen. if you have other questions about how to care for doll hair or if you want to learn some new styles, visit our hair & skin care section.doll care center admissions and treatmentshow can i send my doll to the doll care center?visit the doll care center, then scroll down to choose the type of doll you want to admit. next, select a care-and-repair service to continue the process. be sure to follow the instructions on the form to ensure a quick return.how long does a visit to the doll care center usually take?a doll care center visit takes approximately two to four weeks, depending on volume, from the date of admission for the patient until her return home. because of the high volume of patients sent in december, we recommend that any doll who needs to be home in time for the winter holidays be shipped to american girl no later than the middle of november.does rush delivery make the doll care center visit any shorter?dolls are repaired in the order in which they are received. if you choose rush shipping for the return of your doll, you will receive her more quickly than via standard shipping.i sent my doll to the doll care center. how can i learn about her status?to help you track your doll's progress through the process, we will email you on three occasions:• we will send an email confirmation after you submit your order. this email will have a link to print your admission paperwork and instructions on how to send your doll to the doll care center.• when we receive your doll, to confirm admission and placement in the treatment queue• when your doll is shipped back to you for a healthy homecomingwhy don’t you provide services for dolls from the united kingdom?due to tax rules for packages shipped to residents of the united kingdom (england, northern ireland, scotland, and wales), offering services to the united kingdom is no longer feasible.will a wellness visit make my doll look brand new?our goal with wellness services is to return dolls looking as much like new as possible; however, this service has some limitations and will leave some signs of play. the wellness visit includes general cleaning of the vinyl, which removes surface dirt, plus hair brushing. because vinyl is very porous, a general cleaning will not remove stains caused by makeup, colored markers, pens, ink, strong dyes found in some textiles, or scrapes in the vinyl. hair brushing will not improve dry, frizzy, or damaged wig hair.does the doll care center provide services for archived and retired dolls?yes, we will continue to provide doll care center services for our archived and retired dolls, but we cannot guarantee replacement parts will be available.does the doll care center provide services for create your own dolls?yes, we do provide services for create your own dolls, but cannot guarantee replacement parts will be available. if we do have the parts available, they may require a special order from our manufacturer which will increase the length of your doll’s stay at the doll care center.do you repair non-american girl dolls?no, we only repair american girl dolls.one of my doll's eyes won't open anymore. should i admit her to the doll care center?yes, our doll doctors can assess the eyes and replace them if needed.can i replace just the wig on my doll?regrettably, our doll care center staff is unable to replace wigs. to ensure the wig will not come off, our doll manufacturer applies permanent glue. to remove the wig would be very difficult and could result in damaging the doll's head. if there is a problem with the hair, the entire head must be replaced.my doll's head came off. how do i tie the head back on?please follow these steps:• lay the doll chest-down, across your lap. insert the head into the body face-up.• crisscross the two ends of the string, then pull the ends tightly using slow, even pressure (so the seam does not rip out) until there is no gap between the neck and body. it can be helpful to have a second person assist by keeping the tension tight.• double- or triple-knot the string to secure it.• carefully turn the doll's head back to its original position.my doll’s leg is loose and wobbly. can you tighten it?occasionally the elastic cords used to attach a doll's limbs to her torso seem too stretchy. however, this stretch, called "pliability," is necessary for the cords to last longer. without pliability, the cords would easily fray because of the extra tension on them. if the limb seems very floppy and the limb dangles from the socket, it's definitely time to send her to the doll care center for a limb reattachment.how do i remove ink from my doll's face?a damp washcloth may help to remove lighter marks, but ink or marker stains may require more effort. for these tougher stains, please contact us at service@americangirl.com, and we can provide a stain-removal process you can do at home that is highly successful. you also have the option of admitting your doll to the doll care center for a limb or head replacement.my doll’s torso seems to have lost some of its stuffing. can you fix this?yes, we can adjust the stuffing to ensure your doll has just the right amount.can you repaint the lips or eyebrows on my doll?no, unfortunately we are unable to perform this service.can i admit my doll for a head replacement and get a different character head?regrettably, we are unable to change characters on a doll when a head replacement is done.if my doll’s ears are pierced and she needs her head replaced, will she still return home with pierced ears?yes, we will pierce the ears on the replacement head at no extra charge.can you remove the marks on my bitty baby’s head?with a wellness visit, we provide a general cleaning to remove surface dirt from the vinyl, but unfortunately, we are unable to remove the marks on bitty’s head. we recommend a head replacement to correct this issue.how do i get my doll's ears pierced?ear piercing is an add-on service, which means you must admit your doll and select a doll care center treatment to add earrings to your 18" american girl or welliewishers™ doll.modelinghow can my girl become an american girl model?american
