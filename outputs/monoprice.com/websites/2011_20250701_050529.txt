in other words, does the sum of its parts add up to what you paid for that 6 foot cable? chances are, if you bought it from somewhere else, it does not. the fair price is what you'll find on our site. because we remain highly focused on customer satisfaction, we like to think of monoprice.com as a service rather than a store. please don't forget to check our resellerratings.com customer ratings and reviews. if you haven't yet purchased online, this is the best way to start!! getting the most for your money it's not just about getting a great price. there's no sense in buying a product that doesn't perform or won't last. quality is a high priority at monoprice. in addition to the comprehensive testing that is done at the factory level, we have a local product testing lab and experienced technicians that test new products as well as sample test current items to make sure that quality standards are being adhered to. the results of these efforts have been supported by the high rankings given by users in the product reviews on our website and in professional reviews by well known technology media. a few websites that have reviewed or mentioned our products include: •	cnet •	gizmodo •	audioholics •	engadget •	new york times •	cnn money •	geekbrief.tv •	maxim magazine a quick search on avs forum and youtube will also result in many positive user reviews of our products. rapid growth and order fulfillment in a fairly short time, monoprice has grown from a small in-home operation to huge enterprise employing over 150 full and temporary employees. the company has recently moved to a 173,000 square-foot centralized office and warehouse facility with plans for further expansion for greater coverage in the future. new automated and computerized order fulfillment systems have been implemented to ensure greater accuracy and efficiency. we are constantly looking for ways to improve the order fulfillment process including better ways to train customer service and warehouse personnel, stronger supply side relations and using the latest warehouse technologies. privacy and security at monoprice.com, we understand and respect your concern about the privacy of any information you supply while on our site. we do not sell or share information about our customers to any third parties. any information we collect from you is only used in fulfillment of your order. please see our privacy statement at: http://www.monoprice.com/home/home.asp?pn=privacy. office address office hour monoprice, inc. 11701 6th street rancho cucamonga, ca 91730 telephone : (909)989-6887 fax : (909)989-0078 monday ~ friday: 7:15am ~ 6:45pm pacific time saturday ~ sunday: 9:00am ~ 6:00pm pacific time will call hours monday ~ friday: 10:00am ~ 5:00pm pacific time e-mail please click here to contact us. my account • my account • order status • track my order • rma request customer service • contact us • return policy • new account registration • technical support shopping info. • support • privacy policy • product catalog • p.o. terms & conditions company info. • company information • newsroom • newsletters • customer testimonials payment methods • credit card • paypal • google checkout • check / money order copyright © 2001-2012 monoprice, inc. all rights reserved. all trademarks are the sole property of their respective companies. all prices and specifications are subject to change without notice. monoprice is not responsible for typographical errors. all typographical errors are subject to correction. - w2
