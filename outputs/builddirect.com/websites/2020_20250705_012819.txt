a.the prices on our website are offered to anyone who meets our minimum order requirements. that means that if you are a homeowner, or a large construction company, builddirect’s prices are available to you when you buy in pallet and container quantities. q. i want to buy from builddirect. what are my options? a. builddirect is a wholesaler with proprietary internet technology and toll-free customer service to provide incredibly low prices on top quality building products. we process orders for building materials in two ways. the first is selling pallet multiples out of warehouses around north america. the second is shipping container orders directly from select manufacturers and delivered to your job site or distribution point of your choice. q. which forms of payment do you accept?

how does that work? a.yes. a residential delivery is considered completed once the product is placed on the driveway. some products require a vehicle with a lift-gate, depending on weight. the pallets would be lowered to the ground and pulled onto your driveway with a pallet-jack. you may be required to unload the vehicle yourself, depending on the product. building materials are heavy and will require proper equipment or labour to accept goods on delivery. please check weight of goods before they are delivered so you are properly prepared. consult the faqs by category for the details on your product of interest, or call a builddirect sales rep for more information. q. when ordering containers, can i mix-and-match on colors and styles of material?
