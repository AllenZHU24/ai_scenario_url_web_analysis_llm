go to your “orders” tab in your profile to track your order. when will i receive my order? unfortunately, we cannot offer guarantees on standard order and container shipment timelines. most standard orders take 6-14 business days depending on how far the product has to travel to reach you. if the product is out of stock, however, wait time is approximately 6-8 weeks. container orders generally take 8-10 weeks from time payment is received. there is a chance that it may take longer because of factors beyond our control. for example, security measures undertaken by u.s. customs and border protection could possibly delay shipment of container orders. never miss the chance to improve your home! sign up to receive email updates on promotions, sales and more. subscribe facebook translation missing: en.general.social.links.linkedin instagram youtube twitter stay in touch 1-877-631-2845 (toll free in north america) customerservice@builddirect.com customer service my account track your order shipping return policy faq contact us about builddirect about us pro rewards careers investor relations & press resources learning center blog learn about financing ©2001-2023 builddirect privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy 30 day money back guarantee choosing a selection results in a full page refresh. opens in a new window. net orders checkout item price qty total subtotal $0.00 shipping total shipping address united states --- afghanistan åland islands albania algeria andorra angola anguilla antigua & barbuda argentina armenia aruba australia austria azerbaijan bahamas bahrain bangladesh barbados belarus belgium belize benin bermuda bhutan bolivia bosnia & herzegovina botswana bouvet island brazil british indian ocean territory british virgin islands brunei bulgaria burkina faso burundi cambodia cameroon canada cape verde cayman islands central african republic chad chile china christmas island cocos (keeling) islands colombia comoros congo - brazzaville congo - kinshasa cook islands costa rica croatia cuba curaçao cyprus czech republic côte d’ivoire denmark djibouti dominica dominican republic ecuador egypt el salvador equatorial guinea eritrea estonia ethiopia falkland islands faroe islands fiji finland france french guiana french polynesia french southern territories gabon gambia georgia germany ghana gibraltar greece greenland grenada guadeloupe guatemala guernsey guinea guinea-bissau guyana haiti heard & mcdonald islands honduras hong kong sar china hungary iceland india indonesia iran iraq ireland isle of man israel italy jamaica japan jersey jordan kazakhstan kenya kiribati kosovo kuwait kyrgyzstan laos latvia lebanon lesotho liberia libya liechtenstein lithuania luxembourg macau sar china macedonia madagascar malawi malaysia maldives mali malta martinique mauritania mauritius mayotte mexico moldova monaco mongolia montenegro montserrat morocco mozambique myanmar (burma) namibia nauru nepal netherlands netherlands antilles new caledonia new zealand nicaragua niger nigeria niue norfolk island north korea norway oman pakistan palestinian territories panama papua new guinea paraguay peru philippines pitcairn islands poland portugal qatar réunion romania russia rwanda saint martin samoa san marino são tomé & príncipe saudi arabia senegal serbia seychelles sierra leone singapore slovakia slovenia solomon islands somalia south africa south georgia & south sandwich islands south korea south sudan spain sri lanka st. barthélemy st. helena st. kitts & nevis st. lucia st. martin st. pierre & miquelon st. vincent & grenadines sudan suriname svalbard & jan mayen swaziland sweden switzerland syria taiwan tajikistan tanzania thailand timor-leste togo tokelau tonga trinidad & tobago tunisia turkey turkmenistan turks & caicos islands tuvalu u.s. outlying islands uganda ukraine united arab emirates united kingdom united states uruguay uzbekistan vanuatu vatican city venezuela vietnam wallis & futuna western sahara yemen zambia zimbabwe alabamaalaskaamerican samoaarizonaarkansascaliforniacoloradoconnecticutdelawaredistrict of columbiafederated states of micronesiafloridageorgiaguamhawaiiidahoillinoisindianaiowakansaskentuckylouisianamainemarshall islandsmarylandmassachusettsmichiganminnesotamississippimissourimontananebraskanevadanew hampshirenew jerseynew mexiconew yorknorth carolinanorth dakotanorthern mariana islandsohiooklahomaoregonpalaupennsylvaniapuerto ricorhode islandsouth carolinasouth dakotatennesseetexasutahvermontvirgin islandsvirginiawashingtonwest virginiawisconsinwyomingarmed forces americasarmed forces europearmed forces pacific shipping methods
