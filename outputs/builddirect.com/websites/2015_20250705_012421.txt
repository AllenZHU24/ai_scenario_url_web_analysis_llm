"showing off" your product in a natural setting is a good way to show how the product is being used and placed in your home. this could inspire others to do the same! feel free to tell us your story. they say a picture is worth a thousand words but a picture doesn't always tell the complete story. we would love to hear the story behind the picture, as well as your experience with us. bad examples avoid photos of just the floor or product the photo to the left is slightly overexposed (lots of glare from a flash) and only captures the floor iteself. ideally photos would show the chairs and other furniture for a more representative look of the installed product. avoid clutter make sure that the product you have installed has been completed! remove all debris from the installation and ensure that the room has been properly cleaned and is free of dust. remove clutter from the room (items that will distract from the main subject). the simpler the photo the better! more tips photo orientation we prefer pictures in landscape format. landscape means that the horizontal side is longer than the vertical one. lighting pay attention to the amount of light coming into the room through blinds, curtains and adjust accordingly. make sure the room is lit well enough to show suitable detail in the photo. in focus use a tripod to avoid camera-shake. your images must be in focus in order to be considered for our website. how to submit photos now that you’ve met the image quality requirements and followed the examples and tips we've provided, you're ready to submit your photos. whether you’re submitting photos to your sales representative, or directly to roomscene@builddirect.com, please include “photo submissions” in the subject line, and the following information in the body of your email: customer name found on the original product order name of the product purchased an attachment, or link, to the photos then, hit send! if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, please don’t hesitate to let us know! email: sales@builddirect.com phone: toll free in north america: 1-877-631-2845 international: 604-662-8100 fax: toll free in north america: 1-877-664-2845 international: 604-662-8142 customer service hours: monday - friday: 9am - 8pm est saturday & sunday: 10am - 8pm est good luck! submission disclaimer by submitting your photos and/or comments, you grant builddirect an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to publish, reproduce and distribute your photos and/or comments in any manner builddirect deems appropriate. this includes, without limitation, all social media platforms, the world wide web and any other advertising/marketing materials or in any media now or hereafter known. your first name, location, photographs and any language contained therein, may be used for public information without consideration or compensation. you further release builddirect, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries from any and all liability, claims or damages arising out of or relating to your submission. upon review, builddirect can and may, at their sole discretion, reject, remove or disallow inclusion of any and all submissions. customer service shipping return policy faq contact us about builddirect welcome to builddirect who we are newsroom affiliates careers resources learning center room scene submissions builddirect blog design center follow us on 1-877-631-2845 sales@builddirect.com site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2015 privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2015
