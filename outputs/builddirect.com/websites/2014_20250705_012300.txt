"showing off" your product in a natural setting is a good way to show how the product is being used and placed in your home. this could inspire others to do the same! feel free to tell us your story. they say a picture is worth a thousand words but a picture doesn't always tell the complete story. we would love to hear the story behind the picture, as well as your experience with us. bad examples avoid photos of just the floor or product the photo to the left is slightly overexposed (lots of glare from a flash) and only captures the floor iteself. ideally photos would show the chairs and other furniture for a more representative look of the installed product. avoid clutter make sure that the product you have installed has been completed! remove all debris from the installation and ensure that the room has been properly cleaned and is free of dust. remove clutter from the room (items that will distract from the main subject). the simpler the photo the better! more tips photo orientation we prefer pictures in landscape format. landscape means that the horizontal side is longer than the vertical one. lighting pay attention to the amount of light coming into the room through blinds, curtains and adjust accordingly. make sure the room is lit well enough to show suitable detail in the photo. in focus use a tripod to avoid camera-shake. your images must be in focus in order to be considered for our website. how to submit photos after ensuring your photos meet the image quality requirements follow the good examples we provided, you're now ready to submit your photos. you can submit your photos to the builddirect flooring expert you were working with by e-mail, or you can submit your photos directly to roomscene@builddirect.com. please include the following information in your email: customer name used for product purchase name of the product purchased an attachment of the photos or a link to download the photos feel free to contact us if you need any help, we are always happy to lend a hand! customer service shipping return policy ordering & delivery checklist faq contact us about builddirect welcome to builddirect who we are news room affiliates careers testimonials site map resources learning center room scene viewer room scene submissions builddirect blog follow us on 1-877-631-2845 sales@builddirect.com site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2014 privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy
