and urges the u.s. government to maintain and increase aid and other positive assistance to those tropical countries which are endeavoring to implement the itto "guidelines for the sustainable management of natural tropical forests." builddirect expects to review and extend this policy as deemed necessary. purchasing policy for wood & wood products builddirect will seek the clearest practical information regarding product sources. at a minimum, this will include country of origin. builddirect will also seek evidence of good practice and forest management from all suppliers of wood products. labels or certificates warranting sustainability will not be acceptable unless they have the approval of the forestry department/ministry of source countries which have established comprehensive national forestry action plans, or until such time as an internationally acceptable criteria for sustainability is established by a recognized authority. builddirect will give preference to suppliers of all wood products from sources providing information on good silviculture and logging practices, and which are operating within the forestry laws of the country concerned. specifically with respect to tropical wood products, builddirect will give preference to purchases from countries demonstrating commitment to, and the implementation of, objective 2000 and implementation of "guidelines for the sustainable management of natural tropical forests," of the international tropical timber organization (itto). builddirect subscribes to the evolution of more efficient use of the forest resources and the wood derived from them. in this respect we support concepts of using a wider variety of species when silviculturally and ecologically appropriate and making greater economic and practical use of raw material including residues and waste. builddirect expects to review and extend this policy as deemed necessary. the u.s. lacey act on may 22, 2008, the u.s. congress passed a law banning commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products – including timber and wood products. the new law is an amendment to a 100-year old statute, named the lacey act after the congressman who first championed it. the lacey act prohibits all trade in plant and plant products (e.g. furniture, flooring, paper or lumber) that are illegally sourced from any u.s. state or any foreign country. builddirect only deals with suppliers that are 100% compliant with the lacey act. we exercise due diligence in selecting our suppliers of wood products, ensuring that our suppliers are aligned with our environmental policy for wood. and we exercise significant due care in purchasing wood products from our wood suppliers in accordance with our purchasing policy for wood & wood products. to this end, builddirect has adopted the due diligence practices for legal wood sourcing developed by the international wood products association due diligence task force. proud members of: builddirect.com technologies inc. terms of sale these terms of sale are effective september 18, 2018 please read this document carefully. it contains important information about your rights and obligations, as well as limitations and exclusions that apply to you. this agreement contains the terms and conditions (the “terms of sale”) that apply to a customer’s (“you” and where applicable “your”) purchase from builddirect.com technologies inc.
