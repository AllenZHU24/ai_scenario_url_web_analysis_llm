because slate retains heat. there’s little worry about getting out of bed in the morning, standing up, and freezing off your precious toes. more to the point, this stuff will never wear out on you. the sockless champion: underfloor heating underfloor heating is the real winner. it’s the champion of #nosocksday, and the name alone should tell you why. install underfloor heating throughout your home, and you can walk around with your bare feet out every season — even in the middle of winter. the cool part — no pun intended — is that since the apparatus goes beneath your flooring, you can still install practically anything. in fact, if you’re not worried about freezing cold floors, then underfloor heating might allow you to reconsider a flooring option you initially discounted. have you ever thought about installing heating under the floor?
