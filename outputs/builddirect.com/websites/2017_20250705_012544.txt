photo submission room scene photo submission overview image quality requirements examples and tips submitting photos room scene photo submission earn up to $100 for your photos! earn up to $100 for your photos! thank you for purchasing your home improvement materials from builddirect! we really appreciate that you’ve invested your time, effort, and money in our products. so, to prove it, we thought we’d give you the opportunity to get a little something extra back. builddirect’s cash-for-photos program gives our valued customers (that’s you!) a chance to pocket $100.00 in cold hard cash. well, more accurately, you’ll receive a warm soft cheque…but, you get the idea. to participate, simply take a picture of your finished project featuring builddirect materials, and then submit them via email either to your sales rep, or to roomscene@builddirect.com for consideration. not all pictures make the cut though, unfortunately. due to web standards, there are certain restrictions on what we’re able to accept. for tips on how to maximize your chances of approval, click on the “examples and tips” tab to the left. please also take note of the quality requirements in the “image quality requirements” tab, also to the left. there’s also one final catch: if the product you’ve taken a photo of happens to end up in our clearance section before you’re able to submit the picture, it will no longer be eligible for the $100 reward. if your photos are approved you’ll receive an email notification to congratulate you, and a cheque for $100.00 2-3 weeks later. and, of course, the coveted honor of having your stunning new renovation immortalized on our website and/or social media platforms. pretty cool, huh? image quality requirements please make sure to use the following: standalone camera quality setting of 5 megapixels or more minimum 1200x800 resolutions jpg good examples take multiple shots of the room with different lighting and angles. try to include furniture and other fixtures in a natural setting. the photo to the left has lots of natural lighting, captures the floor as well as the furniture in a nice living room setting. be creative and have fun shooting your photos. "showing off" your product in a natural setting is a good way to show how the product is being used and placed in your home. this could inspire others to do the same! feel free to tell us your story. they say a picture is worth a thousand words but a picture doesn't always tell the complete story. we would love to hear the story behind the picture, as well as your experience with us. bad examples avoid photos of just the floor or product the photo to the left is slightly overexposed (lots of glare from a flash) and only captures the floor iteself. ideally photos would show the chairs and other furniture for a more representative look of the installed product. avoid clutter make sure that the product you have installed has been completed! remove all debris from the installation and ensure that the room has been properly cleaned and is free of dust. remove clutter from the room (items that will distract from the main subject). the simpler the photo the better! more tips photo orientation we prefer pictures in landscape format. landscape means that the horizontal side is longer than the vertical one. lighting pay attention to the amount of light coming into the room through blinds, curtains and adjust accordingly. make sure the room is lit well enough to show suitable detail in the photo. in focus use a tripod to avoid camera-shake. your images must be in focus in order to be considered for our website. how to submit photos now that you’ve met the image quality requirements and followed the examples and tips we've provided, you're ready to submit your photos. whether you’re submitting photos to your sales representative, or directly to roomscene@builddirect.com, please include “photo submissions” in the subject line, and the following information in the body of your email: customer name found on the original product order name of the product purchased an attachment, or link, to the photos then, hit send! if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, please don’t hesitate to let us know! email: customerservice@builddirect.com phone: toll free in north america: 1-877-631-2845 international: 604-662-8100 fax: toll free in north america: 1-877-664-2845 international: 604-662-8142 good luck! submission disclaimer by submitting your photos and/or comments, you grant builddirect an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to publish, reproduce and distribute your photos and/or comments in any manner builddirect deems appropriate. this includes, without limitation, all social media platforms, the world wide web and any other advertising/marketing materials or in any media now or hereafter known. your first name, location, photographs and any language contained therein, may be used for public information without consideration or compensation. you further release builddirect, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries from any and all liability, claims or damages arising out of or relating to your submission. upon review, builddirect can and may, at their sole discretion, reject, remove or disallow inclusion of any and all submissions. customer service track your order shipping return policy faq contact us about builddirect welcome to builddirect who we are newsroom affiliates are you a contractor? careers resources learning center room scene submissions builddirect blog design center get inspired clean energy sellers supply chain follow us on 1-877-631-2845 customerservice@builddirect.com site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2017 privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2017
