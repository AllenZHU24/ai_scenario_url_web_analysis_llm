go to your “orders” tab in your profile to track your order. when will i receive my order? unfortunately, we cannot offer guarantees on standard order and container shipment timelines. most standard orders take 6-14 business days depending on how far the product has to travel to reach you. if the product is out of stock, however, wait time is approximately 6-8 weeks. container orders generally take 8-10 weeks from time payment is received. there is a chance that it may take longer because of factors beyond our control. for example, security measures undertaken by u.s. customs and border protection could possibly delay shipment of container orders. never miss the chance to improve your home! sign up to receive email updates on promotions, sales and more. subscribe facebook translation missing: en.general.social.links.linkedin instagram youtube twitter stay in touch 1-877-631-2845 (toll free in north america) customerservice@builddirect.com customer service my account track your order shipping return policy faq contact us about builddirect about us pro rewards careers investor relations & press resources learning center blog learn about financing ©2001-2024 builddirect privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy other policies choosing a selection results in a full page refresh. opens in a new window.
