notice and does not warrant that a product description or content on the site is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. 2.    builddirect makes all reasonable efforts to accurately display the colour, texture and detail of products on the site. builddirect however provides no guarantee that the colour, texture or detail you see matches that of the subject product. colour,

where builddirect is the seller of the product or (b) the manufacturer or supplier of the product where the manufacturer or supplier is the seller of the product on the pdp (in either case, the “list price”). for certain items that are offered as a set, the list price may represent the aggregate of manufacturer or supplier’s estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. 2.    for clarity, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these terms of sale, the list price does not include shipping and handling charges, customs, duties or any taxes applicable to your order. 3.    any strike-through or comparison price reflected on the site is either the price reported by the manufacturer or vendor to builddirect for the subject product or in some instances, is based on a comparative survey of the price of the same or a similar product being sold at representative retailers or department stores in relevant markets in the united states. for avoidance of doubt, the strike-through or comparison price may not be a price at which builddirect previously sold the product. the strike-through or comparison price may not always represent the actual price listed by retailers or department stores every day or in every community and builddirect does not certify the reliability or accuracy of any such information. for international sales, the comparison price is based on what such items would be sold at in the us market. strike-through or comparison prices are not a substitute for your own comparison shopping. if comparison prices are an
