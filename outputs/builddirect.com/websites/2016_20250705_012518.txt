a.the prices on our website are offered to anyone who meets our minimum order requirements. that means that if you are a homeowner, or a large construction company, builddirect’s prices are available to you when you buy in pallet and container quantities. q. i want to buy from builddirect. what are my options? a. builddirect is a wholesaler with proprietary internet technology and toll-free customer service to provide incredibly low prices on top quality building products. we process orders for building materials in two ways. the first is selling pallet multiples out of warehouses around north america. the second is shipping container orders directly from select manufacturers and delivered to your job site or distribution point of your choice. q. which forms of payment do you accept? a. we accept visa, mastercard, american express, paypal, and wire transfers. q. does builddirect ship worldwide? a. at present, we ship container orders (5000 sq. ft. +) worldwide. the options for shipping pallet quantities vary from product to product. consult the faqs by category for more details, or contact a builddirect sales rep toll-free or by email for more information. q. does builddirect ship to residences? how does that work? a.yes. a residential delivery is considered completed once the product is placed on the driveway. some products require a vehicle with a lift-gate, depending on weight. the pallets would be lowered to the ground and pulled onto your driveway with a pallet-jack. you may be required to unload the vehicle yourself, depending on the product. building materials are heavy and will require proper equipment or labour to accept goods on delivery. please check weight of goods before they are delivered so you are properly prepared. consult the faqs by category for the details on your product of interest, or call a builddirect sales rep for more information. q. when ordering containers, can i mix-and-match on colors and styles of material? a. for certain product lines, yes. consult the faqs by category for the details on your product of interest, or call a builddirect sales rep for more information q. i need a smaller amount of product than the minimum order. where do i go from here? a.please consult your local yellow pages for information on retailers that sell in smaller quantities. q. does builddirect install products or refer customers to installers? a.builddirect is not an installer, nor does builddirect refer or advocate any specific installation firms or individual installers. consult your local yellow pages for professionals in your area. q. do you offer any discounts to tradespeople? a. yes! builddirect’s bdpros rewards program gives tradespeople and contractors the opportunity to earn an annual rebate. as a bdpro, you’ll also receive a bonus if your sales go above $5,000, and an even larger bonus if they go above $50,000. this means you can earn up to $2,500 in rebates each year. click here for more information about how you can become a bdpro. q. may i see the product on the pallet before i buy? a. we are unable to show you the product at the warehouse. the warehouses we use are privately owned facilities and all products are in factory-sealed crates. we suggest ordering a sample and reviewing the graphics on the website. q. how do i obtain samples? a. samples can be ordered free online or over the phone at 1-877-631-2845. no credit card required. q. can you give me an exact arrival time for my order? a. unfortunately, we cannot offer guarantees on standard order and container shipment timelines. most standard orders take 6-14 business days depending on how far the product has to travel to reach you. if the product is out of stock, however, wait time is approximately 6-8 weeks. container orders generally take 8-10 weeks from time payment is received. there is a chance that it may take longer because of factors beyond our control. for example, security measures undertaken by u.s. customs and border protection could possibly delay shipment of container orders. q. how much should i allow for breakage/damage? a.it is reasonable to expect anywhere from 2%-10% breakage or damage, depending on the product. if breakage is above 10%, we would ask you to have it noted on the logistics receiving document and take pictures. please make a claim with us within 10 days of receiving the order. visit our company blog for interactive discussion with our experts, as well as articles and links which serve as valuable building materials information you’re looking for, visit our company blogs at www.blog.builddirect.com. feel free to read articles, make comments, and ask questions that will reveal the answers to questions about building materials to which others like you want to know the answers. talk to an expert!call: 1-877-631-2845 email: customerservice@builddirect.com related posts no related posts. categories select category old uncategorized flooring hardwood flooring laminate flooring ceramic & porcelain tile travertine tile wood flooring carpet & rugs bamboo flooring engineered hardwood flooring flooring accessories vinyl flooring slate tile cork flooring rubber flooring marble tile granite tile limestone tile outdoor decking outdoor furniture landscape outdoor accessories outdoor kitchens building materials siding panel products roofing kitchen & bath countertops wall tile & mosaics home improvement info resources the basics home decor bedroom decor energy efficiency doors exterior doors moldings & accessories moldings & trim lighting home decor storage & organization
