how do i obtain samples? can you give me an exact arrival time for my order? how much should i allow for breakage/damage? q. do i have to be a professional to buy from builddirect? a.the prices on our website are offered to anyone who meets our minimum order requirements. that means that if you are a homeowner, or a large construction company, builddirect's prices are available to you when you buy in pallet and container quantities. q. i want to buy from builddirect. what are my options? a. builddirect is a wholesaler with proprietary internet technology and toll-free customer service to provide incredibly low prices on top quality building products. we process orders for building materials in two ways. the first is selling pallet multiples out of warehouses around north america. the second is shipping container orders directly from select manufacturers and delivered to your job site or distribution point of your choice. q. which forms of payment do you accept? a. we accept visa, mastercard, american express, paypal, and wire transfers. q. does builddirect ship worldwide? a. at present, we ship container orders (5000 sq. ft. +) worldwide. the options for shipping pallet quantities vary from product to product. consult the faqs by category for more details, or contact a builddirect sales rep toll-free or by email for more information. q. does builddirect ship to residences? how does that work? a.yes. a residential delivery is considered completed once the product is placed on the driveway. some products require a vehicle with a lift-gate, depending on weight. the pallets would be lowered to the ground and pulled onto your driveway with a pallet-jack. you may be required to unload the vehicle yourself, depending on the product. building materials are heavy and will require proper equipment or labour to accept goods on delivery. please check weight of goods before they are delivered so you are properly prepared. consult the faqs by category for the details on your product of interest, or call a builddirect sales rep for more information. q. when ordering containers, can i mix-and-match on colors and styles of material? a. for certain product lines, yes. consult the faqs by category for the details on your product of interest, or call a builddirect sales rep for more information q. i need a smaller amount of product than the minimum order. where do i go from here? a.please consult your local yellow pages for information on retailers that sell in smaller quantities. q. does builddirect install products or refer customers to installers? a.builddirect is not an installer, nor does builddirect refer or advocate any specific installation firms or individual installers. consult your local yellow pages for professionals in your area. q. do you offer any discounts to tradespeople? a. the prices we show on our website are our best prices up front. if you can meet our minimum purchase requirements, we will sell to you regardless of whether you are in business or a private home owner. q. may i see the product on the pallet before i buy? a. we are unable to show you the product at the warehouse. the warehouses we use are privately owned facilities and all products are in factory-sealed crates. we suggest ordering a sample and reviewing the graphics on the website. q. how do i obtain samples? a. samples can be ordered free online or over the phone at 1-877-631-2845. no credit card required. q. can you give me an exact arrival time for my order? a. unfortunately, we cannot offer guarantees on container shipment timelines. at this time, most containers take 8-10 weeks from time payment is received. there is a chance that it may take longer because of factors beyond our control. for example, security measures undertaken by u.s. customs and border protection could possibly delay shipment. q. how much should i allow for breakage/damage? a.it is reasonable to expect anywhere from 2%-10% breakage or damage, depending on the product. if breakage is above 10%, we would ask you to have it noted on the logistics receiving document and take pictures. please make a claim with us within 10 days of receiving the order. visit our company blog for interactive discussion with our experts, as well as articles and links which serve as valuable building materials information you're looking for, visit our company blogs at www.blog.builddirect.com. feel free to read articles, make comments, and ask questions that will reveal the answers to questions about building materials to which others like you want to know the answers. customer service shipping return policy faq contact us about builddirect welcome to builddirect who we are newsroom affiliates careers resources learning center room scene submissions builddirect blog design center follow us on 1-877-631-2845 sales@builddirect.com site design by ©builddirect 2001 – 2015 privacy policy terms of use terms of sale environmental policy
