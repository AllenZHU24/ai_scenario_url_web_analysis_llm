your account will only be charged for the actual transaction amount when the first item on the order is shipped. any pending refunds will process when all items have shipped.most financial institutions will remove a pre-authorization hold from your account when the actual transaction amount is debited from your account or three to five business days after the pre-authorization request, whichever occurs sooner. since policies vary between different financial institutions, we recommend that you contact your financial institution with any further questions about a pre-authorization.
