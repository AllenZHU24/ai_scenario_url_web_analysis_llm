exactly what you will get before you place the order. shop now see my photos 1 2 3 4 5 6 for the best quality artwork, use the highest resolution your camera can handle. to put it simply, the higher the resolution, the larger you can print the image. if your resolution is too low, you will see a warning when you upload. black-and-white images add a lot of modern drama to the room. to really make the images pop, choose a canvas museum wrap, or a black frame and a white mat. the black frame creates a strong contrast while also complimenting the gray tones of your image. ever wonder what causes red eyes in photos? basically, the light from a flash is being reflected from the back of the eyeball! the good news is that most modern cameras have a quick setting to reduce red eye. think you only use a flash in the dark? guess again. when photographing in bright sunlight, you can turn on the flash of your camera to reduce the harshness of the shadows. as you decide where to hang your photo artwork, keep in mind that the optimum viewing distance for a framed print (or canvas wrap) is about twice the diagonal of the frame. want to capture your subject in mid-motion like the pros do? simply use a higher shutter speed and a higher iso setting to freeze the motion. a higher iso setting is also ideal for dimmer conditions, like cloudy days or indoor shots. art.com is committed to quality products and your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed! if for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return it within 30 days of receipt and receive a free replacement or a full refund for the price of the product. what makes our canvas prints so stunning? we follow the same giclée process that fine artists use to reproduce their original artwork. once we've printed your image on artist-grade canvas, it's stretched on wooden support bars and protected with a uv-coated finish. choose the style of canvas wrap that best suits your décor: museum wrap: your artwork is detailed with hand-painted black edges. the look is dramatic and modern. gallery wrap: your image is extended to cover the edges of the canvas. the look is polished yet informal. take note: your image will be cropped to fit the dimensions of the canvas size you choose. size price size price 8" x 10" $34.99 24" x 24" $119.99 8" x 24" $59.99 24" x 32" $149.99 11" x 14" $54.99 24" x

requirements for printing. this is probably because it was either taken on a camera that does not have enough megapixels, it was taken on a camera with the settings turned down, or the original file has been modified and the quality decreased. for best results, take your future photos at the highest resolution your camera will allow. minimum resolution requirements for our most popular sizes: size minimum dpi minimum optimal dpi optimal 8x10 125 1000x1250 250 2000x2500 11x14 125 1375x1750 250 2750x3500 16x20 100 1600x2000 250 4000x5000 16x24 100 1600x2400 250 4000x6000 18x24 100 1800x2400 250 4500x6000 20x30 100 2000x3000 250 5000x7000 24x32 100 2400x3200 250 6000x8000 24x36 100 2400x3600 250 6000x9000 for gallery wrap canvas, the minimum resolution required in more similar to the requirements for one size larger as the photo has to wrap around the edges of the canvas. for example, when creating an 8x10 gallery wrap canvas use the above guidelines for 11x14 instead. for all other products the above requirements are accurate. i received a warning saying “this size is not recommended for your image.” what are my options? we want you to be exceedingly happy with the quality of your photos to art product, so we limit the sizes at which you can print to those that will look the best. we warn you if we think there is a possibility that based on what we know about the image it might print with the high quality we want to deliver. you can still proceed, and the image when printed may come out just fine, but we want to be sure you're satisfied, so we're being cautious for some of the larger sizes where the quality of your image could affect the results. size selectionwhy don't i see all available sizes in the size drop down? in an effort to maintain the aspect ratio of the photo you uploaded, we filter available sizes based on the aspect ratio or your photo. in all instances, regardless of photo aspect ratio, we also include 8x10 and 11x14, due to their popularity. to select an alternative size that is based on a different aspect ratio, simply select “see more sizes” from the finished size drop down menu. if you do not see “see more sizes” as an option, it means that the resolution of your photo is insufficient to print in a larger size that those already shown in the drop down menu. image croppinghow do i reposition or crop my photo?  if the size you have selected does not match the aspect ratio of your photo, then you can reposition your photo image. click on “change print area” and a module will open that will allow you to adjust what part of your photo is included in the printable area. we only allow for vertical adjustments on portrait photos and horizontal adjustments on landscape photos. for more complex cropping capabilities we suggest you use a photo editing tool prior to uploading your image to our photos to art service. if the “change print area” button is not enabled, it means that the selected size exactly matches the aspect ratio of your photo and that the entire image is being shown in the printable area. therefore there is no “extra” photo to crop out. image content guidelineswhat images can i upload to photos to art? you may upload photos that are formatted as either jpeg or tiff files. we cannot process other photo format at this time. you can upload photos ranging from a minimum size of 500kb up to 20mb.
