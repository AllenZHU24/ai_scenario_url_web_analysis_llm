van gogh (1853 – 1890) is regarded as one of the most profoundly influential artists of the 19th century, though was not commercially successful during his life. in 1880, van gogh moved from belgium to live with his brother in brussels and become a self-taught artist. a prolific painter, van gogh produced all of his over 2,100 artworks during a 10-year period. he struggled with mental illness and created many of his masterpieces while institutionalized. he gained critical and commercial success decades after his death by suicide and today van gogh's artworks are among the world's most
