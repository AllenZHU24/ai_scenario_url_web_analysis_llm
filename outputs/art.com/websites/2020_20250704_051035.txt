prior to shipping, we have only received a pending pre-authorization request from your financial institution. when we request an authorization for your purchase, your financial institution may place a hold on your account for the amount of that pre-authorization request. while your financial institution may place a hold on the pre-authorized amount, your account will only be charged for the actual transaction amount when the first item on the order is shipped. any pending refunds will process when all items have shipped. most financial institutions will remove a pre-authorization hold from your account when the actual transaction amount is debited from your account or 3-5 business days after the pre-authorization request, whichever occurs sooner. since policies vary between different financial institutions, we recommend that you contact your financial institution with any further questions about a pre-authorization. art.com will not release pre-authorization holds. how do i find a specific item from your catalog?
