we combine similar items in one shipment subject to the processing times of all items in the shipment (see processing & delivery times). if an unexpected delay should occur that prevents available items on your order from shipping when expected, you may specifically request that the available items be shipped separately. contact our customer support team directly by email. can i ship to a p.o. box?

prior to shipping, we have only received a pending pre-authorization request from your financial institution. when we request an authorization for your purchase, your financial institution may place a hold on your account for the amount of that pre-authorization request. while your financial institution may place a hold on the pre-authorized amount, your account will only be charged for the actual transaction amount when the first item on the order is shipped. any pending refunds will process when all items have shipped. most financial institutions will remove a pre-authorization hold from your account when the actual transaction amount is debited from your account or 3-5 business days after the pre-authorization request, whichever occurs sooner. since policies vary between different financial institutions, we recommend that you contact your financial institution with any further questions about a pre-authorization. art.com will not release pre-authorization holds. how do i find a specific item from your catalog? enter the exact name of the artwork or the catalog item number into the search box that appears at the top of each page. does the image on your site accurately represent what i will be sent? we strive for a high degree of image accuracy. however, in some cases, the visual representation may be approximate, or prints may vary. if you are not satisfied with the product you receive, you may return it within 45 days for a refund. how accurate are the item dimensions listed on your web pages? art.com verifies the dimensions of all images on our site, but due to industry standards sizes can vary slightly up to (1½"). if you are not satisfied with the product you receive, you may return it within 45 days for a refund. gift certificates how do i buy a gift certificate?
