in order to offer you the lowest shipping rates, we combine similar items in one shipment subject to the processing times of all items in the shipment (see processing & delivery times). if an unexpected delay should occur that prevents available items on your order from shipping when expected, you may specifically request that the available items be shipped separately. this will not affect your shipping charges, but you must contact our customer support team directly by email or by calling us at 800-952-5592. can i ship to a p.o. box? yes, within certain guidelines. the usps delivers packages 11" x 14" and smaller to a p.o. box. larger items must be shipped to a street address. we can also ship to an apo through the usps. returns what is your return policy? choose from two ways to return: expedite photo returns we are committed to quality products and your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. if for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return it within 30 days of receipt and receive a free replacement or a full refund for the price of the product. shipping charges will not be refunded. if your order arrives in less than satisfactory condition we offer a hassle-free photo return option to speed replacement. here's how: take a digital photo of your damaged product and the shipping container it arrived in (only if the package is also damaged). attach your photos to an email and send them to returns@art.com. please include your order number, shipping id or item number, a brief description of the reason for the return, and whether you'd like a replacement or a refund. you will receive an email within 24-48 hours confirming that your photo return is being processed. if your photo return is confirmed, you do not need to mail back your order. we will process the refund or replacement based on your photos. please note: photo returns are accepted for most posters and art prints, including framed items, canvas, acrylic, and wood mounts. photo returns are not available for some items, including tapestries, rugs, hand painted art, and limited edition prints. if the damage or quality issue is not apparent in the photo, you may be required to return the item at your expense before the return can be processed regular returns we invite you to return your order for a full refund of the product cost (minus shipping charges) by following these simple steps: complete the return instructions form on the back of the packing ship included with your order. ship your item back to us in its original packaging and enclose your completed return request. we strongly encourage you to return the item via a trackable method.returns addressart.com returns4000 creekside parkway, unit clockbourne, oh 43194 we will typically issue your refund within 48-72 hours of receiving the package. ordering how do i place an order?

prior to shipping, we have only received a pending pre-authorization request from your financial institution. when we request an authorization for your purchase, your financial institution may place a hold on your account for the amount of that pre-authorization request. while your financial institution may place a hold on the pre-authorized amount, your account will only be charged for the actual transaction amount when the first item on the order is shipped. any pending refunds will process when all items have shipped. most financial institutions will remove a pre-authorization hold from your account when the actual transaction amount is debited from your account or 3-5 business days after the pre-authorization request, whichever occurs sooner. since policies vary between different financial institutions, we recommend that you contact your financial institution with any further questions about a pre-authorization. art.com will not release pre-authorization holds. how do i find a specific item from your catalog? enter the exact name of the artwork or the catalog item number into the search box that appears at the top of each page. does the image on your site accurately represent what i will be sent? we strive for a high degree of image accuracy. however, in some cases, the visual representation may be approximate, or prints may vary. if you are not satisfied with the product you receive, you may return it within 30 days for a refund. how accurate are the item dimensions listed on your web pages? art.com verifies the dimensions of all images on our site, but due to industry standards sizes can vary slightly up to (1½"). if you are not satisfied with the product you receive, you may return it within 30 days for a refund. does art.com offer a military discount? yes! art.com offers a 35% discount to u.s. military members as a way of saying "thank you" for your service. in order to qualify for the offer, we do require verification of your military affiliation through our partner sheerid. after being successfully verified, you will be issued a 35% off discount code to be used at checkout for any purchase over $30. gift certificates how do i buy a gift certificate?
