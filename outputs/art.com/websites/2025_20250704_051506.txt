i chose the 23x29 inch size with the chelsea black frame. two things that set this apart from other sites and #1 the anti-glare coating (super important!) and #2 the pricing (which is the best i've found). the wait wasn't too bad, it was in perfect condition and it looks exactly as it did on my screen (both in quality and color). i'm super happy with the purchase.alisa c.fabulousi bought this picture a few weeks ago in a very large size. i was so nervous it was going to look blurry, but it's amazing. highly recommended.joseph n.great framing job!this picture looks great! it's going to be a nice addition to my gallery wall. the reproduction of van gogh's artwork is top-notch!jean w.beautiful artwork!i am so glad that i bought this piece of art. excellent quality and it is perfect for my mountain home.karen d.vibrant colors, stunning!i'm in love with this piece!
