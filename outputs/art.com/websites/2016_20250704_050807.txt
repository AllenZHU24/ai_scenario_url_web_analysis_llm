protect your walls. view sizes & prices get started see my photos quick tips for the best quality artwork, use the highest resolution your camera can handle. the higher the resolution, the larger you can print your image. don't worry, if your resolution is too low we'll let you know. a black and white image will add modern drama to your room. to really make the image pop, choose a canvas museum wrap or a black frame and a white mat. the black frame creates a strong contrast while also complimenting the gray tones of your image. ever wonder what causes red eyes in photos? basically, the light from a flash is being reflected from the back of the eyeball! the good news is that most modern cameras have a quick setting to reduce red eye. think you only use a flash in the dark? guess again. when photographing in bright sunlight, you can turn on the flash of your camera to reduce the harshness of the shadows. as you decide where to hang your photo artwork, keep in mind that the optimum viewing distance is about twice the diagonal length of the art. want to capture your subject in mid-motion like the pros do? simply use a higher shutter speed and a higher iso setting to freeze the motion. a higher iso setting is also ideal for dimmer conditions, like cloudy days or indoor shots. 100% satisfaction guaranteed art.com is committed to quality products and your satisfaction is 100%
