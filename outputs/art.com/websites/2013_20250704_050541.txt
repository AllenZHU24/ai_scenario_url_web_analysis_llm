basically, the light from a flash is being reflected from the back of the eyeball! the good news is that most modern cameras have a quick setting to reduce red eye. think you only use a flash in the dark? guess again. when photographing in bright sunlight, you can turn on the flash of your camera to reduce the harshness of the shadows. as you decide where to hang your photo artwork, keep in mind that the optimum viewing distance is about twice the diagonal length of the art. want to capture your subject in mid-motion like the pros do? simply use a higher shutter speed and a higher iso setting to freeze the motion. a higher iso setting is also ideal for dimmer conditions, like cloudy days or indoor shots. 100% satisfaction guaranteed art.com is committed to quality products and your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed! if for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return it within 30 days of receipt and receive a free replacement or a full refund for the price of the product. order toll free 800-952-5592 customer service contact us ordering shipping & delivery returns international orders gift certificates faqs my account access my account track my order about art.com our company careers artist rising business & trade sales affiliate program shop our catalog sign up for art.com email updates enter email address please enter a valid email address follow us © art.com inc. all rights reserved. | privacy policy | terms of use | terms of sale art.com, you+art, and photos [to] art are trademarks or registered trademarks of art.com inc. various aspects of this website are covered by issued us patent no. 7,973,796 and other pending patent applications.
