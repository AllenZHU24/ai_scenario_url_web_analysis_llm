art.com guarantees your satisfaction 100%. on the rare chance that your package is lost or damaged upon arrival, just contact our customer support team. what happens if only part of my order is ready to ship? because we’re mindful of resources and carbon footprint, we combine multiple items in an order into one shipment. if an item is temporarily out of stock or on backorder, we may hold the rest of your items if we expect the item to be restocked soon. as soon as it arrives in our warehouse, we’ll ship your entire order to you in one shipment. if your shipment is delayed due to a backordered item, you can request that we send the rest of your order. this won’t affect shipping charges, but please contact our customer support team directly to request this. can i ship to a p.o. box? the usps delivers packages 11" x 14" and smaller to a p.o. box. larger items must be shipped to a street address. we can also ship to an apo through the usps. help customer service overview contact us ordering shipping & delivery returns international orders gift certificates faqs my account access my account track my order our products product types framing & other services corporate policies privacy policy terms of use terms of sale content policy our ads cookies photos to art terms of use art.com logo life is better with art. world's largest selection of art we have millions of prints, in a wide variety of styles. but more importantly, we’ll help you find just the right one. find the perfect frame over 200 handcrafted frames, plus canvas, wood mount, and more. all at around 40% less than a custom frame shop. your walls are waiting we can match you up with art you’ll love, help create a home gallery, and even provide assistance getting it on the wall. customer service contact us ordering shipping & delivery returns gift cards faqs business sales workspaceart division about art.com our company careers shop our catalog do not sell my personal information request personal information my account access my account track my order sign up for exclusive offers and inspiration please enter a valid email address follow us facebook instagram twitter © art.com all rights reserved. privacy policy | terms and conditions art.com is a registered trademark of art.com inc. various aspects of this website are covered by issued us patent no. 7,973,796 and other pending patent applications. mcafee secure better business bureau
