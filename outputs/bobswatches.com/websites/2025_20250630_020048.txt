thrilled with my new (2013) gmt master. i can't imagine buying a used rolex (you can't buy a new one if you are an average guy) from anyone else but bob's. i highly recommend them and wes." review originally published on trustpilot barbara d. "first purchase of a rolex, & an expensive watch. did research & found bob's watches to be a reputable online option. reps were helpful answering questions & providing assistance. i was having technical problems with online order & rep assisted over the phone. required add'l prodding on my part to get order uploaded to my online acct, but it worked out. watch band was supposed to be sized before shipment, that did not happen, but i was able to remove links, so it ended up also working out.watch was in better condition than described, thrilled over the moon with purchase." review originally published on trustpilot todd k.
