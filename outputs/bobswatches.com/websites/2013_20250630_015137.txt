what types of rolex watch crystals are there? what are considered "jewels" in a rolex? frequently asked questions why are there two prices for each watch? the two prices listed with each watch are a "buy it" and "sell it" price. the "buy it" price is how much you can buy it for and the "sell it" price is how much you can sell it to us for. how does shipping work? we offer free fedex next day insured shipping. there are no extra charges for shipping and we will ship your watch soon after your order is processed. to protect your watch we deliver your watch to the nearest fedex location where you can pick it up and sign for it (if there are no fedex locations near you we can make exceptions) can i sell other types of watches on the website? yes, we buy certain other types of watches on the site. please give us a call or fill out the "sell your watch" form to give us information about your watch. why do some watches have bigger gaps between their buy and sell prices than others? particular watches are less popular than others and happen to leave our shelves less quickly. these watches have the biggest difference between the buy and sell prices because we have to hold them longer to sell them. the more popular models have much smaller differences because we get them in and out of our store quickly. is this site secure? bob's watches is protected by a 256 bit ssl (secure socket layer) so your information is completely secure. also we will never sell or distribute your information to anyone. how do i know the watch i buy from your site is real?

we offer payment by credit card through discover, visa, and mastercard as well as payment by wire transfer. do you ship internationally? we do ship internationally, but we currently accept only wire transfer payments for international purchases. if you are an international buyer and wish to purchase or sell a watch please call us at 1(800) 494-3708 or  and we'd be happy to help you. what types of rolex watch movements are available? there are 3 main types of movements on rolex watches. manual wind - manual wind watches need to be wound on a daily basis in order to run and accurately display time. this movement can be found on many classic or simplistic rolex models such as the men's cellini. automatic or self-winding - the is the most common type of movement found in rolex watches today. this movement involves a rotor which transfers power to the mainspring and keeps the watch powered by the kinetic motion of your wrist while you wear it. if the rolex is worn daily, the rotor should produce enough power for the watch to run without manual winding needed. quartz - the quartz movement is arguably the most precise out of the 3 types being powered by a battery, a much more reliable method. it needs very minor maintenance except for the periodic battery change. this movement became popular in the 1970s and can be found in many ladies cellini models today. what do the water resistance ratings mean? the water resistance of a rolex is usually measured in meters and defines how deep it can go underwater while keeping water from getting in the watch. this rating is not completely precise as it is measured under the condition that both watch and water are motionless. however, this is rarely the case in reality because neither the wearer nor the water will ever be still, which increases the level of pressure on the rolex and therefore, the chance of water entering the watch. the list below shows all the available water resistance ratings and their most applicable conditions. "water resistance" or 30 meters - water splashes and light rain 50 meters - brief submergence in water 100 meters - snorkeling and swimming pools 200 meters - shallow scuba diving 300 meters - deep scuba diving 1,000 meters or more - about 3/5 of a mile and is more water pressure than a human body can withstand avoid extended periods of time in hot water as the heat can potentially warp the gaskets which keep the water from getting in. moving from extremely hot to cold conditions can also deform the metals within the watch. the watch should generally be kept off during baths and showers as soap can decrease the gaskets' surface tension and damage the seal. what is the difference between chronograph and chronometer? a chronograph refers to watches with stopwatch functionality and typically refers to the daytona model when talking about rolex. chronograph daytonas will have two to three additional subdials or registers on the face of the watch and corresponding pushers to control them. these types of rolex watches are usually popular with those active in sports and racing where keeping time is often useful. the chronometer is a watch that has gone through extensive testing and ensured to meet certain precision standards. for swiss watches such as rolex, all watches given the "chronometer" label has been certified by the cosc, the official swiss chronometer testing institute, after severely testing the accuracy of the movement for 15 days, across multiple positions and temperatures. for mechanical watches such as 99% of rolex, they must be within -4 and +6 seconds off after the testing period in order to pass. what types of rolex watch crystals are there? there are two types of crystals used by rolex. acrylic - found in older vintage rolex models, these crystals scratch easily but are easy to buff or replace because they are inexpensive. sapphire - these crystals are scratch resistant and cannot be scratched by any material except diamond and minerals with a hardness rating of 10. however, they are much more expensive, more likely to shatter on heavy impact, and if scratches do occur, they cannot be buffed out. what are considered "jewels" in a rolex? jewels are generally artificial synthetic rubies or saphhires that have been polished to server as bearings and stones for the gears and pallet-arms within a watch. these jewels, along with frequent, regular maintenance can reduce the friction between mechanical parts within the watch and drastically extend its lifepsan. in general, the more jewels a watch has, the more precise it is considered, but this is not always true. select a modelrolex submarinerrolex daytonarolex presidentrolex datejustrolex daterolex gmt-mastervintage rolexrolex milgaussrolex explorerrolex air-kingrolex sea-dwellerrolex yachtmasterrolex celliniladies used rolexprice guiderolex booksused rolexmens used rolexjewelry company info authenticity pledge buyers protection plan about bob's customer testimonials press bob's rolex usa services & support find it for me terms & conditions privacy policy contact us faq resources buying & selling how to sell used rolex prices pre-owned rolex rolex serial numbers shipping & returns u.s. shipping international shipping returns shipping info connect with us twitter facebook careers at bob's blog site map site map copyright bob's watches. all rights reserved. bob's watches is not affiliated with rolex s.a., rolex usa, or any of its subsidiaries. bob's watches is an independent watch dealer and is not sponsored by, associated with and/or affiliated with rolex, s.a. bob's watches sells pre-owned rolex watches and provides its own warranties on the watches it sells. rolex, www.rolex.com, is under no obligation to warranty-service watches sold by bob's watches. rolex datejust, rolex day date president, submariner, presidential, explorer, sea dweller, super president, gmt master, gmt, yachtmaster, prince, milgaus, masterpiece, air king, cosmograph daytona, and pearlmaster are all registered trademarks of the rolex corporation ( rolex usa, rolex s.a.) to buy a new rolex watch, please visit rolex.com for a list of authorized rolex dealers near you. win a rolex submariner rolex submariner stainless early product notifications special promos & offers input your email to enter you've been entered! click follow or like to improve your chance of winning! win a rolex scroll to top
