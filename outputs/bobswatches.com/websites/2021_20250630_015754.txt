models        key features        questions about rolex watches for women when searching for luxury watches for women, there is no better brand than rolex. built to the highest possible standards and constructed from only the very best materials, rolex watches for women are built to last a lifetime. these iconic timepieces are celebrated throughout the world for their refined and feminine designs, and they exude style, professionalism, and a classic yet fashionable aesthetic that is always on-trend. furthermore, unlike luxury watches for women from other brands, which typically run on battery-operated quartz movements and offer lower water-resistance ratings, rolex ladies' watches are powered by chronometer-certified automatic mechanical movements and provide optimal water-resistance - just like the men's models. simply put, there are no shortcuts when it comes to women's rolex watches. our industry-leading selection of pre-owned ladies rolex watches ensures that there is something for everyone. how much is a ladies rolex? model retail price second-hand price size material oyster perpetual 5,000 usd from $2,695 31mm stainless steel lady-datejust president

watch, and the presence of diamonds or other precious gemstones can also significantly impact resale value, both at retail and on the secondary market. at retail, the cheapest ladies’ rolex watch is the oyster perpetual 26 in full stainless steel, priced at $4,850. however, it is not uncommon to find pre-owned ladies' rolex watches in the $2,000 to $3,000 range, especially for older models from collections such as the datejust and oyster perpetual. ladies rolex watch models rolex ladies' datejust models the rolex lady-datejust is easily one of the most recognizable timepieces in the world. designed as a modern timepiece with traditional charm, this aesthetically pleasing wristwatch is a keeper for anyone looking to start or expand their collection. some of the new modern and used vintage references include the following: 178273 69178 69008 6827 69278 168623 68623 69623 69178 69008 6827 69278 68273 rolex first introduced the lady-datejust in 1957 as a smaller and more feminine edition of the men's datejust watch that had debuted over a decade earlier in 1945. following in the footsteps of its predecessor, the rolex lady-datejust included a waterproof case, a fluted bezel, a date window at 3 o'clock magnified by a cyclops lens, and an automatic movement inside the watch. since then, women's rolex datejust watches went on to become some of the best-selling models (some say the highest-selling) in the brand's entire catalog. it's important to note that the lady-datejust is a sub-collection within the greater datejust line-up. for decades, rolex offered the lady-datejust with a 26mm case. however, in 2015, rolex phased out the 26mm case and replaced it with a slightly larger 28mm case. along with the rolex lady-datejust models, the mid-size datejust 31 is typically classified as a women's rolex watch too. additionally, there are plenty of women who opt to wear the datejust 36 (which has traditionally been marketed to men). remember that irrespective of the size, all rolex datejust watches provide the same fundamental design functionality across all models. for those looking to shop by dress watches be sure to browse our womens rolex dress watches page. popular rolex datejust models for women: lady-datejust 26 (discontinued) lady-datejust 28 datejust 31 datejust 36 the lady-datejust 26, lady-datejust 28, and datejust 31 watches are the only rolex models outside of the day-date collection that offer the option of the famous president bracelet. as a result, these models are often referred to as the rolex lady-president watches and are exclusively crafted from precious metals (either solid 18k gold or 950 platinum). rolex datejust watches for women are available in a wide assortment of styles. material options include stainless steel, full 18k gold (yellow, white, and everose gold), two-tone steel and gold, and even solid platinum. bracelet styles include the sporty three-link oyster, the dressy five-link jubilee, and the ultra-luxurious three-link president. bezels can range from simple domed and fluted to lavish gem-set, providing buyers with an immense range of options. there are also the various diamond rolex datejust watches for women, with gem-setting options on bezels, cases, dials, bracelets, or all of the above. the rolex lady-datejust is a true icon among women's watches and one of the most famous ladies models of all time. the combination of a classic rolex watch design coupled with countless variations to cater to all different tastes has allowed the datejust to become one of the most popular ladies’ luxury watches ever made. rolex ladies' date models in addition to the datejust, rolex also makes the date watch, featuring an identical dial layout with a trio of hands at the center for timekeeping and a date window at 3 o'clock. in the past, rolex used to offer three sizes of the date watch: the ladies' date with a 26mm case, the midsize date with a 31mm case, and the men’s date with a 34mm case. there were also numerous variations in regards to materials, bezels, and dials. today, however, rolex only makes the date with a 34mm case and an oyster bracelet. material choices include a full stainless steel model with a smooth bezel or a stainless steel model topped with an 18k white gold fluted bezel (white rolesor). the current-production rolex date watches are ideally sized for both men and women, and they are a popular option for those looking for understated rolex watches. rolex ladies' oyster perpetual models for a simpler take on a classic rolex watch, there are the ladies' oyster perpetual watches, characterized by time-only dials and self-winding automatic movements. while there are two-tone (steel and gold) and full gold vintage versions of the ladies' oyster perpetual, today’s models are exclusively made from stainless steel. current-production rolex oyster perpetual watches are available in a range of sizes, all fitted with stainless steel cases that are water-resistant to 100 meters, smooth bezels, stainless steel oyster bracelets, and cosc-certified automatic movements. the three-hander op dials come in an assortment of colors from classic neutral shades to vibrant shades of blue, pink, and purple. popular oyster perpetual models for women: oyster perpetual 26 oyster perpetual 31 oyster perpetual 34 oyster perpetual 26 rolex ladies' yacht-master models the yacht-master collection is the only rolex sports watch collection with models designed specifically for women. originally launched in the early 1990s, the nautical-inspired rolex yacht-master features 100-meter water resistant oyster cases, bidirectional rotating timing bezels graduated to 60-minutes, and dials with a date window at rolex's signature 3 o'clock location. during the first two decades of the rolex yacht-master's history, there were three sizes available, 40mm, 35mm, and 29mm - with the latter two typically marketed towards women. all the watches came with oyster bracelets. the ladies' 29mm and midsize 35mm yacht-master watches were offered in full yellow gold, two-tone yellow gold and steel, and a combination of stainless steel and platinum that rolex calls rolesium. there were also a handful of gem-set dials to choose from with diamonds, sapphires, and rubies serving as hour markers. in the mid-2010s, rolex updated the yacht-master collection. first, the brand discontinued the 29mm and 35mm editions and replaced it with the yacht-master 37 for women. second, rolex no longer makes yacht-master models in yellow gold or two-tone yellow gold and stainless steel. instead, rolex added everose gold versions (the brand's proprietary rose gold alloy) to the lineup including a yacht-master 37 in everose gold with a black oysterflex bracelet (the brand's proprietary rubber strap with an interior metal blade) as well as a two-tone everose gold and steel yacht-master 37 with a matching oyster bracelet. there are also rolesium versions of the ladies' yacht-master 37 model available, which feature stainless steel cases with solid platinum bezels. popular yacht-master models for women: yacht-master 29 in yellow gold, two-tone yellow gold and steel, and rolesium (discontinued) yacht-master 35 in yellow gold, two-tone yellow gold and steel, and rolesium (discontinued) yacht-master 37 in everose gold, two-tone everose gold and steel, and rolesium rolex ladies' pearlmaster models in 1992, rolex unveiled a new watch model specifically for ladies dubbed the pearlmaster. billed as a jewelry watch collection, rolex pearlmaster models are exclusively fashioned from either 18k gold or platinum and always include diamonds. it's worth mentioning that the dials of rolex pearlmaster watches have "datejust" written on them since they have a date window at 3 o'clock. however, this particular ladies' rolex watch model takes its name from the pearlmaster bracelet, characterized by rounded five-piece links, which is exclusively fitted to rolex's jewelry-oriented collection of watches. while rolex previously offered 29mm versions of the pearlmaster women's watch, those have been discontinued in favor of pearlmaster 34 and pearlmaster 39 models. with that in mind, the 29mm version still remains incredibly popular among women on the secondary market. rolex ladies' day-date models since its inception in 1956 as the first watch to include the date and the day written out in full on the dial, rolex has marketed the day-date watch primarily to male customers. however, this has certainly not stopped women from wearing the famed day-date president watch. the 36mm size of the watch is perfectly suited to many women's wrists and the prestigious appeal of the day-date is universal, regardless of gender. no doubt rolex noticed this long-established trend and at baselworld 2019, the brand unveiled some new day-date 36 models with plenty of feminine design touches such as colorful dials and generous gem-setting treatments. although rolex never explicitly stated that these are ladies’ day-date watches, the designs speak for themselves and there are unquestionably plenty of women that opt for the day-date as their go-to ladies' rolex watch. rolex ladies' daytona models similarly, the daytona chronograph was first designed as a man’s watch and is currently only offered with a case diameter of 40mm. however, in the 2000s, rolex introduced a line of white gold daytona watches with colorful dials and matching exotic leather straps, directly marketed towards women. nicknamed the rolex daytona "beach" watches, these vibrant models were offered in pink, yellow, turquoise, and green colorways. aside from these now-discontinued special edition models, rolex daytona chronographs in general, whether in steel, gold, or two-tone, are a popular choice for women who want a sporty luxury watch, and rolex still offers a number of different daytona models that are aimed specifically at women. ladies rolex key features ladies rolex watch materials rolex watches for women are available in a range of different metals. current-production models use the following materials.

watches? in general, the only difference between men’s and ladies’ rolex watches is the size. women’s models typically have smaller cases and slimmer bracelets. other than that, rolex watches for men and women in the datejust, date, oyster perpetual, and yacht-master collections offer the same exact functionality. what is the cheapest ladies’ rolex watch? the cheapest ladies’ rolex watch is the oyster perpetual 26 in full stainless steel. while the current-production versions of the ladies’ op 26 are priced over $4,000 at retail, similar pre-owned versions can be picked up at a significant discount on the secondary market. are ladies’ rolex watches mechanical or quartz? while rolex previously manufactured quartz watches and manual-winding models, all of the watches that rolex manufactures today run on chronometer-certified (cosc) in-house made automatic movements - including ladies’ watches. however, when shopping for pre-owned rolex watches, you may come across some quartz-powered ladies’ watches from older rolex cellini models. there are also some vintage rolex cocktail watches that run on manual-winding movements. do all ladies’ rolex watches have diamonds? although many rolex watches for women have diamond embellishments on their cases, dials, bezels, and bracelets, there are also plenty of models that do not. only pearlmaster watches always include diamonds, while other rolex collections offer the option of diamonds. are there vintage rolex watches for women? yes, absolutely! rolex has been making watches for women ever since the company was founded in 1905. therefore, there are plenty of ladies’ vintage rolex watches available in a wide variety of materials and styles.
