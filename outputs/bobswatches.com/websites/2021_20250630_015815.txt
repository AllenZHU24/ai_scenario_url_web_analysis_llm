although the gold and two-tone versions aren't far behind. while the automatic steel daytona watches were equipped with metal bezels since their launch in 1988, in 2016 that all changed when rolex switched to a black cerachrom bezel. the following graph shows the retail price increase of the stainless steel daytona, which covers the following references: daytona ref. 116520 (2000 – 2016) daytona ref. 116500 (2016 – present) stainless steel daytona price of all the rolex watches, it's the daytona that commands the highest premiums on the secondary market - more than double retail. here are the 2021 prices for used steel daytona references: pre-owned daytona 116520 price: starting at $18,995 pre-owned daytona 116500 price: starting at $26,595 rolex explorer prices: retail vs. used with its steel construction and time-only dial, the explorer is positioned as one of rolex's most affordable and understated sports watch models. the past few years have seen an incredible demand increase for the explorer - both for the older 36mm model and the newer 39mm model, thereby driving up its market price. the below graph tracks the rise in the rolex explorer msrp, covering the following references: explorer ref. 114270 (2001 – 2010) explorer ref. 214270 mk i (2010 – 2016) explorer ref. 214270 mk ii (2016 – present) explorer price while rolex has maintained the explorer retail price over the last decade, the demand for this watch has driven the prices up for pre-owned models above retail prices. here are the 2021 prices for used explorer watches: pre-owned explorer 14720 price: starting at $6,000 pre-owned explorer 214720 mk i price: starting at $7,295 pre-owned explorer 214720 mk ii price: starting at $8,195 rolex explorer ii prices: retail vs. used the younger, bigger, and more complicated brother of the explorer, the explorer ii benefits from the addition of gmt and date functionalities. like many other rolex sports watch models, the explorer ii underwent a size increase, growing from 40mm to 42mm in 2011. the following graph shows the rise in the explorer ii retail price, covering the following references: explorer ii ref. 16570 (1989-2011) explorer ii ref. 216570 (2011 – present) explorer ii price it wasn't that long ago that the explorer ii was frequently dubbed the most underrated rolex sports watch in the market with pre-owned prices reliably much less than retail prices. the story has significantly changed over the last couple of years and as of 2021, these are the prices for pre-owned rolex explorer ii watches: pre-owned explorer ii 16570 price: starting at $7,195 pre-owned explorer ii 216570 price: starting at $8,495 rolex sea-dweller and deepsea prices: retail vs. used the sea-dweller and the deepsea are rolex's most robust and capable dive watches, with the former boasting a water-resistance rating of 1,200 meters and the latter an incredible rating of 3,900 meters! the sea-dweller has been around since 1967 while the deepsea is much newer, having made its debut in 2008. below are charts depicting the msrp increase of the sea-dweller and the deepsea, covering the following references: rolex sea-dweller prices: sea-dweller ref. 16600 (1989 – 2009) sea-dweller ref. 116600 (2014–2017) sea-dweller ref. 126600 (2017 – present) rolex deepsea prices: deepsea ref. 116660 (2008 – 2018) deepsea ref. 116660 d blue (2014 – 2018) deepsea ref. 126660 (2018 – present) deepsea ref. 126660 d-blue (2018 – present) sea-dweller price deepsea price similar to the popularity of the submariner, these two dive watches have also always enjoyed healthy resale prices. however, the last handful of years has witnessed sharp increases in resale value. in 2021, these are the prices for pre-owned sea-dweller and deepsea watches: rolex sea-dweller pre-owned prices: pre-owned sea-dweller 16600 price: starting at $8,295 pre-owned sea-dweller 116600 price: starting at $13,995 pre-owned sea-dweller ref. 126600 price: starting at $14,595 rolex deepsea pre-owned prices: pre-owned deepsea ref. 116660 price: starting at $12,495 pre-owned deepsea ref. 116660 d blue price: starting at $13,495 pre-owned deepsea ref. 126660 price: $12,995 pre-owned deepsea ref. 126660 d-blue price: starting at $15,495 rolex yacht-master prices: retail vs. used rolex introduced the yacht-master nautical watch in 1992, similar in many ways to the submariner but more luxurious in its execution. the yacht-master's higher price point reflects the watch's ample use of precious metals. below is a graph charting the rise of msrp of the popular stainless steel and platinum yacht-master 40, covering the following references: yacht-master 40 ref. 16622 (1999 – 2012) yacht-master 40 ref. 116622 (2012 – 2019) yacht-master 40 ref. 126622 (2019 – present) stainless steel & platinum yacht-master 40 price yet again, we see that the overall demand for rolex sports watches, including the yacht-master, is causing pre-owned prices to escalate at a rapid rate. it was once easier to find a used yacht-master well below retail; however, as of early 2021, expect to pay these prices for pre-owned references: pre-owned yacht-master 40 16622 price: starting at $7,995 pre-owned yacht-master 40 116622 price: starting at $12,995 pre-owned yacht-master 40 126622 price: starting at $13,995 rolex yacht-master ii prices: retail vs. used released in 2007 as a 44mm model equipped with a regatta chronograph, the yacht-master ii is one of rolex's newest, largest, most complicated, and priciest sports watches. while it was initially only available in precious metals, in 2013, rolex launched the stainless steel yacht-master ii. as the chart below illustrates, rolex has not increased the steel yacht-master ii msrp significantly over the last decade. yacht-master ii ref. 116680 mark i (2013 - 2017) yacht-master ii ref. 116680 mark ii (2017 - present) stainless steel yacht-master ii price it's no secret that the yacht-master ii's bold style and niche complication is a polarizing offering within rolex enthusiasts. as such, it hasn't yet gained the type of mass popularity as other rolex sports watches and as of early 2021, fans of this regatta chronograph can still take advantage of below-retail prices for a used steel yacht-master ii. pre-owned yacht-master ii ref. 116680 price: starting at $15,995 rolex milgauss prices: retail vs. used although the antimagnetic milgauss watch was first created in the mid-1950s to serve the burgeoning scientific community, rolex discontinued it in 1988. however, in 2007, the milgauss made its return in a modern form with a 40mm steel case. buyers could choose between the milgauss ref. 116400 with a traditional clear sapphire crystal and the futuristic-looking milgauss ref. 116400gv with a green-tinted sapphire crystal. as of 2016, rolex only produces the green "gv" version and the below plot depicts the increase of both milgauss reference retail prices since their introduction. milgauss ref. 116400 (2007 - 2016) milgauss ref. 116400gv (2007 - present) milgauss price the milgauss is one of the very few sportier 40mm steel rolex watches that can currently be found in the secondary market at prices below retail. however, the price difference between a new and a pre-owned milgauss is not that significant and the gap seems to be closing. as of 2021, the prices for used rolex milgauss watches are: milgauss 116400 price: starting at $6,995 milgauss 116400gv price: starting at $7,995 rolex air-king prices: retail vs. used with its straightforward stainless steel construction, smaller 34mm case size, and time-only dial, the air-king was historically one of rolex's most affordable watches. however, in 2014, rolex discontinued the air-king and brought it back in 2016 as a very different watch. the current rolex air-king is now larger, sporting a 40mm case with a black dial with colorful details, and it has been given the same antimagnetic capabilities as the milgauss. its retail price has also increased to reflect the changes and below is a chart that illustrates the change in msrp of the following references: air-king ref. 114200 (2007 – 2014) air-king ref. 116900 (2016 – present) air-king price similar to the majority of stainless steel models, pre-owned air-king prices have also increased in recent years to levels close to or above retail. as of 2021, the cost of owning used air-king watches are as follows: pre-owned air-king ref. 114200 price: starting at $4,995 pre-owned air-king ref. 116900 price: starting at $6,995 rolex sky-dweller prices: retail vs. used the sky-dweller is the newest model to join the rolex catalog, first released in 2012. with a gold fluted bezel on top of its 42mm case, the sky-dweller borrows its design from other rolex dress watches but benefits from an annual calendar complication and a dual timezone display. the sky-dweller was initially exclusively available in solid 18k gold but in 2017, rolex released a pair of rolesor versions - one that paired a stainless steel case with a white gold bezel and the other in a two-tone yellow gold and steel combination. given that the rolesor sky-dweller watches have only been around since 2017, their retails prices have only increased by a few hundred dollars. sky-dweller ref. 326934 (2017 – present) sky-dweller ref. 326933 (2017 – present) rolesor sky-dweller price while rolex has not significantly increased the price of the steel and white gold sky-dweller, the value of pre-owned editions has skyrocketed. both rolesor sky-dweller watches are currently valued above their retail prices on the secondary market and it's not uncommon for the steel/white gold variant - particularly the one with the blue dial - to resell for almost double. prices for used rolex sky-dweller watches as of 2021 are as follows: pre-owned sky-dweller 326934 price: starting at $26,995 pre-owned sky-dweller 326933 price: starting at $19,495 rolex day-date prices: retail vs. used as it is rolex's most prestigious watch model and exclusively fashioned from precious metals, day-date watches, also known as rolex president watches, are some of the brand's priciest pieces. although day-date watches are available in three different shades of gold and platinum, the most popular are yellow gold rolex presidentials. below is a graph charting the increase in msrp of yellow gold rolex day-date watches, covering the following references: day-date 36 ref. 118238 (2000 – 2019) day-date 36 ref. 128238 (2019 – present) day-date ii ref. 218238 (2008 – 2015) day-date 40 ref. 228238 (2015 – present) yellow gold day-date price it used to be common to find pre-owned day-date watches at prices well below retail. however, yellow gold rolex day-date watches have been having a major moment these last few years and their popularity has driven up the prices in the pre-owned market. 2021 prices for used rolex president watches are as follows: pre-owned day-date 36 118238 price: starting at $22,195 pre-owned day-date 36 128238 price: starting at $32,995 pre-owned day-date ii 218238 price: starting at $34,995 pre-owned day-date 40 228238 price: starting at $36,995 datejust prices: retail vs. used the datejust has been rolex's flagship watch since its inception in 1945. the datejust is available in a vast assortment of sizes, materials, and styles but some of the most popular are the stainless steel variants with case sizes that measure 36mm or 41mm. below is a graph detailing the retail prices of steel rolex datejust watches, covering the following references: datejust 36 ref. 16200 (1989 – 2006) datejust 36 ref. 116200 (2006 – 2018) datejust 36 ref. 126200 (2018 – present) datejust ii ref. 116300 (2012 – 2017) datejust 41 ref. 126300 (2017 – present) stainless steel datejust prices good news for rolex fans looking to buy a pre-owned datejust - some references can still be found below the retail prices of the most current models. yet, the latest generation of steel datejust watches, whether datejust 36 or datejust 41, are selling for a premium on the pre-owned market. the prices for used rolex datejust watches as of 2021 are as follows: pre-owned datejust 36 16200 price: starting at $5,195 pre-owned datejust 36 116200 price: starting at $5,495 pre-owned datejust 36 126200 price: starting at $7,695 pre-owned datejust ii 116300 price: starting at $8,195 pre-owned datejust 41 126300 price: starting at $8,995 rolex oyster perpetual prices: retail vs. used the oyster perpetual is rolex's entry-level watch, combining a water-resistant oyster case in stainless steel with an automatic perpetual movement that powers the time-only dial. rolex has offered the oyster perpetual in various sizes over the years and the below retail price chart tracks the following references: oyster perpetual 36 ref. 116000 (2008 – 2020) oyster perpetual 36 ref. 126000 (2020 – present) oyster perpetual 39 ref. 114300 (2015 – 2020) oyster perpetual 41 ref. 124300 (2020 – present) oyster perpetual prices thanks to rolex releasing a brand new oyster perpetual lineup with colorful dials in 2020, the entry-level rolex is trading well above retail prices in the pre-owned market. as of 2021, the prices for used oyster perpetual watches are as follows: pre-owned oyster perpetual 36 116000 price: starting at $5,495 pre-owned oyster perpetual 36 126000 price: starting at $7,195 pre-owned oyster perpetual 39 price: starting at $7,195 pre-owned oyster perpetual 41 price: starting at $8,295 how a rolex price is determined for a vintage or used watch the rolex price range is incredibly vast; however the actual fair market value of a pre-owned watch isn't just about its age. in fact, a vintage rolex can often fetch a significantly higher price than a second-hand watch from the current generation. so, what are all the factors that can determine a pre-owned rolex price when evaluating its fair market value? condition the overall condition of a watch can make or break its value. by assessing the aesthetics and functionality of a used rolex, a knowledgeable dealer can properly price the watch at its true fair market value. in most instances, the better the condition of a watch, the higher its fair market value will be. however, sometimes when dealing with rare vintage references, certain signs of age such as tropical dials, ghost bezels, and patina can actually increase the value of the watch. original features and authenticity there's a difference between an entirely circa-correct rolex and an authentic rolex, and they can both play greatly into the overall rolex price range for a specific pre-owned model. an entirely circa-correct rolex means that the watch boasts components that are all correct for the time period in which it was produced - a good sign that it likely still has all of its original factory parts (although there is no way to definitively tell that something wasn't replaced with an identical component from the exact same era at some point during its previous life). typically, prices on the vintage rolex market are much stronger for watches that are completely circa-correct, even if they show signs of wear and age. an authentic rolex is a watch that is completely genuine - meaning that every single component on it is made by rolex, with no aftermarket or custom additions whatsoever. however, a rolex can be 100% authentic without being circa-correct. typically when parts need to be replaced, rolex replaces them with the newest compatible versions for that watch. these replacement components are entirely genuine, and are often superior from a purely functional standpoint; however for certain components on highly-collectable vintage models, these later-era replacement parts can sometimes detract significantly from the value of the timepiece. box and papers this isn't always a huge factor, as a lot of rolex watches sold on the pre-owned market come without the original box or papers. however, for certain vintage rolex models, the inclusion of their original box and paperwork can significantly increase their value for collections. many times, these items were lost or otherwise separated from their accompanying watches over the years, and so finding a vintage rolex that still has its original box and papers is becoming an increasingly rare occurrence. model and reference numbers some rolex watches are more popular or collectable than others and that's just a fact. for example, most of the time a vintage submariner is going to fetch a higher price than a vintage datejust, simply because more datejust watches were sold over the years, and (generally speaking) most people took better care of them. you also have to consider the reference number of the watch itself, as there can be large price differences between them that can really dictate resale value. for example, a ref. 5512 and a ref. 5513 submariner may look almost identical, but there is often a significant difference in price between these two models, even when they are from a similar year of production. provenance and rarity the model and reference number both significantly play into the overall rarity of a rolex, and consequently influence its pricing. however, sometimes these factors hardly come into play at all. for example, you may own a rather common and inauspicious rolex model, but if it previously belonged to a celebrity or other noteworthy individual, that gives the watch a serious provenance and can significantly increase its resale value. similarly, rare or unusual traits can also significantly increase a rolex price far beyond what would normally be the fair market value for similar examples of the same reference. additionally, you may have a rolex from a not-particularly-special reference, but if it has a rare dial or some other unusual feature or even a factory defect, that also has the potential to make it rare and quite a bit more valuable to collectors. market value while all of these things play into determining the value of a rolex, the secondary market also drives the prices of rolex watches - just like a stock market. bob's watches uses this same open market system to help us both buy and sell watches at the most fair prices anywhere online. we publish both the buy and sell prices for every rolex model, so that both buyers and sellers can verify that they are getting the best possible deal. however, because the demand for rolex watches far exceeds the supply at a retail level, multi-year waiting lists for many of the brand's top models exist at virtually all retailers around the globe. consequently, this strong market demand can drive the fair market values for certain rolex watches well above their original retail prices. for some ultra-desirable models like the stainless steel rolex daytona, if you are lucky enough to find one at retail, you can turn around and sell it for almost twice what you paid for it! used rolex prices as an investment in some cases, if you buy a brand-new rolex, it may depreciate once you leave the store with them. however, as we've illustrated, more and more rolex watches sell for significantly higher than their original retail prices. chances are that you will be able to sell your rolex in the future for roughly the same sum, should the need arise. you could buy a submariner today and offload it again in ten years time for an amount similar to what you paid for it (or more) - meaning that you have worn an icon of horology for a decade, completely for free. choose the right rolex model and you also stand a very good chance of making a profit. a number of rolex's stainless steel sports watches only keep growing in terms of desirability, and the amount that collectors are willing to pay for them increases in tandem. even if you don't want to part with your rolex, you still have the peace of mind knowing that, if looked after properly, your watch will easily outlast you and can be handed down to the next generation to enjoy - and there are very few other things that can make a similar claim. there are many reasons a rolex watch costs what it does. while it can initially seem like a lot of money, once you look below the surface and take into account the quality of the materials, the timeless nature of the designs, the more than a century of heritage, and the fact they hold their value so well, the price of a rolex watch is actually pretty reasonable. the product of the biggest and most successful watchmaker in the world, there's nothing quite like a rolex. frequently asked questions below are some of the most frequently asked questions about used rolex prices. what is the price of a new rolex submariner? rolex released the newest collection of submariner watches in 2020 with 41mm cases and new-generation movements. the retail price of a new rolex submariner ranges from $8,100 to $39,650. submariner ref. 124060: $8,100 submariner ref. 126610ln: $9,150 submariner ref. 126610lv: $9,550 submariner ref. 126613ln: $14,300 submariner ref. 126613lb: $14,300 submariner ref. 126618ln: $36,950 submariner ref. 126618lb: $36,950 submariner ref. 126619lb: $39,650 however, due to the high demand for these watches and the accompanying waitlist, the pre-owned prices for most of these references - particularly the stainless steel models - are quite a bit higher than their original retail prices. how do you buy a rolex at retail price? due to the massive global demand for rolex watches, it can be almost impossible to buy select rolex model at retail prices. it typically requires an already existing relationship with a rolex authorized dealer and a willingness to wait a very long time to finally get the chance to buy one. it's been reported that some rolex watches, like the current steel daytona, submariner, and gmt-master ii, have waitlists that are multiple years-long. what is the price of rolex gmt master ii? rolex released the newest collection of gmt-master ii watches in 2018 with redesigned cases, new bezel color options, new material combinations, and new-generation movements. the price of a new rolex gmt-master ii at retail ranges from $9,700 to $39,900. gmt-master ii 126710blnr: $9,700 gmt-master ii 126710blro: $9,700 gmt-master ii 126711chnr: $14,800 gmt-master ii 126715chnr: $38,250 gmt-master ii 126719blro: $38,250 gmt-master ii 126719blro (meteorite dial): $39,900 however, due to demand for these watches, the pre-owned prices of the latest steel gmt-master ii models start at $15,595 for the "batman" and $17,995 for the "pepsi." are rolex watches worth the price? rolex's longtime approach of continuously enhancing its watches with modern materials and mechanical improvements, while simultaneously not drastically changing designs has proven to be a winning formula. rolex outsells every other luxury watch brand -
