so your order will ship out the very next business day. orders placed after 2pm pst will generally ship out the 2nd business day. please note that all orders must be shipped to the address on file with your credit card company. if you would like your order shipped to an address that is different, other than the one on record with the issuing bank, we ask that you contact your credit card company by calling the phone number on the back of your credit card, and request to place an “alternate shipping address” on record, so that we can verify this information. by stating that you want an “alternate shipping address” it will simply be a notation on your record and should not cause any change in your billing information. it is another fraud-prevention method that we use to be certain that we are dealing with the actual cardholder. estimated delivery dates are based upon orders received by 2pm pst, monday through friday, excluding holidays. if your order is placed and approved before 2pm pst monday through friday, it will generally ship on the next business day. orders placed after 2pm pst on friday generally ship on tuesday. no orders are shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays. we cannot guarantee any particular delivery date. items ordered together may ship separately. payment by wire orders paid by wire will be shipped on the day we receive confirmation of the funds from our bank. the cut off time to receive incoming wires is 3pm pst.  please note that we accept wire transfers only.  no ach'es or other forms of electronic transfer will be accepted. please note that orders will be cancelled for non-payment two full business days after the order has been placed without receiving funds or a proper confirmation. payment by google checkout orders paid in this manner will be shipped as soon as we receive confirmation and approval from google merchant services. we cannot ship until this approval occurs.  approvals received by 3pm pst will ship that same day and approvals received after 3pm pst will ship the next business day. paypal orders can be shipped only to the “verified” address on record. if you are an international customer we do offer shipping for a additional fees. only wired payments will be accepted on international orders. other important notes you must provide a street address. fedex will not deliver to p.o. boxes, apo or fpo addresses including u.s territories/provinces. all us orders are shipped free fedex standard overnight insured and will be delivered on a business day, monday through friday. there are no deliveries on saturday, sunday, or holidays. fedex is our only shipping carrier. shipping methods other than fedex are not presently accepted for orders made through this site. sales and use tax notice recently many states have issued guidance regarding purchases for which residents did not pay sales tax. when sales tax is not charged, use tax may be due on transaction that may have otherwise been taxable. it follows the same rules and requirements as sales tax. there are three common instances where a use tax obligation may occur: ordering from a mail‐order catalog buying over the internet buying goods in another state but having the merchant ship the goods to you in your resident state as opposed to you taking possession of them in the store. in all of these circumstances, if sales tax is not charged and the goods are shipped to you in your resident state, you may owe use tax to your resident state. use tax is not owed if you pay another state’s sales tax on the purchase. remember though that not all internet and mail‐order catalog purchases are subject to use tax. please refer to your local city, county, or state taxing agency for questions on whether use tax may be applicable to your purchase. the above "sales and use tax notice" is intended for general guidance and informational purposes only. this information is provided with the understanding that it does not render legal, accounting, tax, or other professional advice and services, nor does it promote, market or recommend to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein. the above should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional advisers and cannot be relied upon by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties imposed under the internal revenue code. before making any decision or taking any action, you should obtain appropriate professional guidance. bob'sshipping info newport beach 1900 quail st. newport beach, ca 92660 mon -
