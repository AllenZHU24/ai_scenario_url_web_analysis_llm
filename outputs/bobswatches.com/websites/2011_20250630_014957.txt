"selling a rolex watch", or even "how to sell my rolex watch". selling  a pre-owned rolex watch can seem like there is no easy solution.  where do you sell, what is it worth, and who can i trust are just some of the questions that sellers seem to wrestle with. often times, because of our hectic, fast paced lifestyles, it's often easier to just leave it in the top dresser draw or the safety deposit box. most rolex watch owners are higher net worth folks whose time is valuable.  so here at bob's, we have kept that in mind when we developed a sell rolex program for owners who want to either sell or trade for a different model.  here are a few of the main choices for people looking to sell rolex watch models: list it on ebay list it on craigslist find a local jeweler who may or may not know the real market value send it to bob's watches listing an item like a rolex watch on ebay is not an easy solution. first off, you need an established ebay account and paypal that most private sellers do not have. more importantly, most private sellers are not experienced on how to list the item, how to price it, and then hassle with collecting the money from potentially unethical buyers. craigslist: even if you did know the correct price to sell the watch, do you really want buyers coming to your home to buy your watch? local jewelers: while this is sometimes a fair option for sellers, most regular jewelers will not know the up to date current market value of the watch and will not have the efficient sell marketplace to resell the item.  for these reasons, it is unlikely you will receive the best price for your pre-owned rolex with this option. bob's watches: one of the primary reasons we founded bob's watches was to establish an efficient marketplace with a trusted buyer and seller. since there was such a void in the markeplace for this service, we have enjoyed remarkable success by providing better value for the seller and for the buyer as well.  most people

expensive they last pretty much forever if you take care of them and are therefore a pretty good investment. rolex sells thousands of new watches through their authorized dealers all over the world and the fact that rolex do last such a long time allows for a huge secondary market.  when you buy a rolex, it is not a one owner watch, whether you pass it down to your children and grandchildren or sell it to another person, they usually last through multiple generations. this also allows the values to be very high and if you need money or, just don’t really want or use it you can sell rolex brand watches to us at bob’s watches for great prices. bob’s buying goals our goal at bob’s watches is to essentially “pinch” the market. what this means is that we make the margin between how much we buy a watch for and how much we sell it for a lot lower and we even publicly display these two prices on the website. this allows us to buy watches for more than our competitors and sell them for less. often people come to us and ask to sell their watch and upon receiving the price are astounded because many other online retailers sell rolex for around a thousand dollars more than what we offered. why this happens is these retailers run on huge margins of thousands of dollars between how much they buy and sell a watch for and so how much they sell the watch for is really a bloated view of how much it is really worth. when you sell rolexes to bob's watches you get the true value. why bob’s is different we have found this to be an unfair and underhanded practice and so we have tried to make our business transparent by allowing our users to see how much we buy a watch for and how much we sell it for right on the site. with this information they can know that the prices we give to
