our site is very dynamic and we will drop – or raise - our buy price due to overstock or market fluctuations. in some cases, the watch you see we are selling may not have been purchased at the buy price shown. also, certain watches are less popular than others and happen to leave our shelves less quickly. these watches have the biggest difference between the buy and sell prices because we hold them longer to sell them. another reason, could be service costs since the more complicated movements have a higher cost for service than others. when is the best time to sell my rolex? there are many reasons as to why someone may choose to sell their rolex. maybe you currently sport a submariner 16610 on your wrist and you’re ready to upgrade to a 6-digit cerachrom model. or maybe you’ve finally spotted your grail watch and need to make room in your collection. whatever the reason, pre-owned rolex watches are in high demand, making it easier than ever before to sell your rolex. rolex watches are also popular milestone gifts and are sought after purchases for graduations, work anniversaries, and retirements. rolex timepieces are popular year-round, however, selling your rolex during a time of year when the demand is high, such as christmas or graduation season, ensures that you will receive the best possible price. do you do trades?

the water resistance of a rolex is usually measured in meters and defines how deep it can go underwater while keeping the case watertight. the list below shows all the available water resistance ratings and their most applicable conditions. 30, 50 and 100 meters - useable from washing hands up to swimming and snorkeling. 200 meters - shallow scuba diving 300 meters - deep scuba diving 1,000 meters or more - about 3/5 of a mile and is more water pressure than a human body can withstand avoid extended periods of time in hot water as the heat can potentially warp the gaskets which keep the water from getting in. moving from extremely hot to cold conditions can also deform the metals within the watch. the watch should generally be kept off during baths and showers as soap can decrease the gaskets' surface tension and damage the seal. what is the difference between chronograph and chronometer? a chronograph refers to watches with stopwatch functionality and typically refers to the daytona model when talking about rolex. chronographs will have two to three additional subdials or registers on the face of the watch and corresponding pushers to control them. these types of rolex watches are usually popular with those active in sports and racing where keeping time is often useful. a chronometer is a watch that has gone through extensive testing and ensured to meet certain precision standards. for swiss watches such as rolex, all watches given the "chronometer" label has been certified by the cosc, the official swiss chronometer testing institute, after severely testing the accuracy of the movement for 15 days, across multiple positions and temperatures. for mechanical watches such as 99% of rolex, they must be within +4 and -6 seconds off after the testing period in order to pass. what types of rolex watch crystals are there? there are two types of crystals used by rolex. 1. acrylic - found in older vintage rolex models, these crystals can scratch but are easy to polish or replace. 2. sapphire - these crystals are scratch resistant and are difficult to be scratched by any material except diamond and minerals with a hardness rating of 10. they are more expensive, more likely to shatter on heavy impact, and if scratches do occur, cannot be polished. how much do rolex watches cost? a rolex watch can vary depending on the type of material used, such as gold, platinum, diamonds, rarity, and market demand. in some instances, due to market demand, a stainless steel watch might be more sought after than gold models, making the two different models cost nearly the same. where are rolex watches made? rolex watches have been made in geneva, switzerland since 1919 when the company’s founders, hans wilsdorf and alfred davis, relocated the operation from london, england. why are rolex watches so expensive? when you wear a rolex watch you are essentially wearing 400 years of mechanical engineering on your wrist. those shiny stylish status symbols have evolved over hundreds of years to become extremely efficient and precise timepieces. here are a few facts you might not have known about rolex watches. each movement is handcrafted by skilled tradesmen. the parts used are of the best quality. all the gold used on a rolex comes from their in-house foundry. it takes about a year to produce a rolex watch. do rolex watches tick? all mechanical watches tick, however rolex movements are engineered in such a way that the second hand appears to sweep as opposed to tick. it has become rolex’s trademark. what questions should i ask when purchasing a rolex online? the best place to purchase a rolex brand watch is from a reputable dealer who guarantees the authenticity of their luxury watches. check to make sure that the dealer has a physical location. when buying on line, be sure that any dealer has the actual watch in store and if the photos they are showing you of the watch, are of the actual watch. ask about the servicing of the watch and if only factory rolex parts are used and about their authenticity guarantee as well as return policy. i would also check their online reviews. if a dealer is using custom parts on their site, they may also be using generic watch parts, so do inquire if a 100% factory rolex watch is important to you. where can i buy a rolex watch, who has the best prices? when looking to invest in a luxury watch you need to find the most trust name in the industry. bob’s watches has been buying and selling rolex watches since 1999. we are the leading destination for rolex buyers online. bob’s has the best prices and offers free overnight shipping, insured by fedex. all our buy and sell prices are dictated by the current market, so you can be assured that you are receiving a fair price for your timepiece. what's the least expensive rolex i can purchase? we offer a ‘sort by price’ feature to assist you. the link is located at the top navigation bar on the main page. rolex crafts its products with precious metals, including stainless steel, gold, platinum and rolesor (a combination of steel and gold), and stainless steel is the least expensive of these materials. but while models outfitted with stainless steel consistently remain the least expensive watches in the rolex lineup, keep in mind that the company was the first to use this highly corrosion-resistant super alloy 904l metal as early as 1985. so even an “inexpensive” rolex is still far ahead of anything else in its class. are rolex watches a good investment? pre-owned and select vintage rolex watches are very sound investments. in fact, rolex models over 25 years old have doubled in value. you see, brand awareness is a major factor in increasing resale demand. this is not the case with all luxury watches, but because of its history and sheer buying power in the market, rolex is an exception to the rule. those in the watch industry understand that a rolex not only holds its value but will also increase in price, thanks to its exceptional quality, appeal and desirability. add to this the incredible demand sought by rolex enthusiasts ‘round the world, and it’s easy to see why and how the value of pre-owned rolex models consistently remain at peak levels. are you on the list?
