bob'srolex watches new rolex models the global pandemic resulted in the delay of many new watch releases, and for several months, it looked like there might not be any new rolex watches in 2020 at all. however, on september 1st, rolex unveiled its new 2020 watch collections, making a number of key updates to the brand’s iconic catalog. the four rolex collections that saw new watches join them for 2020 are the submariner, oyster perpetual, sky-dweller and datejust. rolex submariner the 2020 updates to the rolex submariner mark the introduction of an all-new generation of rolex’s legendary dive watch. all of the previous 40mm models have been discontinued and replaced by new models with 41mm cases. following the 2020 update, the rolex submariner collection now consists of the following references. ref. 124060: oystersteel, black cerachrom bezel, black dial (no-date) ref. 126610ln: oystersteel, black cerachrom bezel, black dial ref. 126610lv: oystersteel, green cerachrom bezel, black dial ref. 126613ln: yellow rolesor; black ceramic bezel, black dial ref. 126613lb: yellow rolesor; blue ceramic bezel, blue dial ref. 126618ln: yellow gold, black cerachrom bezel, black dial ref. 126618lb: yellow gold, blue cerachrom bezel, blue dial ref. 126619lb: white gold, blue cerachrom bezel, black dial official retail prices for the new 41mm generation of submariner watches start out at $8,100 for the standard, stainless steel no-date model and $9,150 for the version with the date complication. from there, prices increase with the use of precious metals, topping out at $39,650 for the solid 18k white gold model fitted with a black dial and a blue cerachom bezel insert. with that in mind, due to demand far exceeding supply at a retail level, the second-hand prices for the new 2020 submariner models are expected to be quite a bit higher than their original retail prices. it is still too early to tell what the overall availability of these models will look like going forward, but some of the very first examples of the stainless steel models to surface on the secondary market are currently trading hands for roughly twice their original retail prices. rolex oyster perpetual next to the submariner, the rolex oyster perpetual was the collection that saw the next largest update for 2020. the biggest update to the oyster perpetual was the introduction of a new 41mm model, replacing the fan-favorite 39mm version within the oyster perpetual lineup. additionally, the smallest size option increased from 26mm to 28mm, and the entire collection received new movements, bringing the oyster perpetual into the modern era. the new 2020 rolex oyster perpetual collection ref. 276200: 28mm case diameter ref. 277200: 31mm case diameter ref. 124200: 34mm case diameter ref. 126000: 36mm case diameter ref. 124300: 41mm case diameter prices range from $5,100 for the 28mm model to $5,900 for the 41mm version, and all models are exclusively offered stainless steel, regardless of their case size. additionally, while the new movements are certainly big news, the other key 2020 update to the oyster perpetual line is the new assortment of brightly colored dials that are reminiscent of the vintage stella dials from the 1970s. while it is expected that second-hand prices for the new models will remain relatively close to their original retail prices, many speculate that certain dials colors for the 36mm and 41mm size options (such as yellow and red) may be difficult to find and will likely end up trading hands for a slight premium on the open market. rolex sky-dweller the rolex sky-dweller also received new additions for 2020, but the new models are not really really all-new watches, but rather new variations of the existing sky-dweller paired with rolex’s oysterflex bracelet. all of the various sky-dweller watches with leather straps have been discontinued, and these two new oysterflex sky-dweller watches seem to take their place in the new 2020 catalog. the new rolex sky-dweller watches for 2020 are the following references, and both are crafted from solid 18k gold. ref. 326238: 18k yellow gold, oysterflex bracelet ref. 326235: 18k everose gold, oysterflex bracelet official retail prices are $40,000 for the yellow gold model and $41,500 for the everose gold version, regardless of the dial color fitted to these two watches. as the oysterflex bracelet remains a highly desirable option within rolex’s catalog, exclusively fitted to the brand’s solid 18k gold models, many expect these new 2020 oysterflex sky-dweller models to retail their value quite well, and some even predict that they may end up trading hands for slight premiums above their original retail prices. rolex datejust 31 rolex has continuously been updating its iconic datejust collection over the years, and although the 36mm and 41mm were just updated in previous years, 2020 marked the arrival of new datejust 31 watches in stainless steel and white rolesor. ref. 278240: stainless steel, smooth bezel ref. 278274: white rolesor, fluted bezel ref. 278344rbr: white rolesor, diamond-set bezel ref. 278384rbr: white rolesor, diamond-set bezel all of the models are powered by rolex’s caliber 2236 movement, and feature stainless steel cases paired with either steel or 18k white gold bezels. retail prices range from $6,600 for the entirely stainless steel model up to $16,050 for the model with the full-diamond bezel. as these new datejust 31 models are not sports watches, it is expected that their second-hand prices will stay more-or-less close to their original retail values, and may anticipate that the diamond-set models will ultimately be able to be found at a discount on the pre-owned market. about rolex watches founded by hans wilsdorf in 1905, rolex has grown significantly in both size and prestige over the course of its long and illustrious history and has carefully cultivated a reputation that is synonymous with quality,

collectors have likely seen their watches appreciate significantly. top rolex watches rolex cosmograph daytona first introduced in 1963 and remaining a part of rolex's catalog ever since, this iconic sport model is the unrivaled tool watch for racing enthusiasts who have a passion for speed and performance. as of 2020, this legendary model is available in stainless steel, solid gold, and two tone steel and gold. the current stainless steel model is the reference 116500ln, which is available with a black or white dial and retails for $13,150. however, the watch trades hands for significantly more than its original retail price on the pre-owned market, simply due to demand far exceeding supply and the presence of multi-year waiting lists present at a retail level. rolex submariner date this ultimate dive watch has always been a standout favorite in the brand's lineup and some vintage models have recently sold for millions. the current date-displaying model is the reference 126610ln, which was released in september 2020 and retails for $9,150. rolex gmt-master ii first launched in 1983, the gmt-master ii is a horology icon and current model maintains its original tool feature for displaying two different time zones simultaneously. the current reference 126710blro (pepsi) retails for $9,700 in steel. how much is a rolex watch? the price can vary greatly depending on the specific model, the metals/materials used in its construction, the overall condition of the timepiece (and its box/accessories), and whether the watch is being sold as pre-owned or brand-new. certain used watches can be purchased for as little as a few thousand dollars; however others sell for hundreds of thousands – sometimes even millions of dollars, and represent some of the most expensive wristwatches in the world. model reference price (approx.) type day-date ref. 228238 36,550 usd sporty dress watch daytona ref. 116500ln 13,150 usd chronograph cellini date ref. 50515 17,900 usd dress

collection the brand currently produces about a dozen different oyster perpetual watch models. among the most timeless of the available models are: submariner the oyster perpetual submariner. originally designed for diving and boasting an impressive maximum submergible depth of 300 meters, the submariner can be found on 007's wrist in 11 james bond movies. president day date the president, also known as "el presidente," this is the day-date model – which was the first to display the day and date in its entirety – customized with the president bracelet. named for its first recipient, president dwight d. eisenhower. date the oyster perpetual date gmt master. designed in collaboration with pan am airlines to be used by pilots and navigators, this model displays two time zones at once. before the days of gps, an accurate gmt source was a must for aviation planning, weather forecasts, and scheduling. sea-dweller the oyster perpetual date sea-dweller. this line of watches, designed with professional divers in mind, is the most water resistant mechanical watch on the market. director james cameron affixed one to the dsv deepsea challenger as it made its dive into the deepest point of any ocean. cellini the cellini. named for benvenuto cellini, a goldsmith and papal sculptor during the italian renaissance, this watch is a true classic. this perfect dress watch, which embodies nobility and elegance, is available in three different versions, cellini date, cellini time, and cellini dual time. daytona the oyster perpetual cosmograph daytona. the archetype of the sport watch for racing drivers. the late legend paul newman received it as a gift from his wife in 1972 and would go on to wear it every day until his passing in 2008. datejust the perpetual datejust. the first wristwatch to feature a date function, this model served as the basis for the submariner. chuck yeager was wearing the perpetual date - just when he broke the sound barrier in 1947. gmt-master the oyster perpetual date gmt master. designed in collaboration with pan am airlines to be used by pilots and navigators, this model displays two time zones at once. before the days of gps, an accurate gmt source was a must for aviation planning, weather forecasts, and scheduling. milgauss the oyster perpetual milgauss. this line of watches was designed as an antimagnetic watch for those who work in places where electromagnetic fields disrupt the timing mechanism of a watch, like research labs and power plants. from the latin words mille and gauss, this watch can withstand a magnetic flux density of 1,000 gauss. air-king the air king. one of the longest, continuously manufactured models and among the most affordable – the manually-wound "warrior watch" was created by wilsdorf to be used by the british royal air force during the 1930s. senator john mccain still proudly wears an air king. yacht-master the yacht-master. first released in 1992, this line of sport watches is available in a lady's model and is notable for being the first instance releasing a man’s model with smaller dimensions. sky-dweller the sky-dweller was released in 2012. this line of watches is the first to offer both dual time zones and an annual calendar. the calendar only needs to be reset every fourth year to accommodate leap year. browse our pre-owned watches for sale bob's watches is the

the making of a perfect luxury watch the brand will typically make a number of their watches out  of stainless steel, but many styles offer more luxurious metals, like 18k yellow and white gold and even rose gold. this allows for a number of metal options for those looking to buy pre-owned gold models on the secondary market. there is also a line of two tone (stainless and gold) types available. this combination of metal is referred to as rolesor. bezel and dial colors can include black, blue, green, white, and silver among others. men's watches range in size from 34mm to 45mm, depending on the style. depending on the materials used (such as diamonds, gold, etc), year the watch was made, its model and its rarity, prices can range from as little as a few thousand dollars to over $1.2 million for some rare vintage models. common rolex questions while the brand is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable in the world, they are notoriously tight-lipped. naturally, many people have questions and have a hard time finding reputable sources of information. we have spent years researching everything there is to know about the legendary swiss brand, and we have compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions. what is the cheapest rolex watch? prices for brand-new models start out at $5,100 for the oyster perpetual: the smallest and least expensive ladies model. prices quickly increase from there depending on size, model, materials, and additional features/complications. for used watches, pricing can be a bit more ambiguous; however since the brand is one of the most well known luxury companies on this planet, it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever come across a genuine piece being sold for only a few hundred dollars. additionally, not all watches are sold in proper working order; and in many instances, it is the watches being sold for the cheapest prices that often require the most expensive repairs. below, you'll find a list of the least expensive watches in the catalogue: - oyster perpetual 28mm: $5,100- oyster perpetual 31mm: $5,200- oyster perpetual 34mm: $5,300- oyster perpetual 36mm: $5,600- oyster perpetual 41mm: $5,900- datejust 31mm: $6,600- air-king: $6,450- lady-datejust 28mm: $6,500- date 34mm: $6,500- explorer: $6,550- datejust 36mm: $7,050 how much is a used rolex? much like brand-new watches, the price of a used model can vary greatly depending on the specific model, its materials, and the overall condition of the timepiece itself. it is also worth noting that used watches can often sell for significantly more than brand-new ones due to their age, rarity, and overall desirability. additionally, it is not uncommon for certain pre-owned watches, which are still currently in production, to sell for more than brand-new examples, simply due to an overwhelming demand and the existence of multi-year-long waitlists at authorized retailers. why are rolex so expensive? universally recognized for producing some of the finest and most reliable timepieces available, rolex only uses the very best materials to create its watches. precious metals such as 18k gold and 950 platinum are inherently expensive, however rolex also puts the same industry-leading level of precision engineering and attention to detail into every single watch that it creates. is a rolex watch a good investment? do they hold their value? rolex watches can retain their value better than comparable timepieces from almost any other manufacturer. this characteristic allows them to serve as functional investments that can be worn and used every single day. nearly all watches are able to hold their value reasonably well; however certain models have the ability to appreciate if given enough time and/or the right market conditions. additionally, even when a piece is old and damaged, it will always be worth something, since it can always be repaired or (at the very least) used for its salvageable components. where is rolex made? rolex watches are made in switzerland. rolex is known for manufacturing all of its watches entirely in-house, and even produces some of the raw materials used to create its watches from inside its own switzerland-based foundry. what is a certified pre-owned rolex? a certified pre-owned watch is a used rolex watch that has been professionally inspected by a third-party certification service for both condition and authenticity. certified pre-owned are issued a report, which attests to their originality/authenticity, and details the condition of the watch’s most important components. in order to be a certified authentic, each watch must go through a comprehensive process that consists of rigorous criteria and meticulously performed procedures. certified pre-owned are guaranteed to be 100% authentic, and every timepiece sold by bob’s watches comes with an optional and independent third-party certification report issued by watchcsa, the leading authority on timepiece certification. how to tell if a rolex is real there are a number of different ways to tell if a rolex is real, but one of the best ways is to look at the details on the watch in question. rolex watches are some of the finest timepieces on earth, and they should look like it. if the watch feels cheap or has any sloppy printing, that's a good sign that it may not be a real rolex. be sure to check out our full comprehensive guide on how to spot a fake rolex, and if you still are unsure, you can always bring it to your nearest authorized rolex retailer to confirm. are all rolex watches made from real gold? the short answer is no. although the brand makes some of the finest and most expensive watches in the world, many of their most famous and desirable offerings are constructed from their patented 904l stainless steel, while others are made from solid 950 platinum. on modern models, any components that appear to be gold are actually constructed from solid 18k gold; however many years ago, the company did manufacture watches that were made from stainless steel and covered with gold caps/shells on their outer surfaces to give them the appearance of having an all-gold construction. do rolex tick? the vast majority of rolex watches are powered by mechanical movements. this means that they do not tick once per second like most modern watches. however, rolex did produce a small handful of battery-powered quartz watches previously in its history, so this rule does have its exceptions for these 'oysterquartz' models. additionally, like other mechanical watches, if a rolex is left to sit for multiple days it will stop running until it is either worn again or manually wound through the winding crown. how to wind a rolex many rolex watches are equipped with automatic self-winding movements that wind themselves with the natural motion of your arm, however these watches can also be manually wound - similar to how you would on a traditional pocket watch. to wind a rolex, you unscrew the winding crown and rotate it clockwise. this will manually supply tension to the mainspring, and allow it to run while off your wrist. can you buy a rolex for $1000? you may find a rolex for sale at a really cheap price, but you likely won't be able to buy a rolex for as as little as $1,000. genuine rolex watches are highly desirable and the brand is universally known, so when you see one for sale at an unbelievably cheap price, there is a pretty good chance that there is something wrong with it. the watch may require very expensive repairs or even have non-genuine components on it. always remember: if the deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. what is the best rolex to buy? the best rolex to buy comes down to what you want out of your watch. rolex watches come in all different shapes and sizes and many were built for specific purposes such as scuba diving or yacht racing. the best rolex watch for one person might not be the best for another, and it is most important to find a rolex model that fits your wrist and works well with your lifestyle. can you wear a rolex everyday? you can certainly wear a rolex every single day! rolex watches make some of the best daily-wear timepieces available and can last multiple lifetimes when properly maintained. despite being considered luxury items, rolex watches are incredibly durable and offer their owners many years of reliable performance. why you should buy used women's or men's rolex while the experience of walking into an authorized dealer and purchasing brand-new can be exciting, buying pre-owned is a much smarter and more practical method of securing a timepiece from one of the most important luxury watch brands in history. buying used from bob's watches can be a smart choice if one is considering the purchase as a long-term investment. the difference between certified pre-owned vs used vs new just like a car, every piece can only be sold as "brand-new" once, and can only be sold as brand-new by an authorized dealer. as soon as the watch leaves the dealership and the warranty card has been filled out, that timepiece is technically pre-owned, even if it is not worn a single time after that. even if you purchased brand-new, that watch is now considered pre-owned because you are now the owner of it. should you wish to sell that same watch – even if you only owned it for a single day, and never wore it once – that watch is technically considered used, and in the vast majority of instances, will be worth less than what you originally paid for it. while the amount of depreciation can vary significantly depending on the model of watch and its use of precious metals, there will (almost) always be some degree of reduction in value that immediately occurs the moment the watch leaves the authorized dealer. although used and certified pre-owned (cpo) might sound similar, the primary distinction is that cpo watches are certified authentic typically by an independent third party. at bob's watches, our authenticity pledge guarantees through an independent service provider that each of our pieces are in fact 100% authentic. read more where to buy a
