engraves a unique, 5 to 8 digit serial number to every watch it makes that helps determine the approximate date, or year of production for that particular watch.  these sets of numbers, for example 28000 for the year 1926 or z000001 for year 2006, are inscribed by machine on the side of the watch case between the lugs at 6 o’clock. in 2005, however, rolex began engraving the serial numbers onto the inner rim of the watch, called the “rehaut”, for stylistic reasons.  beginning in 2010, rolex stopped following any sequential numbering system or order altogether and now engraves its watches with a randomized, arbitrary unique identifying number. while it had been relatively easy to ascertain a watch’s approximate age, or year of production using a database of lists assembled over the years, this will no longer be possible with these new random mixed serial numbers (typical samples include “mn72lk22” or “ jh675tr1” ). while there is no “official” rolex serial numbers database list from the rolex factory that shows dates of production, this chart below lists all the serial numbers gathered by proven authorities over the years. see the list below by production year to learn the year your watch was made. we've also added a serial numbers look-up table for tudor watches below. these charts will be frequently updated to reflect any changes in the numbering system for future years. for more information on how these numbers work, click here - wikipedia. rolex serial numbers - production years tableserial year serial year serial year serial year serial year serial year

production year find my rolex model number get a quote for my rolex how to find the serial numbers on your rolex watch the serial numbers can be found in one of two places on the watch.  first check the inner rim of the watch face (also called the rehaut, which is french for "flange") between the dial and the crystal. if the watch was produced in 2005 or newer the serial should be engraved on the rehaut. on older rolexes, this serial is located on the side of the watch case at the 6 o'clock position where the bracelet is attached. to view these serial numbers, the bracelet must be detached from the 6 'clock side of the case. for instructions on removing the bracelet, see the video to the right or call us at 1-800-494-3708 to speak with a rolex expert. if you are searching "where to find

with a unique rolex serial numbers, and a rolex models number since the 1920’s as tool to track the production year of a rolex watch. the production age of a pre-owned rolex watch is a significant factor in determining its current market value. as you would expect, the value of a rolex watch, unlike a fine wine, will decrease in value as new, improved models are launched by rolex. for example, watches that have rolex model numbers beginning with the letter z were produced in the year 2006 and, all things considered, are valued higher than say a rolex with serial numbers that begins with p for the year 2000. the age along with other factors such as the condition of the bracelet will help bob's establish the true, fair market value of the wristwatch.   this distinctive serial number is located on the inside case of the watch between the lugs below the 6 o’clock end of the watch. it is a five to seven digit number starting with 28000 in the year 1926.  you will need to remove the bracelet carefully from the watch using a small screw driver or tack. while this number will tell us when the watch was made by rolex, it will not tell us when the watch was eventually sold. also worth noting is that the condition of the watch is as important as its age.  the rolex serial numbers (also referred to as rolex style numbers or case number), is also helpful in determining if a watch such as a  submariner watch is a genuine authentic rolex as some fakes do not have serial numbers.  this "look up" tool, or widget, is the only one of its kind in the industry and allows people to easily find the manufacture date of their pre-owned rolex by the rolex band serial numbers.  ebay has a list or chart of the serial numbers with estimated production dates but they too do not have an easy to use look up tool like we provide here. note: if you need help on how to find the rolex case number (serial #), please view the video below or check out find my rolex serial numbers for a
