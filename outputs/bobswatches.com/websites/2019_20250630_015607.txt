can be found engraved between the lugs on the side of the case above 12 o’clock. the model number can indicate the model type, bezel, and material of your watch. for example, the reference number 16234 can be broken out into three section, which is 162 | 3 | 4. the first, 162, indicates that this watch is a datejust. the second, 3, indicates that the bezel is fluted. the third, 4, indicates that the watch material is stainless w/ 18k white gold.... read more what the numbers mean: the first two or three digits indicate the model type of the watch. if the model number is five digits long, the 5th number defines the type of bezel it has and the last number defines the material the watch is made of. hence, a 16610 would be a submariner with an engine turned bezel made of stainless steel.

a rolex watch. the production age of a pre-owned rolex watch is a significant factor in determining its current market value. as you would expect, the value of a rolex watch, unlike a fine wine, will decrease in value as new, improved models are launched by rolex. for example, watches that have rolex model numbers beginning with the letter z were produced in the year 2006 and, all things considered, are valued higher than say a rolex with serial numbers that begins with p for the year 2000. the age along with other factors such as the condition of the bracelet will help bob's establish the true, fair market value of the wristwatch. this distinctive serial number is located on the inside case of the watch between the lugs below the 6 o’clock end of the watch. it is a five to seven digit number starting with 28000 in the year 1926. you will need to remove the bracelet carefully from the watch using a small screw driver or tack. while this number will tell us when the watch was made by rolex, it will not tell us when the watch was eventually sold. also worth noting is that the condition of the watch is as important as its age. the rolex serial numbers (also referred to as rolex style numbers or case number), is also helpful in determining if a watch such as a submariner watch is a genuine authentic rolex as some fakes do not have serial numbers (see how to spot a fake rolex article for tips). when inspecting the different models of rolex watches this "look up" tool, or widget, is the only one of its kind in the industry and allows people to easily find the manufacture date of their pre-owned rolex by the rolex band serial numbers. ebay has a list or chart of the serial numbers with estimated production dates but they too do not have an easy to use look up tool like we provide here. note: if you need help on how to find the rolex case number (serial #), please view the video below or check out find my rolex serial numbers for a quick and
