functionality. the bullhead's distinctive case measures approximately 43mm x 43mm, with a thickness of about 15mm. it features a box-form sapphire crystal and a sapphire caseback. while part of the seamaster family, the bullhead offers a water resistance of 150 meters, suitable for swimming but not deep diving. its primary complication is the chronograph function, with some models also featuring a date display. due to its unique design and limited production, prices for the bullhead start around $9,000 for steel models and can reach over $30,000 for limited editions in precious metals.

seamaster watches have earned a stellar reputation for their robust construction, impressive water resistance, and array of useful functions that cater to both divers and adventurers. our comprehensive omega seamaster review delves into the key features that have made this line a favorite among watch enthusiasts and professionals alike. from precision movements to innovative materials and design elements, the seamaster collection showcases omega's unwavering commitment to horological excellence. whether you're plumbing the ocean depths or navigating daily life's complexities, the seamaster is engineered to perform reliably and stylishly. movement at the heart of every seamaster beats a precision omega movement. most modern seamaster models are equipped with omega's co-axial calibers, which offer excellent accuracy, reliability, and a lengthy power reserve. these movements represent a significant advancement in watchmaking technology, with the co-axial escapement reducing friction and improving long-term performance. the result is a watch that not only keeps precise time but also requires less frequent servicing, ensuring years of dependable operation. omega's commitment to innovation is further exemplified by their master chronometer certification, which many seamaster models now boast. this certification goes beyond the standard cosc chronometer testing, subjecting the watches to a series of rigorous tests for accuracy, water resistance, and magnetic resistance. with the ability to withstand magnetic fields up to 15,000 gauss, seamaster watches equipped with these movements offer unparalleled reliability in our increasingly magnetic world, setting a new standard for precision in mechanical watchmaking. dial the omega seamaster dial is designed for optimal underwater legibility. most models feature large, luminous hour markers and hands for easy reading in low light conditions. the dial is protected by a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal for lasting durability. omega employs various finishes and textures in their seamaster dials, from the wave pattern of the diver 300m to the teak-inspired lines of the aqua terra, adding depth and character to each watch. beyond aesthetics, seamaster dials often incorporate functional elements crucial for divers. many models feature a date window, typically magnified by a cyclops lens for easy reading. some professional diving models include helium escape valve indicators and depth rating information prominently displayed on the dial. the hands are often distinctively shaped, such as the broad arrow hour hand, to prevent confusion underwater. this combination of form and function makes the seamaster dial not just a face for timekeeping, but a vital instrument for those who rely on their watch in challenging environments. bezel the omega seamaster bezel is a key feature for divers, allowing them to track elapsed time underwater. seamaster bezels are typically unidirectional, meaning they only rotate counterclockwise to prevent underestimating dive times. many models feature ceramic or sapphire bezels for resistance to fading and scratches. the bezel markings are often filled with luminous material, ensuring visibility in low-light conditions, crucial for safe diving operations. omega has continually innovated in bezel technology, introducing materials like liquidmetal™ and ceragold™ in certain seamaster models. these advanced materials allow for seamless integration of the bezel markings, improving durability and aesthetics. some models, like the planet ocean, feature a 60-minute scale on the bezel, while others incorporate 24-hour scales for gmt functionality. the bezel's precise clicking mechanism, typically with 120 clicks per rotation, allows for accurate time setting. this attention to detail in the bezel design underscores omega's commitment to creating watches that are both functional tools and precision instruments. watch bands the omega seamaster collection offers a diverse range of band options, each designed to complement the watch's style and functionality while catering to different preferences and needs. from robust metal bracelets to comfortable rubber straps, omega ensures that there's a perfect match for every seamaster model and wearing occasion. the brand's attention to detail extends to these bands, with each option carefully crafted to enhance the overall aesthetics and performance of the watch. bracelet: an omega seamaster bracelet in classic stainless steel offers a timeless and durable option. these bracelets often feature omega's patented screw-and-pin system for added security and typically include a diver's extension for easy adjustment over a wetsuit. rubber strap: many diver 300m models come with a high-quality omega seamaster rubber strap, perfect for underwater use. these straps are engineered to resist saltwater and uv radiation, ensuring longevity and comfort in marine environments. leather strap: for a dressier look, some aqua terra models feature elegant omega seamaster leather straps. these straps are often treated for water resistance and feature quick-release spring bars for easy interchangeability. nato strap: a sporty fabric omega seamaster nato strap provides a casual and comfortable option. these straps are available in a variety of colors and patterns, allowing for easy personalization of your seamaster's look. mesh bracelet: some vintage-inspired seamaster models feature a sophisticated mesh bracelet, offering a unique blend of retro charm and modern comfort. these bracelets are known for their flexibility and breathability, making them ideal for warm weather wear. titanium bracelet: for those seeking a lightweight yet durable option, certain seamaster models offer titanium bracelets. these bracelets provide the strength of steel at nearly half the weight, enhancing comfort during extended wear. watch sizes omega seamaster watch sizes span a range to accommodate different wrist sizes and wearing preferences. from compact to oversized, there is a seamaster to suit nearly any wrist. the variety in sizes reflects omega's understanding that personal comfort and style play a significant role in the watch-wearing experience. additionally, the different sizes often correspond to specific models within the seamaster collection, each designed to balance aesthetics with functionality for its intended use. dimensions: in terms of omega seamaster dimensions, most modern men's models fall between 36mm to 44mm in case diameter. the 41mm and 42mm sizes have become particularly popular in recent years as a versatile, contemporary fit. women's models typically range from 28mm to 38mm, offering options for those who prefer a more petite timepiece. thickness: omega seamaster thickness varies depending on the specific model and its features. thinner dress styles like the aqua terra measure around 12mm to 13mm thick, while rugged dive models with a helium escape valve can measure up to a substantial 17mm thick. the thickness often correlates with the watch's water resistance and complications, with more feature-rich models generally being thicker. lug to lug: the omega seamaster lug to lug distance ranges based on the case size, but commonly falls between 46mm to 52mm. this measurement indicates how much wrist space the watch will take up from top to bottom. the lug to lug distance is crucial for determining how well a watch will fit on your wrist, especially for those with smaller or larger than average wrist sizes. lug width: the omega seamaster lug width, which determines what size straps will fit the watch, is commonly 18mm, 20mm or 22mm. it's important to know your watch's lug width when shopping for aftermarket straps or bracelets. the lug width is typically proportional to the case size, with larger watches generally having wider lug widths. case height: the case height of omega seamaster models can vary significantly, influencing how the watch sits on the wrist. dressier models like the aqua terra tend to have lower case heights for a sleeker profile, while professional dive watches may have taller cases to accommodate their robust construction and additional features. bezel diameter: for dive watch models, the bezel diameter is an important consideration. typically slightly larger than the case diameter, the bezel size affects both the watch's appearance and its ease of use underwater. larger bezels are generally easier to grip and rotate, especially when wearing diving gloves. chronometer the majority of seamaster models have been certified as chronometers by the swiss testing agency cosc, affirming their high level of precision and accuracy. this certification involves rigorous testing of the movement in various positions and temperatures, ensuring that the watch maintains accuracy within -4/+6 seconds per day. for omega, this certification is just the beginning of their commitment to precision timekeeping. in recent years, omega has taken accuracy a step further with their master chronometer certification, conducted by metas (swiss federal institute of metrology). this certification includes cosc testing but adds additional criteria, including resistance to magnetic fields up to 15,000 gauss, water resistance testing, and power reserve verification. many seamaster models now carry this prestigious certification, demonstrating omega's dedication to pushing the boundaries of mechanical watch performance. this focus on precision and reliability ensures that seamaster wearers can trust their timepiece in any situation, from everyday wear to professional diving expeditions. omega seamaster 007: the iconic watch of james bond the partnership between omega and the james bond franchise has become one of the most successful and enduring relationships in cinema history. since 1995, the omega seamaster has been the watch of choice for the world's most famous spy, with the omega seamaster 007 editions becoming highly sought-after collector's items. this collaboration has not only elevated the seamaster's profile but has also cemented omega's position as a maker of stylish, yet highly capable timepieces. the omega seamaster first appeared on james bond's wrist in "goldeneye" (1995), marking the beginning of the omega seamaster 007 legacy. pierce brosnan's bond wore a seamaster quartz professional 300m, chosen for its blend of elegance and durability - qualities that perfectly matched 007's character. as the partnership evolved, so did the watches, with each subsequent film featuring new seamaster models that showcased omega's latest innovations in watchmaking technology. when daniel craig took over the role of james bond in "casino royale" (2006), the omega seamaster 007 connection grew even stronger. craig's bond wore both the seamaster diver 300m and the planet ocean, highlighting the versatility of the seamaster line. special edition omega seamaster 007 watches were released alongside each film, featuring unique design elements that paid homage to the bond legacy. these limited editions often incorporated subtle nods to the films, such as the "007" logo on the dial or case back, bullet-shaped decorations, or bond family coat of arms. the most recent omega seamaster 007 watch, created for "no time to die" (2021), exemplifies the evolution of this partnership. this seamaster diver 300m features a lightweight titanium case and bracelet, a vintage-inspired brown aluminum bezel and tropical brown dial, and is powered by omega's co-axial master chronometer movement. it's not just a movie prop, but a fully-fledged professional dive watch that can withstand real-world challenges - much like bond himself. the omega seamaster 007 connection has proven to be a perfect match, blending cinematic allure with horological excellence. sell your omega seamaster at bob's, selling your omega luxury watch is a
