almost 12% last year despite a sagging global economy. questions and answers on how to sell a rolex where can i sell rolex watches near me or online? whether at a location near you or online, there are several ways that you can sell rolex watches. but some are better than others. pawn shops and jewelry stores near you will always offer you very low prices for your rolex watch. this is because of their high overheads and lack of knowledge needed to properly value rolex watches. online can offer you better prices, but you must be weary of the website you choose. craigslist can certainly be dangerous since you have to meet up with a complete stranger with an expensive timepiece in hand. ebay unfortunately doesn’t do enough to protect the sellers and almost always takes the side of the buyer when conflicts arise. this means you could end up with a returned (and damaged) rolex without any reimbursement whatsoever. bob’s watches, on the other hand, is an online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling rolex watches. as the premier online destination for pre-owned rolex watches, we boast a team of rolex trained watchmakers and rolex specialists to ensure a smooth process when

are in high demand, making it easier than ever before to sell your rolex. rolex watches are also popular milestone gifts and are highly sought after purchases for graduations, work anniversaries, and retirements. rolex timepieces are popular year-round, however, selling your rolex during a time of year when the demand is high, such as christmas or graduation season, ensures that you will receive the best possible price. what is required from me to sell my rolex? the more information that you are able to provide when selling your rolex timepiece, the better. a good place to start is by locating your watch’s serial and model numbers. this provides the buyer with important information needed to price your watch. any other documents that you are able to provide, such as sales receipts, warranty papers, and service records are also incredibly helpful as they provide a history of the watch and can help verify its authenticity. the original box and papers can be very valuable in their own right. they let the buyer know that your timepiece is genuine and increase the price that you may receive for your watch. it’s becoming increasingly common for buyers to require the original box and papers upon selling your used rolex, so be sure to keep them in a safe place upon purchasing any rolex timepieces. providing these items when selling your rolex ensures you will receive the highest asking price. finally, any original parts that you have, such as spare bracelet links, can prove to be very valuable to potential rolex buyers. providing as many of the original parts as

online retailer of pre-owned rolex watches, we get many calls each day from people who are looking to "sell a rolex", "sell my rolex", "selling a rolex watch", or even "how to sell my rolex watch".  selling  a pre-owned rolex watch can seem like there is no easy solution.  where do you sell, what is it worth, and who can i trust are just some of the questions that sellers seem to wrestle with. often times, because of our hectic, fast paced lifestyles, it's often easier to just leave it in the top dresser draw or the safety deposit box. most rolex watch owners, rolex submariner owners in particular, are higher net worth folks whose time is valuable.  so here at bob's, we have kept that in mind when we developed a sell rolex program for owners who want to either sell or trade for a different model.  here are a few of the main choices for people looking to sell rolex watch models: list it on ebay list it on craigslist find a local jeweler who may or may not know the real market value send it to bob's watches listing an item like a rolex watch on ebay is not an easy solution. first off, you need an established ebay account and paypal that most private sellers do not have. more importantly, most private sellers are not experienced on how to list the item, how to price it, and then hassle with collecting the money from potentially unethical buyers. craigslist: even if you did know the correct price to sell the watch, do you really want buyers coming to your home to buy your watch? local jewelers: while this is sometimes a fair option for sellers, most regular jewelers will not know the up to date current market value of the watch and will not have the efficient sell marketplace to resell the item.  for these reasons, it is unlikely you will receive the best price for your pre-owned rolex with this option. bob's watches: one of the primary reasons we founded bob's watches was to establish an efficient marketplace with a trusted buyer and seller. since there was such a void in the markeplace for this service, we have enjoyed remarkable success by providing better value for the seller and for the buyer as well.  most people looking to sell rolex watches just want to know what is it worth and what is a fair price i can get for it. that is precisely why at bob's, we show you the price we are buying it for and selling it for right there in black and white. so if you too are asking yourself, where can i sell my rolex watch for the best price, then call bob's watches toll free at 800-494-3708. we make selling rolex timepieces easy and

much forever if you take care of them and are therefore a pretty good investment. rolex sells thousands of new watches through their authorized dealers all over the world and the fact that rolex do last such a long time allows for a huge secondary market. when you buy a rolex, it is not a one owner watch, whether you pass it down to your children and grandchildren or sell it to another person, they usually last through multiple generations. this also allows the values to be very high and if you need money or, just don’t really want or use it you can sell rolex brand watches to us at bob’s watches for great prices. bob's buying goals our goal at bob’s watches is to essentially “pinch” the market. what this means is that we make the margin between how much we buy a watch for and how much we sell it for a lot lower and we even publicly display these two prices on the website. this allows us to buy watches for more than our competitors and sell them for less. often people come to us and ask to sell their watch and upon receiving the price are astounded because many other online retailers sell rolex for around a thousand dollars more than what we offered. why this happens is these retailers run on huge margins of thousands of dollars between how much they buy and sell a watch for and so how much they sell the watch for is really a bloated view of how much it is really worth. when you sell rolexes to bob's watches you get the true value. why bob’s is different we have found this to be an unfair and underhanded practice and so we have tried to make our business transparent
