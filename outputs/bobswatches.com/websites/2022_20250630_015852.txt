(prices of the subs have increased substantially this year alone and are hard to get). it took me two months to decide whether to keep waiting on a list with the local rolex ad to get a new one, until i decided to leap at a pre-owned watch. sarah, the sales rep, guided me through the process without hassles. payment made by wire. it arrived by fed ex insured and in a carefully packaged box with the original. the piece arrived in excellent condition just as advertised. (mint condition is a step above and reserved for unworn or new watches). while i had requested them to fit the bracelet a bit smaller prior to shipping and didn't fit, the watchmaker guided me to put the links back together to make it right. as for the 2019 sub it's a magnificent watch and the pictures don't do it justice. no issues. happy with my purchase.city: guaynaboalex kthank you to alex and team members for a smooth transaction. highly recommend this company, and will be definitely doing business with this company again in the future.city: miami chadenrique was phenomenal! i sold a watch and the process was as promised. i was paid within a day of bob’s receiving my watch. 5 stars!city: melbournekimberlysam in sales was amazing to work with very professional and kindcity: irvine chrisi just wanted to let everyone know that this company is legit. i was very apprehensive about the whole wire transfer situation and actually got cold feet a week prior to ordering and paying for my watch. my bank made me feel like it was a scam but upon doing as much research and footwork as i could finally pulled the trigger and put my trust into the company. long story, pressed but it now, got the transfer info immediately, went to my bank to wire the money to them at about 12pm eastern time. wire was processed by 2:30 fast forward to today at 11:30 am eastern and i had the watch in hand as described and in perfect shape. can’t say enough good things about bob’s but i have 100% trust in their company from here forward. i would give them 10 stars if possible as all of the sales people were very patient with my questions and concerns and the accounting team took the time to answer my calls at the bank to make sure all of the account numbers were correct, i actually called after i left the bank to double check and again they couldn’t have been more patient and kind. thanks again i’m not sure when i will buy my next rolex but when i do i wouldn’t even think about going anywhere else. expectations were blown out of the water.nancythe watch was more beautiful in person, and in excellent shape even though it is 18 years old. customer service was fantastic - i received my watch within 24 hours. i was hesitant to make a purchase online, but glad i did.adileneexcellent customer service.city: kansas city page 1 - page 2 - page 3 - page 4 - page 5 - page 6 - page 7 - page 8 >> showing items 1 - 11 of 337 total (page 1 of 31) bob'sbob's watches reviews and testimonials company about us careers affiliates how we give back press trusted partners bob's watches wikipedia scholarship services & support seller terms & conditions consignor terms contact us faq buying & selling why buy from us authenticity pledge buyers protection plan bob's rolex usa testimonial reviews shipping & returns u.s. shipping international shipping returns warranty bob's watches - the pre-owned rolex exchange subscribe to our newsletter email address: subscribe facebook twitter instagram youtube © 2022 bob's watches privacy · terms · sitemap 1900 quail st • newport beach, ca 92660 mon - fri 9am - 5pm (pst) have a question?
