beretta 92fs magazine, 9mm, stainless steel look, 10rd overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 5 read all user: goingdef date: november 07, 2011 9mm stainless steel body, 10rd review: i just got these in and added my np3 bases to them and they are top notch worth every penny! user: gravi date: september 06, 2011 ca legal, beretta quality review: the good: impeccable function, sturdy construction, easy to load even without a speed loader, and metal base plate - no plastic except the follower. bonus, arrived ahead of schedule :).the bad: matte finish easily scratches/scrapes going in and out of magazine well, but that's a small price to pay. i bought two, maybe a third is in the cards, and i can consider polishing that for grins with my dremel to see if that stands up any better. user: joe in ct date: june 20, 2011 beretta quality redux review: first order i bought 3, which gave me a leo's load: one locked and loaded and 2 in a belt twin mag pouch. since pietro's usa guys and gals found more, i decided to buy 2 more (picture in your mind the guy with the credit card in his right hand and he is fighting to control it!). now i can empty a box of ammo with my stable of ss mags for my 92 inox brig, and maybe take some eye candy pix. they load smoothly, feed crisply, and clean easily. what more can one ask for! user: joe in ct date: june 16, 2011 beretta quality review: look great with my inox brig. one quality took me by surprise; i expected the finish to be more like that on the springfield armory xd mags, whose finish is like ss tableware. the finish on these mags is muted, more like their nickel mag finish. however, they fill nicely, at least with snap caps, and i expect their internal surfaces will be easier to keep clean, versus parkerized black. can't wait to get to the range. user: abby date: april 14, 2011 wish the made it in a 15 round! review: perfect for my 92fs inox bought 2 of them. next will be the nickel mags. beretta bu9 nano magazine 9mm 6rds ss overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 3 read all user: chris date: june 07, 2012 terrific! review: top quality. no problems! two with every pistol. commendation - nicely done! user: sam date: march 08, 2012 reliable and quality magazine review: when i got my nano i figured the the magazine would need something as is my experience with most concealed carry firearms. however the spring and follower work flawlessly and the magazine is much heavier than i expected that it would be. i will definitely only use factory magazines no aftermarket for me. user: goofa date: december 13, 2011 a solid, reliable ccw review: the bu9 nano has been utterly reliable from the moment i loaded its first round. the trigger seems to get smoother with each visit to the range. with just over 300 rounds, it has performed flawlessly with the different brands of ammo i fed it. this pistol is built like a tank and performs much better than i expected. beretta 3901 target rl overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 2 read all user: treefrog date: august 19, 2010 a good small women"s gun review: got one recently for my wife, 5'0" 105 lbs. after adjusting the comb it fit's great. does have a bit of a kick and if they make the recoil reduction system device, optional on this and you got a smaller women going to use it, get it. but she's happy, breaking clay's, having fun and you will too. go ahead, get one. you won't be sorry. user: treefrog date: august 19, 2010 it's a fine gun review: i got one for my wife, 105 lbs-5'0" great fit w/ the reduced length and comb. a little kick, if optional recoil reduction system device was made available, i would of paid for it. she's hitting & happy. (so am i :) beretta 471 silver hawk (pistol grip, beaver tail fore-end) overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: whelenshooter date: july 20, 2011 the shotgun of my dreams! review: i have a pistol gripped 471 silver hawk 12 gauge with 26-inch barrels. it is my pride and joy! although not an inexpensive shotgun, when i saw the craftsmanship that went into building my 471 silverhawk, i wonder how they can produce one for such a low price! the metal appears like it grew out of the wood, and the entire gun exudes quality! it fits wonderfully and feels like an extension of my body whan i shoot it. this shotgun gives me more pride of ownership than any other shotgun i own! i wish i hadn't waited so long before buying one. i love this shotgun! beretta 682 gold e, skeet, adj. stock overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: stubeeef date: may 05, 2012 nothing but pleasure review: i have an original 682 that is now 20 yrs old, and i have no idea how many have owned it before me. i had it rebuilt as it was a bit uncared for when i got it used from a pawn shop. let me tell you-this gun is a sweetheart-mounts clean and straight, fires every time wether or not i feed it cheap or expensive shells and i got my first 25 straight in skeet with it after only my first 30 days. these are coveted shotguns that every old timer has, wants, or wants back. beretta 686 silver pigeon i 12ga overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: bruce date: september 06, 2011 silver pigeon 1 review: bought this gun several weeks ago and have shot 800 rounds at clays. best gun i have ever bought!
