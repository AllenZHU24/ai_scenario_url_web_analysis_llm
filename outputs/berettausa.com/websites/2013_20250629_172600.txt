review: this is a good mag. i also have the sand resistant mags which are great, but overpriced in my opinion. these are a bit cheaper, hold 2 more rounds, and are from beretta. so get the bulk ones for even a couple more bucks cheaper since its just a mag guys. why would i buy the 15s at the same price or the sand resistant for more? also the blued and polished finish on these is very durable they don't scratch easily and look new even after many changes. i don't baby them either. beretta 92fs magazine, 9mm, stainless steel look, 10rd overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 5 read all user: goingdef date: november 07, 2011 9mm stainless steel body, 10rd review: i just got these in and added my np3 bases to them and they are top notch worth every penny! user: gravi date: september 06, 2011 ca legal, beretta quality review: the good: impeccable function, sturdy construction, easy to load even without a speed loader, and metal base plate - no plastic except the follower. bonus, arrived ahead of schedule :).the bad: matte finish easily scratches/scrapes going in and out of magazine well, but that's a small price to pay. i bought two, maybe a third is in the cards, and i can consider polishing that for grins with my dremel to see if that stands up any better. user: joe in ct date: june 20, 2011 beretta quality redux review: first order i bought 3, which gave me a leo's load: one locked and loaded and 2 in a belt twin mag pouch. since pietro's usa guys and gals found more, i decided to buy 2 more (picture in your mind the guy with the credit card in his right hand and he is fighting to control it!). now i can empty a box of ammo with my stable of ss mags for my 92 inox brig, and maybe take some eye candy pix. they load smoothly, feed crisply, and clean easily. what more can one ask for! user: joe in ct date: june 16, 2011 beretta quality review: look great with my inox brig. one quality took me by surprise; i expected the finish to be more like that on the springfield armory xd mags, whose finish is like ss tableware. the finish on these mags is muted, more like their nickel mag finish. however, they fill nicely, at least with snap caps, and i expect their internal surfaces will be easier to keep clean, versus parkerized black. can't wait to get to the range. user: abby date: april 14, 2011 wish the made it in a 15 round! review: perfect for my 92fs inox bought 2 of them. next will be the nickel mags. beretta bu9 nano magazine 9mm 6rds ss overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 3 read all user: chris date: june 07, 2012 terrific! review: top quality. no problems! two with every pistol. commendation - nicely done! user: sam date: march 08, 2012 reliable and quality magazine review: when i got my nano i figured the the magazine would need something as is my experience with most concealed carry firearms. however the spring and follower work flawlessly and the magazine is much heavier than i expected that it would be. i will definitely only use factory magazines no aftermarket for me. user: goofa date: december 13, 2011 a solid, reliable ccw review: the bu9 nano has been utterly reliable from the moment i loaded its first round. the trigger seems to get smoother with each visit to the range. with just over 300 rounds, it has performed flawlessly with the different brands of ammo i fed it. this pistol is built like a tank and performs much better than i expected. beretta "old style" jubilee overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: drew date: july 24, 2013 giubileo review: the best shouldering gun i have ever shot. wonderful with trap. looking forward to dove season. beretta 1301 competition overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: jadeslade date: march 21, 2014 1301 comp review review: the best off the shelf competition 3gun shotgun ever. 21" model transitions extremely well. it is accurate, mounts very fast, and works extremely well and fast. loads quickly with out of abc chamfer on loading port. chokes are available in extended version. awesome! beretta 3901 target rl overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 3 read all user: savannah date: october 27, 2012 i am in love..... review: why beretta isn't making this shotguns a mystery to me. i found one new this month and have put about 300 rounds through it. i love this shotgun. i am an average height female but apparently i have a short lop and long neck. all of the adjustments have made this 12 gauge perfect. i highly recommend it for anyone who has a smaller or shorter lop. such a nicely made gun. user: treefrog date: august 19, 2010 a good small women"s gun review: got one recently for my wife, 5'0" 105 lbs. after adjusting the comb it fit's great. does have a bit of a kick and if they make the recoil reduction system device, optional on this and you got a smaller women going to use it, get it. but she's happy, breaking clay's, having fun and you will too. go ahead, get one. you won't be sorry. user: treefrog date: august 19, 2010 it's a fine gun review: i got one for my wife, 105 lbs-5'0" great fit w/ the reduced length and comb. a little kick, if optional recoil reduction system device was made available, i would of paid for it. she's hitting & happy. (so am i :) beretta 471 silver hawk (english stock, splinter fore-end) overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: jdrvapours date: september 29, 2012 field side by side review: light weight, quick handling, but still light recoil felt. beautiful to hold, tight fit and finish, a work of art; a sensuous sleek feel to the english stock, like an italian model's leg... beretta 471 silver hawk (pistol grip, beaver tail fore-end) overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 2 read all user: jdrvapours date: september 29, 2012 471/20ga/28/english review: ultralight, sleek, fast to mount, fast to target, surprisingly light recoil. beautiful to contemplate; demands admiration for the design and workmanship. the stock has a sensuous feel from shin to ankle, like a well oiled leg.... user: whelenshooter date: july 20, 2011 the shotgun of my dreams! review: i have a pistol gripped 471 silver hawk 12 gauge with 26-inch barrels. it is my pride and joy! although not an inexpensive shotgun, when i saw the craftsmanship that went into building my 471 silverhawk, i wonder how they can produce one for such a low price! the metal appears like it grew out of the wood, and the entire gun exudes quality! it fits wonderfully and feels like an extension of my body whan i shoot it. this shotgun gives me more pride of ownership than any other shotgun i own! i wish i hadn't waited so long before buying one. i love this shotgun! beretta 680 gold e o&u barrel 12 ga, 30", 3" trap optimachoke overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: redleg date: january 16, 2013 love the barrels! review: bought as a complement to the 32" sporting barrels my 682 gold e came with. has the same tapered rib so sight picture didn't change. barrels pattern 50/50 which is good for most activities. optima barrels are lighter than the mobile barrels i have on an earlier 682. i prefer the optima barrels for tube sets which gets the weight right for sub-gauge shooting. they are a little light for me for dedicated trap shooting, but i didn't buy them for that. beretta 682 gold e vest - black overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 1 read all user: fred date: august 09, 2013 vest with recoil pad review: great price, fit and style. recoil pad is about 1/4" thick and does not effect holding the gun. beretta 682 gold e, skeet, adj. stock overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 2 read all user: merbeau date: july 28, 2013 built for competition review: i have an older s682 that i purchased in 1992 for use in skeet competition. i broke my first 25 and 100 with this shotgun. still going strong. the older model 682s were heavier because of barrel weight. the new models are lighter because of less barrel weight. if you purchase the 30 or 32 inch barrel in the newer gun the feeling is the same. user: stubeeef date: may 05, 2012 nothing but pleasure review: i have an original 682 that is now 20 yrs old, and i have no idea how many have owned it before me. i had it rebuilt as it was a bit uncared for when i got it used from a pawn shop. let me tell you-this gun is a sweetheart-mounts clean and straight, fires every time wether or not i feed it cheap or expensive shells and i got my first 25 straight in skeet with it after only my first 30 days. these are coveted shotguns that every old timer has, wants, or wants back. beretta 686 silver pigeon i 12ga overall rating: 5 number of reviews: 5 read all user: gs b date: december 28, 2013 amazing! review: the best all round 12 gauge. goes from range to hunt in a heartbeat. nothing beats the silver pigeon. only wish they still made the side-by- sides, would love to get one of those as well. user: mrdon date: july 14, 2013 amazing shotgun perfection review: i shoot a lot of trap i have this in a 32' and it's perfection. i have over a thousand rounds thru this and it still like the day i bought it. i would highly recommend this to anyone seeking a quality shotgun for skeet/trap or clays user: ken nersesian date: march 05, 2013 awesome review: i absolutely love this gun! will be getting it in 20 ga. too. only gripe, to upgrade to a ll or lll, the added cost is excessive. only difference is slightly better wood and different engraving. same gun otherwise. an extra $1000 to upgrade from a spl to a spll is just too much. $500 maybe, not $1000. user: chuck s date: january 13, 2013 i own one review: it's light and works great. it doesn't hurt that it looks good too! i'm happy with my purchase. user: bruce date: september 06, 2011 silver pigeon 1 review: bought this gun several weeks ago and have shot 800 rounds at clays. best gun i have ever bought! fit is perfect and my scores have already increased by 10. beretta is the only b for me... join our newsletter sign up to receive enews from beretta to get special sales, new product developments and select beretta news beretta store men's clothing | women's clothing | shooting gear | gun accessories | sale | customer service | my account google + twitter btrident facebook youtube pinterest store e-commerce dealer locator firearms upland waterfowl clay shooting self defense premium guns tactical over and under semi automatics handguns clothing & accessories clay shooting men women since 1526 today history careers service media center dealer login faq community videos warranty registration blog facebook bdt military law enforcement ©| site designed and developed by americaneagle.com | site map | terms & conditions | privacy policy | contact us
