(you don't have to know whether your browser supports secure transactions - if it doesn't, you won't be able to complete the checkout process.) which parts of abt.com are secure? all of abt.com is secured using ssl encryption. this ensures that your credit card number and personal information are never sent over the internet unencrypted. your credit card information is immediately stored in its encrypted form in the data center. once it is encrypted, no one except the credit card authorization company can decrypt it. your credit card number is never displayed on our site. only the last four digits will ever be shown. also, your personal information, such as your address, e-mail and billing information, are stored in a secure server within the data center. only those with proper authorization can view this data. we guarantee it. does abt use cookies? yes.
