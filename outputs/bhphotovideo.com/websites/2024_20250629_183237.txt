started as the quintessential small business—a mom and pop shop—and even though we have grown into an industry leader, we still adhere to the precepts our success was built on: customer service, education (for salespeople as well as consumers), extensive inventory and amazing prices. what's more, we are committed to the ongoing success of small businesses everywhere. we are enthusiastically dedicated to establishing associations with vendors of all sizes and stripes, including: women-owned small businesses hubzone small businesses small disadvantaged businesses veteran-owned small businesses service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses if your company is a supplier offering products or services that you believe would be beneficial to b&h and our customers, we'd love to hear from you. feel free to contact our small business liaison office at [email protected]. pricing policy why no price? from time to time, we enter into minimum advertised price (map) agreements with select suppliers in order to pass along certain benefits to our customers. according to these agreements (details vary from vendor to vendor) we can sell an item for any price, but we may not advertise that item for an amount less than the minimum advertised price, which is set by the supplier. in exchange, we get advance notice about newly released products and early shipments, as well as favored status with the world's best brands. while we abide by our map agreements, we always ensure that you pay the lowest price. payment verification occasionally we may ask you to verify that you're the card owner or that order and ship-to information are legitimate. this verification process is for your protection, rarely delays an order, and generally requires either a simple phone call (which can be done after business hours) or fax communication. if your order requires verification, we will advise you by phone or email. this is why it's important that you provide multiple contact phone numbers when ordering and that you keep your information current. it is also important that you understand what we mean by bill-to information on the checkout process. the bill-to address is the address to which your bank mails your monthly credit card statement. the bill-to address you give us must agree with the address that the card-issuing bank has on file. please be sure you provide the correct information, even if the items are to be shipped to a different location. we regret that they are even occasionally necessary, but these steps are designed to safeguard against credit card fraud and identity theft. sales tax local sales tax: when an order is shipped within new york state, the law requires that local sales tax be added to the order total, including any shipping charges. purchases in our store are subject to an 8.875% local sales tax. this tax is not a vat and cannot be recovered by non-usa visitors when returning home. if your order is shipping to an address in a state which requires local sales tax collection on remote purchases, or is being picked up in our manhattan superstore, local sales tax will be automatically collected unless the account is registered as tax-exempt. in some cases, we may provide an estimated sales tax amount until your exact location is finalized prior to order completion. important information for residents of puerto rico: we are legally required to report certain purchases to local taxation departments. please check with your local government to see if your purchases are subject to a use tax. tax exemptions government, education, nonprofit organizations, public charities, churches and other religious organizations usually qualify for tax-exempt purchases. once approved, customers may make tax-exempt purchases on behalf of their organizations online. to apply for a tax-exempt account, click here. apply for tax exempt status click here for information about sales tax / tax exemptions b&h warranty/imported/grey market products what is a b&h warranty item? items labeled with a b&h warranty are imported or grey market products that are being sold outside of the manufacturer's intended sales region. products obtained from sources other than the manufacturer or its licensed importer are "grey market" products. grey market is not illegal, not factory seconds, not demo merchandise, not cheaper or inferior quality. in fact, in almost every instance, a grey market product is absolutely identical to its usa-warranted counterpart. grey market and usa-warranted products are manufactured in the same factories, from the same components and sub-assemblies, to the same specs and tolerances, and by the same workers. in terms of the items themselves, there is no difference at all. for example: a grey market nikon 50mm f/1.4 d-af lens is exactly the same in every possible way as a usa-warranted version. you may see such items also described as "imported" or "grey market" or "international." why does b&h sell imported items? product availability — by selling imported items, we're able to offer items that may currently be unavailable directly from manufacturers. what are the key differences between imported and regular items? imported items are not warranted by the manufacturer and, instead, come with a limited warranty from b&h. additionally, these items are not eligible for rebates or promotional offers from the manufacturer. are grey market items eligible for manufacturer repair if damaged and out of warranty period? while each manufacturer is different, many manufacturers do not provide an option for repair on items that are labelled as grey market merchandise. are there any other differences? typically, there are no other major differences in how the items function. there may be some slight changes to how the menu system is organized, which languages are set as default, or the literature included with the item. functionally, the items are the same. what are b&h's warranty terms? we cover all manufacturing defects. duration varies based on the item. please see the product page and locate the "in the box" section for duration of coverage. typically this will match the manufacturer's standard warranty. who do i contact for warranty service? contact b&h customer service for any service questions. can i purchase an extended warranty on grey market items that come with a b&h warranty? yes. customers can purchase an extended warranty in the exact same way as they would with an item with a standard manufacturer's warranty. privacy & security privacy and
