however, in 2013 apple introduced a complete redesign. now available in a unique cylinder form factor, the mac pro stands just under 10 inches tall, and just over 6.5 inches in diameter. its smaller footprint allows users to place them directly on their desks, while still providing next-gen components to usher in emerging technologies, such as 4k. come see how mac desktops have evolved over the years. editor's note: this post was written by william min sam mallery's blog 2 read more b&h gear news roundup: december 13, 2013 by sam mallery on 12-13-2013 this week in the news: zeiss confirmed that a new otus 85mm f/1.4 lens was in the works;
