payment estimator why lease? leasing is a practical and cost-effective way to acquire the latest technology and equipment. leasing provides affordable monthly payments with flexible terms and can be structured to match the cash flow needs of your business. your lease may be structured so you own the equipment at the end of the lease. alternatively, you can return the equipment to the leasing company at lease termination with no further obligation. leasing allows easy upgrades to newer technology during the lease. leasing offers important tax advantages, and your lease payment may even be fully tax deductible (check with your tax advisor). arranging your lease is easy with simple documentation and quick turnaround. what type of leases are available? payment terms can be conveniently spread out over terms as long as 60 months. when you start the lease, you will have a choice of end-of-lease buyout payments to select. at the end of the lease, if you make the buyout payment, you can keep the equipment, it's yours! alternatively, if you don't want to make the buyout payment, you can return the equipment to the leasing company at the end of the lease with no further obligation. your choice of the buyout payment, along with the length of the lease, will affect your monthly payments. the end-of-lease buyout options are fair market value (fmv), 10% of original purchase price, and "bargain purchase" (typically $1 or $101) buyout. for any given lease term, the fmv lease will result in the lowest monthly payment. higher payments will be incurred with the 10% and bargain purchase buyout leases. what monthly payment can i expect?
