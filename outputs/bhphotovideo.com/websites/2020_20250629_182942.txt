quintessential small business—a mom and pop shop—and even though we have grown into an industry leader, we still adhere to the precepts our success was built on: customer service, education (for salespeople as well as consumers), extensive inventory and amazing prices. what's more, we are committed to the ongoing success of small businesses everywhere. we are enthusiastically dedicated to establishing associations with vendors of all sizes and stripes, including: women-owned small businesses hubzone small businesses small disadvantaged businesses veteran-owned small businesses service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses if your company is a supplier offering products or services that you believe would be beneficial to b&h and our customers, we'd love to hear from you. feel free to contact our small business liaison office at [email protected]. pricing policy why no price? from time to time, we enter into minimum advertised price (map) agreements with select suppliers in order to pass along certain benefits to our customers. according to these agreements (details vary from vendor to vendor) we can sell an item for any price, but we may not advertise that item for an amount less than the minimum advertised price, which is set by the supplier. in exchange, we get advance notice about newly released products and early shipments, as well as favored status with the world's best brands. while we abide by our map agreements, we always ensure that you pay the lowest price. payment verification occasionally we may ask you to verify that you're the card owner or that order and ship-to information are legitimate. this verification process is for your protection, rarely delays an order, and generally requires either a simple phone call (which can be done after business hours) or fax communication. if your order requires verification, we will advise you by phone or email. this is why it's important that you provide multiple contact phone numbers when ordering and that you keep your information current. it is also important that you understand what we mean by bill-to information on the checkout process. the bill-to address is the address to which your bank mails your monthly credit card statement. the bill-to address you give us must agree with the address that the card-issuing bank has on file. please be sure you provide the correct information, even if the items are to be shipped to a different location. we regret that they are even occasionally necessary, but these steps are designed to safeguard against credit card fraud and identity theft. sales tax local sales tax: when an order is shipped within new york state, the law requires that local sales tax be added to the order total, including any shipping charges. purchases in our store are subject to an 8.875% local sales tax. this tax is not a vat and cannot be recovered by non-usa visitors when returning home. if your order is shipping to an address in a state which requires local sales tax collection on remote purchases, or is being picked up in our manhattan superstore, local sales tax will be automatically collected unless the account is registered as tax-exempt. in some cases, we may provide an estimated sales tax amount until your exact location is finalized prior to order completion. important information for residents of puerto rico: we are legally required to report certain purchases to local taxation departments. please check with your local government to see if your purchases are subject to a use tax. tax exemptions government, education, nonprofit organizations, public charities, churches and other religious organizations usually qualify for tax-exempt purchases. once approved, customers may make tax-exempt purchases on behalf of their organizations online. to apply for a tax-exempt account, click here. apply for tax exempt status click here for information about sales tax / tax exemptions usa grey market products what are grey market products? most products we carry are covered under warranty from the manufacturer or from a manufacturer's licensed importer. we may also sell some products obtained from sources other than the manufacturer or its licensed importer—these are "grey market" products. grey market is not illegal, not factory seconds, not demo merchandise, not cheaper or inferior quality. in fact, in almost every instance, a grey market product is absolutely identical to its usa-warranted counterpart. grey market items are manufactured in the same factories from the same components and sub-assemblies, to the same specs and tolerances, by the same workers, as their usa-warranted counterparts. in terms of the item itself (excepting pal video; see below) there is no difference at all. the terms "grey market", "direct import" and "imported" refer to the same thing. for example: a grey market nikon 50mm f/1.4 d-af lens is exactly the same in every possible way as a usa-warranted version. what are the differences for me, the customer? in most cases the difference between a usa product and a grey market or imported product is the cost of the item and the terms of its warranty coverage. the products themselves are otherwise identical. as a rule, grey market items cost less than their usa counterparts. grey market products never qualify for manufacturer's rebate programs. what kind of warranty is available? for imp items only, b&h provides a warranty identical to the provisions and limitations of the manufacturer's warranty for such items, with the exception of the time period, which is equal to the term of the manufacturer's warranty or one (1) year, whichever is less. your dated b&h sales receipt is all you need to obtain warranty coverage from b&h for a grey market product purchased from us. should you experience a problem with a usa-warranted product, it can be sent to any of the manufacturer's authorized service facilities for servicing (and some even to any worldwide authorized service facility, depending on the brand). a "direct import" or grey market item would have to be returned to b&h if it required in-warranty service. for film cameras, lenses and speedlights, a product with a usa warranty should be reciprocally warranted by the manufacturer's service centers worldwide. a resident of the usa may wish to make the buying decision based on price since the cost of shipping to a us service center or to b&h should be about equal. a non-usa resident should consider the cost of returning a product to b&h in new york for servicing as opposed to the cost of taking the product to a local warranty service center. why offer "direct import"? direct import or grey market items often cost less than comparable usa imports. there are also items sold at b&h that are not otherwise available in the usa through normal distribution channels. pal (phase alternate line) video equipment video equipment sold in the usa, canada, mexico and japan is designed to record and play back video images at 525 lines-per-frame at 60 frames-per-second. this is commonly known as an ntsc format (national television standards committee). b&h also sells video equipment that is set to record and play back video using the european broadcast standard (pal) of 625 lines-per-frame at 50 frames-per-second. pal and ntsc are not interchangeable recording formats. any video equipment we sell that's designed to record video in the european (pal) format is only available in the usa as grey market and as such does not include a factory-authorized warranty. for pal-format video products, b&h includes a 90-day warranty. what about film? we also sell film from both usa and grey market channels. there is no difference between the imaging qualities of similar film stocks. pricewise, the grey market products cost less than their usa counterparts. * imported - film made outside the usa and imported for us. this may also be referred to as grey. * usa - film manufactured in the usa or overseas and imported for domestic distribution. smartphones some smartphone manufacturers do not distribute new, factory-unlocked smartphones in the usa, so we import them from countries where they are sold. all grey market phones are brand new and factory unlocked. our grey market smartphones are backed by a 1-year b&h warranty. these devices may be set to a foreign language menu by default, requiring the user to manually select their desired language in the smartphone's settings. likewise, the included manual may also be in a different language. many manufacturers offer the option of downloading manuals directly from their websites, with multiple language options. while these devices are designed for global use, the included ac adapter is specific to its intended region. it is recommended that customers purchase an ac adapter that is compatible with their own region's power requirements. if you have any questions regarding our grey market smartphones, please feel free to contact our sales or customer service departments. privacy & security privacy and security b&h foto & electronics corp - web privacy policy. version effective january
