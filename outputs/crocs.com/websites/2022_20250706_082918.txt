a hype commerce platform used to manage the launches of high heat products. eql prevents sites from crashing, slows down scammers and delivers a launch that is run fair. what does run fair mean? we believe that everyone should have a fair chance of getting their hands on the products they love, that‚Äôs why we partnered with eql. they‚Äôve built fairness in: only humans can enter draws: every entry goes through a multi-step security verification process that confirms you are a human. one entry per person: entries are deduplicated against unique identification tags. launches are always secure: best in class security protocols make sure your information is always safe and secure. it should be simple to enter: once you have a verified eql account, entering becomes a breeze. when you see the ‚Äòrun fair‚Äô logo, it‚Äôs a fairness certification. it means the technology used and the steps taken to run the launch are of the highest standard. what are the steps required to enter a draw on eql go to an eql powered draw form. create an eql account provide shipping and payment details verify your entry submit your entry is now registered in the draw. am i charged for entering a draw? no. you are only charged if you are successfully selected at the close of the draw. am i charged for winning a draw? if you are entering a free giveaway, you will not be charged any fees or costs associated to the giveaway, regardless of your selection as a winner or non-winner. if you are a winner, your products will be shipped to you by the retailer free of charge to your specified shipping address. how do i know if i‚Äôve won? you will be alerted via email after the draw has closed. why do you need my credit card details when i enter? credit card details help eql to confirm that you are a real human. it also allows for fraud checks to be done on your card. it‚Äôs a robust security measure so that we can deliver a fair draw for everyone. providing your credit card details is one of the many important steps that confirms your spot in the draw. does submitting an entry via an eql form guarantee me the win? no. it does however guarantee you an entry into the draw and a fair chance to win. if i submit my entry and change my mind later, is there a chance to withdraw? yes. head back to the launch page and you should see a red button that says ‚Äòcancel my entry‚Äô, click that and you‚Äôre now out of the draw. if i win the draw, can i change my mind and withdraw? verified entries are binding. once an entry is confirmed, you have agreed to purchase the product if you win. once a win is allocated to a successful draw entrant the product is no longer available for other customers to buy. bv you purchase the product directly from crocs the transaction agreement is made between the draw winner and crocs. can i enter a draw for the same product multiple times? we want everyone to have a fair chance of getting their hands on products they love. more hyped goods in the hands of more people make everyone feel great. so, only one entry per person per product. that‚Äôs the way a fair draw should be run. didn‚Äôt find what you were looking for?
