website and travel elsewhere on the internet, we may use the cookie to recognize you as someone who has visited our website, to assume that you are interested in our products, and to deliver an advertisement to you that promotes our products. although we may work with a vendor to deliver and read our first-party cookies and to serve advertisements on our behalf, our vendors may not use these first-party cookies to recognize you as someone who may be interested in the goods/services of the vendors’ other clients. you can opt out of first-party advertising by clicking here. when you do, we will deliver an “opt-out” cookie to your browser. when you visit our website in the future, the opt-out cookie will tell us that you have opted out of crocs’ cookies for first-party targeted
