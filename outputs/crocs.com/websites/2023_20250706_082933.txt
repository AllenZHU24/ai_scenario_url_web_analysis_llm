comfortable in their own shoes we‚Äôre committed to reducing our environmental footprint, uplifting our communities, and creating a welcoming environment for everyone, rooted in a culture of

bio-based material into our shoes. comfort for our communities donating shoes, funds, and volunteer hours to global communities and in times of need through our crocs cares program. comfort for all people ensuring crocs welcomes all one-of-a-kinds while creating a comfortable workplace through progressive people-practices. comfort for the planet our shoe of the future we are pioneering the use of bio-based croslite‚Ñ¢ material developed in partnership with dow, using their ecolibrium‚Ñ¢ technology to transform bio-circular waste and by-products into a shoe that has all the comfort you expect from crocs, but with less emissions*. by 2030, we will achieve 50% bio-based content** within our croslite‚Ñ¢ compounds 100% of our bio-based resin is iscc plus certified *bio-circular croslite‚Ñ¢ material has a lower carbon footprint than standard fossil fuel-based croslite‚Ñ¢ material. ** as a result of our mass balance approach, the amount of bio-based content per shoe fluctuates. already low footprint our inherently simple approach to design, the materials we use, and how our shoes are manufactured mean that our classic clog already has a low carbon footprint*. we intend to lower it even more, by focusing on innovating materials and creating efficiencies throughout our value chain. *this metric was calculated using the higg product module 1.0 at higg.org in 2021. calculations were conducted internally and represent a cradle-to-grave impact. all crocs footwear carbon footprints are calculated using industry recognized sample sizes across our product classifications. bags & boxes one of the biggest ways we reduce the impact of our packaging is to limit using shoe boxes where possible because our shoes are durable and generally lightweight (and yes, incredibly stylish). we‚Äôre taking that effort one step further by transitioning all of our global product polybags to 100% post-industrial recycled content. and we‚Äôll continue to work on innovative packaging solutions that use more recycled materials and consider reuse opportunities. more than 80% of our shoes are sold without a shoe box still 100% vegan since 2021, we‚Äôve eliminated all animal derived materials from our products. we are a proud winner of peta‚Äôs 2022 libby award. old crocs. new life. we love the idea of giving our shoes a second life. within a circular economy,
