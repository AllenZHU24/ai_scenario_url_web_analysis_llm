an atv winches are your ticket for going big and getting back out without calling for a tow truck. whether you need a recovery winch for a polaris atv, honda rancher, or arctic cat prowler, you have two choices for cable: steel or synthetic. steel cable has a longer history in the offroad world and is respected for its durability in rugged conditions. although synthetic rope is newer to the offroad industry (originally used for marine purposes), the benefits of synthetic are gaining popularity fast. steel cable the cheapest route for outfitting your atv winch with cable is to choose steel. synthetic rope is slightly more expensive. steel cable holds up well under abrasion, which comes in handy for yard work, landscaping, forestry, and other utility work. some offroaders are only familiar with steel cable, and they choose to stick with what they know. as long as safe winching techniques are used—such as dampening the winch line with a heavy coat or blanket, standing off to the side of the cable when it is under tension, and asking bystanders to clear the area—an atv recovery winch with steel cable is safe and reliable for winching under tough conditions. synthetic rope synthetic rope was originally used in the marine industry, where it held up remarkably well under harsh exposure to the elements at sea. now synthetic rope is available for atv recovery winches, and the benefits are numerous. one of the biggest draws for synthetic line is safety. unlike steel cable, which can backlash if broken, synthetic rope stores very little energy and rarely causes damage if it breaks. synthetic rope is easy on the hands—no more frays or burrs that tear up your skin. synthetic rope floats in water and is much lighter in weight than steel cable. plus, if it breaks, you can easily splice the rope and continue winching with your atv recovery winch. although an atv winch with synthetic rope costs more than one with steel cable, the unique benefits make up for the difference in price. by purchasing a promark offroad product, you have acknowledged that you have read and agree with our "terms of use". *free shipping applies to lower 48 contiguous united states only. © 2013 promark offroad all rights reserved. categories holiday deals atv winches truck / jeep winches trailer winches winch mounting plates winch accessories jeep accessories atv / utv accessories atv / utv snow plows replacement winch parts snowmobile accessories promark offroad swag information home 100% guarantee cancellation / return policy shipping faq about us terms of use privacy site map contact customer service watch us on youtube join us on facebook search terms advanced search contact us
