thanks for the purchase! you will receive an email from our shipping company with the tracking number and the estimated time of arrival. the email will be sent to the email address you provided at time of checkout / payment. please watch for the email, as these emails sometimes end up in spam inboxes. q: do i need a winch mount and/or roller fairlead plate? not all of our winches come with a roller fairlead plate. please check the included accessories in each product description for details. a fairlead mounting plate is required in order to mount the roller fairlead to the winch. if you order a mount that is designed specifically for your vehicle, there will be a fairlead mount built into the plate. a mounting kit is recommended for securing the winch to your vehicle. if you choose not to purchase a mounting kit, it is imperative that your winch be secured to a flat mounting location. please be aware that your winch may not be able to be operated safely without some of the equipment included in the kit. q: can these winches hold hoisted weight? our winches are not designed to be used as a hoist because they are made with dynamic brakes (versus a mechanical brake). a dynamic brake uses the gears in the winch to provide resistance, acting as a brake. but if there is enough force on the winch cable, the line can still "bleed" or be pulled out, which is why a hoist system is not recommended. hoist winches use a mechanical brake, which is a physical brake that locks the spool into place so that there is no line bleed. q: are the winches labeled ‘waterproof’ really waterproof winches? yes, the motor is waterproof. please keep in mind that the cable is not waterproof and will more than likely rust with extended exposure to water if not properly maintained. q: do you ship to alaska and hawaii? yes! we now offer shipping to alaska and hawaii. for more details, see our shipping page. q: how much to ship to canada? unfortunately, we are not able to offer shipping to canada at this time. q: do you ship overseas?
