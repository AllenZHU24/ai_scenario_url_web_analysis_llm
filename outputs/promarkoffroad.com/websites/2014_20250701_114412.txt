grid list sort by position price more info how to choose an atv winch: synthetic or steel cable? atv winches are your ticket for going big and getting back out without calling for a tow truck. now that you’ve purchased an atv and are ready to do some offroading on rugged trails, make sure you are prepared. to get the most from your atv winch, take some time to familiarize yourself with the operations manual. and no matter how much experience you think you have, it never hurts to review the safety features and warnings before you start. after you finish looking through the owner’s manual and safety points, practice towing with your winch. try towing something before you get stuck in ten feet of mud to make sure that everything works right. above all, use caution and have patience when you’re using your atv winch and all should go smoothly. winch line when buying an atv winch, you want to find out the line pull rating. this number is a combination of the tensile strength of the line on the drum and the mechanical capacity of the winch. essentially, it’s how much can your line pull before it snaps back at you. usually, an atv won't be pulling too much weight, so head over to our 1500 lbs winches, or check out other options all the way up to 5,000 lbs.to find out the pull rating you’ll need, measure your atv’s gross vehicle weight (gvw), which is a total of the vehicle, accessories, cargo and passengers. after that, multiply the figure by 1.5 to figure the minimum pull rating of your new winch. on top of strength, you’re going to want to consider line length. many atvers prefer to keep their line short so they don’t have a tangled mess at the end of the day. but others like the fact that the line can reach so far from the drum. if you aren’t quite sure what you want, you can buy some splicing tools so you can extend your cable if you need it, and leave it be if you don’t. atv winch cable options whether you need a recovery winch for a polaris atv, honda rancher, or arctic cat prowler, you have two choices for cable: steel or synthetic. steel cable has a longer history in the offroad world and is respected for its durability in rugged conditions. although synthetic rope is newer to the offroad industry (originally used for marine purposes), the benefits of synthetic are gaining popularity fast. steel cable the most affordable route for outfitting your atv winch with cable is to choose steel. synthetic rope is slightly more expensive. steel cable holds up well under abrasion, which comes in handy for yard work, landscaping, forestry, and other utility work. some offroaders are only familiar with steel cable, and they choose to stick with what they know. as long as safe winching techniques are used—such as dampening the winch line with a heavy coat or blanket, standing off to the side of the cable when it is under tension, and asking bystanders to clear the area—an atv recovery winch with steel cable is safe and reliable for winching under tough conditions. synthetic rope atv synthetic rope was originally used in the marine industry, where it held up remarkably well under harsh exposure to the elements at sea. now synthetic rope is available for atv recovery winches, and the benefits are numerous. one of the biggest draws for synthetic line is safety. unlike steel cable, which can backlash if broken, synthetic rope stores very little energy and rarely causes damage if it breaks. synthetic rope is easy on the hands—no more frays or burrs that tear up your skin. synthetic rope floats in water and is much lighter in weight than steel cable. plus, if it breaks, you can easily splice the rope and continue winching with your atv recovery winch. although an atv winch with synthetic rope costs more than one with steel cable, the unique benefits make up for the difference in price. winch motors most atv winch motors are electric. in a normal winch, the motor powers the reduction gear mechanism, which winds the winch cable around the drum. when the winch motor is stopped or if there is a load on the wire rope, an automatic winch brake will engage on the drum. a clutch disengages the break from the drivetrain, allowing the drum to once again rotate. most winches also come with accessories that let you distance yourself from the heavy lifting, either through an electrical control pad or a remote control. winch mounting you don’t want to just throw your atv winch onto the back of your atv and call it good to go. first, you’ll need to install atv mounting plates. what type of mounting plate you should buy depends on the make and model of your atv - of course you can always make some modifications yourself. you can either set them on the front or the back, depending on the type of towing or hauling you’ll be doing. there are plenty of options in atv winch mounts, but make sure your mounting device can withstand the pressure from your line pull rating and your gvw. check your owner’s manual to see whether your manufacturer carries any winch mounting plates or accessories. next, you need to get out your tool box and bolt the mounting plate to your atv. make sure your pull line isn’t obstructed by anything like the handlebars or spotlights, and has a clear path to operate. then, you simply wire your winch to it’s contactor relay box, which can be mounted wherever is comfortable. finally, mount your winch control switches near the steering column for easy access. just connect all this to the battery, and you’re ready to ride! how to use an atv winch once you get the atv winch installed, you’re going to want to see how it works. it’s pretty easy. feed the cable out so you can access enough to connect the trapped vehicle to the line. on the end of the winch cable is a metal connector hook with an automatic locking mechanism to keep you and your vehicles safe. secure that to the stuck vehicle. once the line is in place and you’ve tightened the slack, you can engage the winch by using the control pad on your steering column, or a remote from a safer distance. and, look at that. you’ve dragged that poor vehicle out of the muck and it’s back on its way. remember not to stand too close to the winch, because something like loose clothing or hair could get pulled in and trapped. always remember to keep your wits about you and maintain safe practices when operating an atv winch. make sure to take care of your atv so you can avoid heavy duty winch maintenance. by purchasing a promark offroad product, you have acknowledged that you have read and
