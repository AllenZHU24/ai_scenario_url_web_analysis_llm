resource locator ("url") that you just came from, which url you next go to, what browser you are using, and your internet protocol ("ip") address. a url is the global address of documents and other resources on the world wide web. an ip address is an identifier for a computer or device on a transmission control protocol/internet protocol ("tcp/ip") network, such as the world wide web. networks like the web use the tcp/ip protocol to route information based on the ip address of the destination. in other words, an ip address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. computers require ip addresses in order for users to communicate on the internet, browse and shop. when you order
