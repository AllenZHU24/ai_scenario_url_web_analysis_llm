tucker c. it manager industry: auto dealership discount electronics has proven to be a solid and cost-effective solution for our technological needs. eugene has provided excellent and timely customer service throughout the ordering and support processes. our firm will continue to use discount electronics as our operations and technological needs expand. noah v. it manager industry: lawfirm quality dell systems with superior service. even with the hazards of cross-country shipping, discount electronics has stood behind their products with 100% customer satisfaction. when an upgrade is needed, the correct parts arrive in a timely fashion. when i mis-order something, my discount electronics rep (eugene terrell) will call me back within minutes to clarify. pricing is very good and the equipment performs beautifully. stephen w. chief technology officer industry: transportation & logistics i am writing to recommend the services and products offered by discountelectronics.com. our school district has been ordering parts from them since 2014. with funding for education being reduced in the state of indiana, we haven’t had the luxury of replacing our computers on a reasonable cycle. we were forced to look for alternative ways to keep technology moving forward in our district. discount electronics worked with us to open a credit account which allowed us to continue using our current purchase order process. that, along with their very reasonable prices, fast turnaround times and streamlined paperwork process, has allowed us to keep our computers functioning without extended down times, within budget, and with efficiency. therefore i am happy to recommend the services and products of discountelectronics.com. jana m. technology projects coordinator industry: k-12 education i felt it is necessary that i take a moment from my business schedule and reflect on the ongoing relationship we have with discount electronic during this current 2015-2016 school year. for starters, we are very pleased with the level of attention and service eugene terrell gives us here at buena vista. he has demonstrated an uncanny ability to go above and beyond normal service to insure that we receive the utmost care for our technological purchases. due to demographics restraint for our school district and the remote location in which buena vista resides it has been difficult for many previous vendors to give us the beneficial research and attention needed for our district to make cost efficient and calculated purchases. from laptops to promethean equipment, to simple technological brainstorming of ideas and/or advice, eugene has been an important asset that provides prompt responses, fair market pricing, product comparisons and in-depth knowledge which has bridged the gap to keep our technology department abreast on the latest innovation that can best help our staff and school district. we are grateful for the continued support and business and look forward to our future endeavors with mr. terrell and discount electronics. david w. technology director industry: k-12 education i was pretty skeptical about how inexpensive their equipment is, so i made a small purchase (usff desktop computer with monitor) to check the quality, but was very pleased when i received my items. i was able to receive them the next day and they took much care when packaging all of my items. customer service is probably one of the most important factors in continuing to work with any vendor and eugene terrell has taken great care of me and my company so now i’m a regular shopper at discount electronics. please feel free to contact me if you would like any more information regarding my experience with discount electronics. scott. k it manager industry: auto finance i am pleased to express my satisfaction with the level of service provided to us by discount electronics. a company may have a good product to sell but what makes that product great is the level of service and support after the sale. i would rate discount electronics 5 out of 5 stars for their level of service and support during and after the purchasing process. our sales representative does an outstanding job at facilitating the process for purchases or exchanges. email or phone inquiries are always addressed in a timely manner. it is this high level of services that has made my company a repeat customer with discount electronics. thank you!
