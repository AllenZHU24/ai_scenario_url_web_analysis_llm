welcome to aafes diversity at aafes, diversity is not just the right thing to do; it is a clear business advantage. mg keith l. thurgood, aafes commander states, “our diversity defines our strengths and creates opportunity for growth,” diversity is an opportunity that has long been an integral part of the aafes mission. in fact, diversity is so critical to aafes’ success that it is incorporated into one of the five strategic goals – “build a culture of loyalty, ownership, sustainability and continuous improvement.” about 43,000 associates, from all ethnic and social backgrounds, are united in providing quality service to 12.2 million customers in more than 30 countries around the globe. to successfully navigate an increasingly diverse and global workplace, aafes embraces differences and the broad range of perspectives achieved through diversity. aafes associates share differences that are physical, such as gender, race, age, and targeted disability. we also share less visible distinctions such as culture, personal values, and religious beliefs. this diversity adds value and strength to our organization. in addition to a diverse workforce, aafes is sensitive to the needs of our customers. there is no cookie cutter approach to providing quality goods and services at competitively low prices when and where they are needed. it takes an organization that cares to get it right. the value added to aafes by veteran-owned, women-owned and minority-owned companies cannot be overemphasized. the best way to meet our customers’ needs is by entering into business with the very people we serve. bottom line; aafes is committed to being a great organization that is full of opportunity in “people, products and partnerships.” keith l. thurgood mg, u.s. army commander francis l. hendricks brigadier general, usaf deputy commanding general michael p. howard chief operating officer > meet aafes’ diversity leadership council <
