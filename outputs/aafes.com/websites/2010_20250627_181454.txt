coupon acceptance aafes accepts online coupons. this change in strategy supports the aafes strategic plan to develop a lifelong emotional connection with our customers. coupons are redeemable as a cash substitute for legal tender when purchasing the items specified on the coupon. aafes facilities will accept all valid coupons when redeemed in accordance with the terms stipulated on the coupon, and ensure that the terms of the agreement printed on each coupon are followed. after redemption, coupons become part of the facilities' overall cash flow and must be safeguarded and properly accounted for. redemption of manufacturer's coupons we will accept one aafes-issued online and one manufacturer's online coupon for the same item, unless either coupon prohibits that practice. the following elements must be present for the coupon to be valid: the words "manufacturer coupon" a message to the retailer specifying the terms and conditions for accepting the coupons a scan-able bar code and an expiration date a manufacturer redemption address to ensure the coupon can be processed for payment usage policies in small print containing standard terminology, such as "limit one coupon per item, per customer" and "no copies permitted" a specially stated face value, e.g., "50 cents" or an "up to" or "no more than" value ("value no more than $5.00") for coupons with an open dollar value, cashiers must fill in the coupon with the aafes sell price to qualify for redemption. coupons do not carry cash value. in situations where the coupon's value is greater than the sell price of the designated item, the item's sell price becomes the face value of the coupon. our cash registers are programmed to only take the value of that item, regardless if the coupon is more than the item itself.
