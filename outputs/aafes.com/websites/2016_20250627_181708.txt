overview area maintains original goals, expands scope since formed in 1975 the retired employees association is a worldwide organization for the exchange retirees. first formed back in 1975, the purpose of the association was to continue the friendships and associations that had been made during exchange careers, a legacy that continues today in the association's endeavors. today, the retired employees association can boast of having over 18 local chapters with 3,700 members and spouses all over the united states. the purpose of area and its chapters is threefold: (1) to foster communication and social activities between retired army & air force exchange service employees; (2) to support the interests of the exchange, its employees and the people it serves; and (3) to promote the interests of association members. while the activities of local chapters, quarterly newsletters and membership directories continue the original intent of maintaining old friendships, area has grown significantly since it was founded. one of our most important activities is helping to protect the retiree benefit. while the exchange does an excellent job of enhancing and protecting the retiree benefit, area's members represent a significant force that can generate letters and phone calls to our representatives in congress to protect our own benefits from unsettling proposals. the area scholarship program is a long-standing area activity. we've provided scholarships to the children of the exchange employees for many years, having contributed a total of $713,295 to further their education. the amount of the fund continues to grow each year, and we awarded 12 scholarships in 2016 for $40,000. you can download a list of scholarship awards since program initiation. one of our newer activities, emergency relief, provides financial assistance to the exchange associates and their families devastated by disasters such as fire, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. it was initiated several years ago when it was concluded that the exchange could not legally provide the service. area stepped in and assumed the responsibility for providing a depository for donations collected from the exchange associates and retirees, as well as from sources outside the exchange. shortly after the program was set up, area was asked to activate the area emergency relief fund in support of the exchange associates at seymour johnson afb after hurricane floyd devastated the east coast in 1999. the exchange associates and area members contributed more than $39,500 for the pentagon victims fund following the attacks of september 11, 2001. in september, 2005, area members and supporters contributed $59,845.87 to the exchange associates at keesler afb who were impacted by hurricane katrina. area's 18 local chapters set their own dues, and meet several times a year for lunch, dinner, trips, picnics, and other social and charitable activities. they seek to maintain current friendships and make new ones while adding new dimensions to their retirement. if you're not an area member now, you can join the national organization online. organizational membership from the president why join area? apply / renew membership membership update form area contacts board membership governing directives bylaws constitution area privacy policy acrobat reader download community programs scholarships emergency relief community service publications miscellaneous retiree self service financial statements benefits area & exchange news chapters history of officers milestones 2015-current milestones 2010-2014 milestones 2000-2009 milestones 1974-1999 government links about the exchange our organization public affairs exchange careers eeo, diversity & inclusion doing business with the exchange family serving family sustainability retired employees association military retiree connection pcs headquarters school lunch program homeschooling foia/privacy post-government employment exchange stores store locator reel time movie guide for overseas customers price match policy refunds and exchanges exchange quick facts provide store feedback emergency preparedness shopmyexchange savings center purchase gift & phone cards gift card balance check internet, tv & phone service operation be fit sweepstakes coupon acceptance policy terms & conditions exchange credit apply now about the military star card manage account & pay bill promotions & offers sister services marine corps exchange coast guard exchange stay connected sign up for emails receive exclusive email-only offers and advance notice about sales and events › subscribe enter to win sweepstakes › enter now © 2016 the exchange. all rights reserved. site terms & conditions back to top
