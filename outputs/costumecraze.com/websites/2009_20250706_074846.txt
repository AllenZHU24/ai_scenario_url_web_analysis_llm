that's right - trick or treating and getting lots of candy! we want you to have a fun and safe halloween, so here are some helpful safety tips for trick or treating. 1. when purchasing a costume, consider costumes that allow freedom of movement and vision as children will be climbing stairs, crossing roads and traversing unfamiliar yards. 2. carry a flashlight and stay on sidewalks, when possible. 3. for dark colored costumes, use glow bands or reflective tape. if your child dresses as a witch, for example, you can cut stars of reflective material and attach to the hat or back of the cloak. 4. always follow traffic rules and walk in small groups. 5. stay with an adult, or take a cell phone with you for emergency calls and location updates. 6. go only to well-lit houses and remain on porches rather than entering homes. 7. keep an eye out for open flames from candles and jack-o-lanterns. 8. before eating your candy, always inspect the wrappers and packaging. these safety tips apply to all you "big kids" out there too! here's to a very safe and fun halloween!hollywood halloweenfarrah fawcett and michael jackson are not dead...at least, not where popular costume choices for adult costumes are concerned. according to the miami herald, costume suppliers predict this year’s hot costumes will be influenced by media, movies current events and pop culture with people taking their inspiration from reality television, tabloid celebs and high-profile celebrity deaths. of course, past deaths of notable celebrities continue to remain popular year after year, too. hey, who isn’t a little obsessed with hollywood icons like marilyn monroe and elvis?
