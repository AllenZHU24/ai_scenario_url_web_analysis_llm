(see "when/how will i be paid" for more information.) how will costume craze determine eligibility? a member of costume craze's low-price guarantee team will be checking for the following: completeness and accuracy of all information item(s) found at a lower price must be identical to the one(s) purchased at costume craze item(s) found at a lower price must come from a legitimate online store (and exclude auction, consignment, liquidation/overstock/closeout stores, etc.) and must be in stock and shippable to your location item(s) found at a lower price must not be a closeout or clearance item, and must not be used, refurbished, or otherwise materially different from costume craze's new (in original packaging) item(s) coupon codes or any other form of discounts (public or private) are ineligible in determining the price difference when/how will i be paid? once your claim has been reviewed (typically within 2 weeks), you will be immediately credited the entire amount due. payments are in the form of an in-store credit to use on a future purchase. for example, if the price difference is $10, we will give you an in-store credit of $11.50! there is no expiration date on this in-store credit, so feel free to apply it, without pressure, whenever you are ready to shop with us next. questions? feel free to contact us with any questions by calling us toll-free at 1-888-922-7293 (801-796-1053, for callers outside the us & canada), or contact us online by using our contact form, or email us directly at support@costumecraze.com. we look forward to serving you! *note: only shipped orders are eligible. if an order is split (i.e., only a portion of an order is shipped), or is otherwise modified after the order is placed, only the portion that was shipped is eligible for consideration. in every case, returned merchandise is ineligible. (if a claim is granted prior to the return, the credit will be forfeited/deducted from the amount due from the return.) © 2001-11 costume craze, llc. all rights reserved. privacy policy | returns policy | terms & conditions/faq home | returns policy | view cart | about us | careers | affiliate program | site map | contact us | gift cards
