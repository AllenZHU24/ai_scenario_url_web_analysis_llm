printing if the design contains white and additional color elements. for example, if your design contains red, blue, orange and white, these colors can all be printed in the same design. this is an upgrade from traditional knock-out printing, which only gives the illusion of white printing. with white ink printing, your mailings and stationery are sure to stand out. for a fresh and unique look, print crisp white ink on dark papers, metallics and more. white ink printing is available on a huge variety of styles and colors. color printing options, explained 1 color printing one color printing means that your design contains only one ink color. for example, if you print design is all black, that means the design is 1 color printing. gray scale designs, which contain a range of grays, are also considered one color printing. learn more in our printing options explained video. 2 color printing two color printing means that your design contains two different ink colors. for example, if your printed design only contains navy blue and gold then that means it's two color printing. learn more in our printing options explained video. full color printing all print designs with more than two colors require an ink process called full color printing, which is also known as cmyk. cmyk stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and key (key means black). these four ink colors can be combined to print an unlimited number of colors. if your design contains more than two colors, it's full color printing. learn more in our printing options explained video. production time standard production - 5
