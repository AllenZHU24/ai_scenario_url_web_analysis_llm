envelopes.com see envelopes.com through the years about us: from our start in 1971 as action envelope, a queens, ny envelope printing company, founder ken newman served a local clientele of about 100. today we are envelopes.com, a leading internet business touching millions. we focus on one thing: to provide the largest in-stock selection of sizes, styles, and colors to ensure customers find the perfect product for their unique needs. we combine this with quick shipments, quality printing, and great customer service to ensure total customer satisfaction. throughout the years, many changes have taken place leading to the company's huge expansion, and exciting success, but it wasn't always good times. ken's wife, sharon newman took over the company in 1993 upon his sudden death. through tough times, sharon worked long days and nights wearing many hats to keep the company afloat. with 3 young children, her goal was to support her family and give her son seth the opportunity to join the family business as he always wanted. she succeeded and seth newman joined the company in 1998 and shifted the focus of the company to the internet, launching the company's first website soon after. these changes (and many others), combined with the expanding team of dedicated and well trained employees, have given envelopes.com the power to become the no. 1 envelope company on the internet, recognized as a top 1000 internet retailer, and inc. 5000 fastest growing company for multiple years. today, as a second generation, 43-year young, family-owned and operated business, envelopes.com continues to grow through innovation in our products, services, and customer experience. our core values: with growth and transformations, it is always key to remember what's important. it is thanks to our core values, that we've been able to advance and succeed! go behind the scenes at envelopes.com envelopes.com: through the years now we are so excited to share a fresh, new look

through our site, find your desired products and place plain or custom printed orders with ease! in addition to our streamlined desktop shopping process, we are over the moon to offer a mobile friendly experience for browsing and placing plain orders! 2014-2015 envelopes.com has become the leading online supplier of envelopes, paper and coverstock products. customers can now easily purchase hard to find products such as digital sheet sizes, or made to order items. along with unique product offerings and cutting edge services such as white ink and variable data printing, we were ecstatic to launch a brand new, user-friendly online design tool with hundreds of templates. the online designer allows customers to customize just about anything from invitations to personalized notecards. 2011 - 2013 action envelope became envelopes.com to better reflect our focus and leadership of selling envelopes online. a newly designed page and color scheme accompanied the name change along with product and service expansion. 2008 - 2010 our latest website release is really pushing the envelope. sorry, we couldn't resist. it is packed with new features, and even more new products. new functions like shop by color, and shop by collection really give you a full view of our entire product line. we are also excited to offer our new custom envelope creator. creating that perfect envelope has never been easier. enjoy the new site, and of course let us know what we can do to make it better! 2004 - 2007 shopping on-line became the way of business. we stocked even more sizes and window configurations. new trends in shapes, such as square envelopes, and exotic finishes, such as metallics, became important to consumers. our customers' creativity blossomed as we offered a huge selection of papers and full color printing on envelopes. 2003 - 2004 action envelope continued to grow as customers had easy access to products that were previously hard to find. you asked and we listened, adding more sizes of envelopes and a wide range of colors to bring attention to your mailings. the explosion of small businesses inspired our lower printed minimums, design-on-line features and full line of shipping and packaging envelopes. 2000 - 2002 action envelope was incorporated in 1971 and operated as a local envelope printing company in the new york metropolitan area. we specialized in basic business envelopes printed in 1 or 2 colors for mailings and general office use. the advent of e-commerce opened exciting new doors, and we were able to offer our products and services nationwide. top styles business envelopes window envelopes remittance envelopes letterhead invitation envelopes wedding invitations save the dates square envelopes mini envelopes lined
