1. yellow gold – hello yellow! this warm metal type will be very popular in 2015. from fashion jewelry to engagement rings, yellow gold is back in a big way.  a beacoup amount has been seen on the runway and red carpets and we can’t wait to see more! 2. statement necklaces – although simple necklaces can be chic, filling a neckline with beading or sparkle is always trending. these bold statement necklaces will make your entire outfit look like a strong statement, in very good way! 3. stacking rings – whether its different metal types, designs, stone colors or all of the above, stacking rings is always a chic look that can transition from day to night. and no matter which rings you choose to stack, it almost always looks great… almost always.4. pink, purples, red colored stones – with marsala being the color of 2015 that is sometimes not so inspiring, you can expect to see similar shades of the color in rings, necklaces, earrings, etc. stones colors like rose, ruby or amethyst are great options to choose!5. vintage designs – the art deco influence is still going strong! a look that i personally love, vintage inspired jewelry looks great with a casual, work or evening outfit. divine darling! tags: 2015 jewelry trends diamond nexus 0 comments | posted in fashion and celebrities by jaclyn leibham once more into the breach 12/29/14 12:49 pm it’s that time of year again: we think about all the things we didn’t accomplish in 2014 and we promise ourselves that 2015 will be different. we create lists, change our routine, and tell ourselves that this is going to be the year we change. we take our goals head on in january but then come february, march... april... they begin to fade. year after year we make ourselves these promises and they never seem to pan out the way we hoped. so why do we keep doing this to ourselves? what is it about this time of year that makes us want to start fresh? and then why after such high hopes, do our plans slowly fade away? einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. as i look at my goals from 2013 and 2014 i see a trend: i’m going to get in better shape, take my career to new levels, spend more time with my family and learn new skills. it’s now the end of 2014 and i’m still too overweight, still not where i want to be in my career, still haven’t spent as much time with my family and still have not learned to play the guitar. so maybe it’s insane to set goals for 2015. maybe i should just throw in the towel and realize that no matter how strong the resolve in january, it won’t hold come summer. but luckily i won’t. luckily, i’m a little bit insane. you see, i didn’t hit a lot of my goals in 2014 but i did move closer to them. i spent a few less weekends ordering pizza and a few more doing crossfit competitions. i read a few more books about business and applied them to my job. i spent a few extra weekends with my family that i hadn’t in the past. i well… at least i own a guitar now! no, i didn’t achieve a lot of my goals this year but i got closer to them. i improved who i am. and although my motivation for achievement slowly faded over the year, it was better than never being motivated at all. and now here comes another year and another set of crazy goals. i’ll probably be writing this time next year how i didn’t hit them yet again. but i’ll be dammed if i’ll ever stop trying. einstein may find me insane, but the relentless desire to keep trying is what i believe makes humans great. so i challenge you, with the few days you have left in 2014: set wild, crazy, audacious goals for 2015. and for however long your motivation holds; work like crazy to achieve them. you may fail, you may give up after a few weeks, but you will have tried. you see, failure is certain in life but having the guts to get back up and try again is not. those insane enough to keep on swinging, are the ones crazy enough to succeed. i'll sign out with a quote of peace for the new year: “if we fail in love, we fail in all things else.” – william sloane coffin - kyle blades, director of marketing tags: new-year's-resolution 2015 diamond-nexus 0 comments | posted by jaclyn leibham tell us your favorite gift and win! 12/22/14 3:29 pm a rafflecopter giveaway 38 comments | posted in customer stories by kyle blades items 1-5 of 95 sort by created at added by show 5 per page page: 1 2 3 4 5 join the club! subscribe for exclusive offers about us product info customer service compare our stones how our stones are made retail locations our blog free catalog latest trends ring buying guide company info order now! connect with us follow us for news, trends, and fun! facebook twitter pinterest instagram google plus youtube diamond nexus blog © 2004-2015 diamond nexus div. lautrec corp. all rights reserved.  |  privacy policy | customer service (800) 509-4990 | live chat magento blog extension by aheadworks
