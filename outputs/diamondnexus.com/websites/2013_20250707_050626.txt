our core principles will always be: to bring beautiful, extraordinarily high quality jewelry of the finest design to our customers at an often shockingly affordable price. to provide the finest customer service in the jewelry industry. to back all of our products with the strongest warranties and lifetime guarantees possible. > click here to learn more about diamond nexus on our wikipedia page > click here to stay up to date with diamond nexus on our linkedin page > click here to learn about our diamond nexus store in woodfield mall we provide luxury products that satisfy the soul's desire to feel respected and the mind's desire to feel smart. about us corporate background environment commitment retail locations connection tomiss universe® affiliate program about our stones careers customer service money back guarantee customer returns return policy shipping information faq my order history contact us 1-800-509-4990 5050 w. ashland way franklin, wi 53132 email us live chat shop engagement rings fine jewelry fashion jewelry custom jewelry gifts sale items free catalogby mail! follow us on social facebook twitter pinterest google plus youtube diamond nexus blog sign up for special offers! © 2004-2013 diamond nexus div. lautrec corp. all rights reserved.  |  privacy policy
