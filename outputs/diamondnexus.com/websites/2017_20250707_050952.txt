the diamond nexus solitaire our ring is solid metal; it will be made to your order and cast specifically for your finger. our ring is heavy and full weight, and can contain up to 20% more gold than the jewelry chain stores. you will feel the difference on your finger. the diamond nexus ring has a graceful taper. it’s hand-finished and polished. the edges are rolled. this makes the fit more comfortable. the prongs are important to the ring’s structure. the prongs are part of the ring’s design; this makes the ring stronger, and keeps the stone from falling out. in fact, we’re so sure your stone will never fall out that if it does, we’ll replace it free. here’s what you can’t see: the price of the diamond nexus ring is significantly less than the mall ring. your savings are because you’re buying direct from the manufacturer online. and you’re supporting jobs in the united states. the mall solitaire mass produced rings are just that – mass produced. they’re stamped and created by the thousands. it’s likely that the actual gold content in the ring is less. machine-made rings may actually be hollow to save on materials. stamped rings have squarer, not rolled, edges. they are rarely hand polished. the prongs are usually soldered on; these are referred to as “peg-heads.”it’s cheaper to add them to a stamped ring than to forge a ring with prongs as part of the ring’s structure. here’s what you can’t see: the rent for the mall space, the national advertising and the significant markup. and mass produced rings are most likely made off-shore. handcrafted with care any jewelry from diamond nexus, whether it’s a fashion ring, earrings, bracelet or necklace, is made to the highest jewelry standards. it’s our promise to you, forever... exclusive offers & discounts thank you! you'll now receive exclusive information and special offers on fine jewelry in your inbox. you can also create an account to update your preferences, create a wish list and write reviews! contact us chat call email as featured in contact us diamond nexus5050 w ashland wayfranklin, wi 53132 usa 1-800-509-4990 email us live chat learn about us contemporary nexus diamonds™ the forever guarantee our quality promise faqs blog our companies forever companies 1215 diamonds forever artisans diamond nexus social free catalog a forever company. all rights reserved | privacy policy diamond_icon enter email address gender gender (optional) male female enter to win official contest rules | privacy policy catalog_edit first name last name address apt / suite / other city state state alabama alaska arizona arkansas armed forces americas armed forces europe armed forces pacific california colorado connecticut delaware district of columbia florida georgia hawaii idaho illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky louisiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi missouri montana nebraska nevada new hampshire new jersey new mexico new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania rhode island south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming zip get free catalog no thanks thank_you you're now entered to win a $2,500 diamond nexus shopping spree. don’t let that stop you from shopping though, if you make a purchase and win, we’ll simply credit your account. make sure you watch your email for more information from us and enjoy shopping our site shop now
