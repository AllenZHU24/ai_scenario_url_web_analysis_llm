you, and the earth! who benefits?you, and the earth. in 2005, we developed a groundbreaking type of stone that was in so many ways different than any simulant stone ever created. the contemporary nexus diamond™ is in a class by itself. it is significantly less expensive to manufacture than to dig up a mined diamond in africa. it is even more beautiful than a mined diamond, because it’s perfect and can be cut to an ideal standard only reserved for the top five percent of mined diamonds. proudly made in the u.s.a. we opened the first large scale jewelry manufacturing business in the united states in 20 years. we hired old-school master goldsmiths and jewelry-making artisans who believed in quality and were motivated by perfection in every detail. we allowed them to take the time to craft, one piece at a time, the highest quality settings with the finest metals. proudly made in the u.s.a. we opened the first large scale jewelry manufacturing business in the united states in 20 years. we hired old-school master goldsmiths and jewelry-making artisans who believed in quality and were motivated by perfection in every detail. we allowed them to take the time to craft, one piece at a time, the highest quality settings with the finest metals. your world, even more beautiful what that means for your world is that your dream ring both costs significantly less and has significantly better quality than a ring purchased at a chain retailer. and if you had more in your budget for a ring, you can now take a honeymoon with the money you saved. that changes everything, doesn’t it?
