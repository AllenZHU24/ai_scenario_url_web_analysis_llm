only gift cards and the dreambook itself are non-returnable. items purchased through our e-steals and other "closeout" sales are not returnable. really?  what about custom orders or engraved jewelry? even full custom orders are returnable, but do come with a 20% design fee and the original cad fee (if applicable) is not refundable. alternatively, you could elect to take 100% store credit. most engraved jewelry may be returned, but engraving fees are non-refundable and returned engraved jewelry is subject to a $15 re-polishing fee. some restrictions may apply. how does diamond nexus determine its pricing? there are four factors to consider when pricing jewelry: stones, precious metals, design art/engineering, and artisanship.  essentially, this boils down to materials and labor.  a ring with elaborate filigree workmanship but a relatively small stone may cost more than a simple ring with a much larger stone, because it took much more work to create it.  two rings with the same fundamental design and the same size stones can be priced differently because one may contain more precious metal than the other, or may be more difficult to cast. why are diamond nexus stones so much less expensive than other lab-created precious jewels? we offer our products at the most reasonable prices we can.  unfortunately, we can’t explain other companies’ pricing because we don’t have any information about their internal costs or structure. what are diamond nexus lab-created stones made out of, and how are they different from natural diamonds? mined diamonds are a crystalline substance made out of carbon. diamond nexus gemstones are a crystalline substance that is very complexly engineered and chemically different from a mined diamond; they contain carbon, but very little of it. optically (how they look) and physically (how hard they are, how they wear and last, etc) they are nearly identical to mined diamond and no one in the world can tell them apart visually by eye alone, but the chemistry is completely different. the question we ask our customers to consider is if you want to pay thousands of dollars for chemistry. why can’t you make your stones with just carbon? actually we can, however, currently the cost of making white (clear) diamonds in the lab in sizes larger than a half carat exceeds the cost of mining them by a pretty substantial margin. trust us; we are working on the problem. we do currently sell pure carbon man-made diamonds, but only in a canary yellow color. they are priced at less then half the cost of a canary colored mined diamond. i heard that diamond nexus stones are just regular cz.  are they? no, actually they’re not. sorry to get a little technical here, but there’s no way around it: common cz generally contains two elements. zirconium and yttrium. while a diamond nexus also contains zirconium, it also contains hafnium, gadolinium, cobalt and other elements. the elements in a diamond nexus are tremendously more expensive then the elements is a cz. this results in a stone that is harder, tougher and significantly heavier then a cz. in fact, the easiest way to differentiate a diamond nexus gemstone from a cz is simply by weighing it. the diamond nexus stone is approximately 20% heavier for an equal size stone. (dn mark iv and mark v) this material is then coated in a patent applied for material which contains al203 corundum and other elements to a thickness of approximately one micron (dn mark v stones. dn mark iv, 120 +/- nanometers). this coating is bonded to the substrate on the molecular level and will never wear off in normal use. the coating significantly lowers the porosity of the stone and renders it nearly impervious to any degradation. the coating also brings the optical properties of the stone almost perfectly in line with mined diamond. so, while the manufacturing process of a diamond nexus shares some of the same manufacturing process of cz, there are many more steps, elements and treatments involved in a diamond nexus simulant.  the result is a different stone with different, better properties. so diamond nexus gemstones are not cz.  what makes them better? cz’s have three problems. first, their optical properties are not spot-on to a diamond. they have a bit higher refractive index, and that’s why they can appear “glassy”. the second problem is that they are considerably softer than a diamond and so they tend to wear, especially where the planes of the facets meet. as the facets wear the stone can lose its sparkle. and third, cz’s are quite porous, and they tend to absorb elements in their environment such as smoke, hand lotion, or even just natural oils from your fingers. this will, over time, make the stone appear cloudy or discolored. a diamond nexus gemstone solves these problems. first, the core material is heavier, harder and tougher (technically, has a higher tensile strength) then cz. it will easily last for generations of normal wear. next, the patent applied for al203 coating renders the stone highly non-porous, non-reactive, and impervious to things in its environment; it will never degrade as a cz will. the coating also brings the refractive index almost perfectly in line with a mined diamond and gives a diamond nexus the near exact look of a perfect, flawless diamond. > click here to see why miss universe wears diamond nexus why does my diamond nexus look brighter than my friend's diamond? the average diamond sold in america today is a “j” color, si-2 clarity stone. the diamond industry calls this “near colorless” but the reality is that it’s quite off color when compared to a high-quality “d” color diamond. all diamond nexus stones are perfect “d” color and “if” clarity (internally flawless) many people have never seen a diamond of this quality, and so a diamond nexus which has these qualities can look different then the average diamond. a diamond nexus looks exactly like a very expensive high-quality diamond, which means it may look a little different - cleaner, whiter and brighter - from the average poor-quality diamond sold today. why do you talk so much about ethics and environmental consciousness? the diamond industry is extremely notorious for its practices, not only in business but also in production.  aside from worldwide market manipulation, the diamond cartel has been tangled up in issues of slavery, mutilation, terrorism, and genocide for decades.  even legitimate diamond mining operations are responsible for massive deforestation, pollution, destruction of wildlife, and hazardous working conditions leading to the suffering and death of hundreds to thousands of workers.  we believe that diamond simulants are more than an affordable alternative to the hype that the cartel has worked up for its own benefit; we believe they may be a key factor in ending the cycle of violence, devastation, and murder.to learn more about the effects of the diamond cartel and conflict diamonds, we recommend glitter & greed: the secret world of the diamond cartel by janine roberts. where can i learn more about diamond nexus? > click here to visit the diamond nexus wikipedia page > click here to visit the diamond nexus facebook page > click here to follow diamond nexus on twitter > click here to follow the diamond nexus linkedin page > click here to follow the diamond nexus blog > click here to watch the diamond nexus youtube channel about us corporate background environment commitment retail locations connection tomiss universe® affiliate program about our stones careers customer service money back guarantee customer returns return policy shipping information faq my order history contact us 1-800-509-4990 5050 w. ashland way franklin, wi 53132 email us live chat shop engagement rings fine jewelry fashion jewelry custom jewelry gifts sale items free catalogby mail! follow us on social facebook twitter pinterest google plus youtube diamond nexus blog sign up for special offers! © 2004-2013 diamond nexus div. lautrec corp. all rights reserved.  |  privacy policy
