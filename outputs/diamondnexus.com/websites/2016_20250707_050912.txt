the diamond nexus solitaire our ring is solid metal; it will be made to your order and cast specifically for your finger. our ring is heavy and full weight, and can contain up to 20% more gold than the jewelry chain stores. you will feel the difference on your finger. the diamond nexus ring has a graceful taper. it’s hand-finished and polished. the edges are rolled. this makes the fit more comfortable. the prongs are important to the ring’s structure. the prongs are part of the ring’s design; this makes the ring stronger, and keeps the stone from falling out. in fact, we’re so sure your stone will never fall out that if it does, we’ll replace it free. here’s what you can’t see: the price of the diamond nexus ring is significantly less than the mall ring. your savings are because you’re buying direct from the manufacturer online. and you’re supporting jobs in the united states. the mall solitaire mass produced rings are just that – mass produced. they’re stamped and created by the thousands. it’s likely that the actual gold content in the ring is less. machine-made rings may actually be hollow to save on materials. stamped rings have squarer, not rolled, edges. they are rarely hand polished. the prongs are usually soldered on; these are referred to as “peg-heads.”it’s cheaper to add them to a stamped ring than to forge a ring with prongs as part of the ring’s structure. here’s what you can’t see: the rent for the mall space, the national advertising and the significant markup. and mass produced rings are most likely made off-shore. handcrafted with care any jewelry from diamond nexus, whether it’s a fashion ring, earrings, bracelet or necklace, is made to the highest jewelry standards. it’s our promise to you, forever... contact us (800) 509-4990 5050 w ashland wayfranklin, wi 53132 email us learn about us contemporary nexus diamonds™ the forever guarantee our quality promise blog assistance my account my wishlist customer service returns shipping social: free catalog a forever company. 2016 all rights reserved | privacy policy free catalog order now follow us for news, trends and fun! a forever company. 2016 all rights reserved | privacy policy enter contest no thanks thank you! you have been entered for a chance to win the ring of your dreams! close
