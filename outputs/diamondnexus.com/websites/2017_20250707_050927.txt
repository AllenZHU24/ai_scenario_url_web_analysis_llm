are mined from the earth. there is absolutely no reason to buy diamonds that are mined from the earth. today’s stones, which are grown in a lab, like flowers in a greenhouse, are in all ways superior to stones found in the ground. patented* contemporary nexus diamonds™ are technically simulants, but are more comparable to mined stones than to any other simulant. the nexus diamond™ the world's first heirloom-quality diamond alternative. indistinguishable to a jeweler with a loupe a jeweler cannot see the difference between a mined diamond and a nexus diamond™. the only clue: the nexus diamond is flawless. cut, color and clarity – perfect, perfect and perfect lab-controlled conditions make perfect stones. absolutely colorless (d color), internally flawless (if rated) and ideal cut to “hearts and arrows” for maximum fire. aig certified (american international gemologists) nexus diamonds™ are graded and certified the same as mined diamonds. you will receive all certifications with your purchase and can validate the certification on the aig website. visually identical, breathtakingly beautiful essentially identical to mined diamonds but chemically different, nexus diamond alternatives are significantly less expensive, so most people opt for a bigger stone than what they may normally choose. the impact is striking. the nexus diamond™ the world's first heirloom-quality

in a controlled environment, they are perfect and do not have the variations in color common to mined gemstones. true grown diamonds™ 100 percent visually, physically, chemically diamonds true grown diamonds are, in every way, diamonds. diamonds have been man made for decades, but it’s only been recently that technology has advanced to grow them to a size appropriate for fine jewelry. because they are identical to mined diamonds, they also have flaws and are graded and certified by the same standards of mined diamonds. pure grown diamonds cost 30 to 50 percent less than their mined counterpart. all of the rings you see on our website are shown with nexus diamond alternatives; upon request, we can substitute true grown diamonds in any setting and reestimate costs. or, our sister company, 1215 diamonds, features exclusively true grown diamonds in their ring collections. the eco/ethical reason why not to use mined stones most people are aware of the terms “blood diamond” and “conflict diamond.” here’s what that means: diamonds are mined in horrific conditions, principally in africa, by people who make next to nothing for their labor. the organizations that manage this labor and hold territorial rights to the land do so by force. to say “unfair labor practices and human-rights violations” really means slave labor. decades ago the people who ran these operations were called cartels; today, we call them terrorists, or at best, smugglers. the manner in which they mine the earth to harvest their bounty is environmentally disastrous. the kimberly process is flawed big jewelry companies will talk about the kimberly process, which was enacted in 2002 to try to monitor diamonds supplied from unethical mining operations. but loopholes are prevalent, forged certificates are common, and there is no way anyone can tell a true ethically sourced diamond from one mined under terror and destruction. for all these reasons, we do not use mined stones. exclusive offers &
