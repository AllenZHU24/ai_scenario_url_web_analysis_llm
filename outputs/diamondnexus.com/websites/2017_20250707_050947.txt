your world. we have the words world changing in our logo. why? because when you discover diamond nexus, you come to realize that fine jewelry and dream engagement rings cost a lot less than you might have thought. and that changes everything in your world. who benefits with diamond nexus? you, and the earth! who benefits?you, and the earth. in 2005, we developed a groundbreaking type of stone that was in so many ways different than any simulant stone ever created. the contemporary nexus diamond™ is in a class by itself. it is significantly less expensive to manufacture than to dig up a mined diamond in africa. it is even more beautiful than a mined diamond, because it’s perfect and can be cut to an ideal standard only reserved for the top five percent of mined diamonds. proudly made in the u.s.a. we opened the first large scale jewelry manufacturing business in the united states in 20 years. we hired old-school master goldsmiths and jewelry-making artisans who believed in quality and were motivated by perfection in every detail. we allowed them to take the time to craft, one piece at a time, the highest quality settings with the finest metals. proudly made in the u.s.a. we opened the first large scale jewelry manufacturing business in the united states in 20 years. we hired old-school master goldsmiths and jewelry-making artisans who believed in quality and were motivated by perfection in every detail. we allowed them to take the time to craft, one piece at a time, the highest quality settings with the finest metals. your world, even more beautiful what that means for your world is that your dream ring both costs significantly less and has significantly better quality than a ring purchased at a chain retailer. and if you had more in your budget for a ring, you can now take a honeymoon with the money you saved. that changes everything, doesn’t it? our companies are different. and we’re proud of that. forever companies owns and operates diamond nexus, forever artisans and 12fifteen diamonds. mark twain once remarked “they didn’t know it was impossible… so they did it.” we take this to heart every day. we perfected a stone that is better than a mined diamond. it costs less, so we charge less. we made fine jewelry attainable, and challenged marketing hypnotism that an engaged couple has to spend three months salary on a ring. that’s ridiculous. we created a special place in our wisconsin workshops, where all the people we need to serve our customers are gathered under one roof: designers, artisans, goldsmiths, customer care specialists, the folks who pack the boxes and load the trucks. we can talk to each other and solve problems. we work hard. we are committed to each other, and together we care for our customers like they are part of our family. break it, we’ll fix or replace it. we have the broadest guarantees in the jewelry industry, or frankly, any industry. if your stone gets cracked or chipped, it’s covered under our lifetime stone guarantee—forever. don’t like it? we’ll refund your money when you return it within 30 days. need re-polishing or prong tightening? we’ll do it for free, as long as your everything’s covered plan is in place. *conditions apply, read conditions here. want to call a number and speak to a human? done. want the human to walk down the hall and check on your ring’s progress? ditto. while the rest of the jewelry industry might tell you that it’s complicated (so it costs more, supporting fine jewelry’s elitism), we’re here to tell you it’s simple. and while they may go off-shore to avoid paying american workers a living wage, we employ over 100 people in wisconsin with a work environment that keeps our employees here for a long time. and they all wear dazzling fine jewelry. we’re forever companies, and we’re proud, nearly defiant, about about our differences. you don’t have to agree with the way we operate, but it does make for an impossibly fantastic jewelry buying experience. to find out more about forever artisans, our custom jewelry group, and 12fifteen diamonds, our bridal site featuring true grown diamonds™, simply click on the links. exclusive offers & discounts thank you! you'll now receive exclusive information and special offers on fine jewelry in your inbox. you can also create an account to update your preferences, create a wish list and write reviews! contact us chat call email as featured in contact us diamond nexus5050 w ashland wayfranklin, wi 53132 usa 1-800-509-4990 email us live chat learn about us contemporary nexus diamonds™ the forever guarantee our quality promise faqs blog our companies forever companies 1215 diamonds forever artisans diamond nexus social free catalog a forever company. all rights reserved | privacy policy diamond_icon enter email address gender gender (optional) male female enter to win official contest rules | privacy policy catalog_edit first name last name address apt / suite / other city state state alabama alaska arizona arkansas armed forces americas armed forces europe armed forces pacific california colorado connecticut delaware district of columbia florida georgia hawaii idaho illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky louisiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi missouri montana nebraska nevada new hampshire new jersey new mexico new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania rhode island south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming zip get free catalog no thanks thank_you you're now entered to win a $2,500 diamond nexus shopping spree. don’t let that stop you from shopping though, if you make a purchase and win, we’ll simply credit your account. make sure you watch your email for more information from us and enjoy shopping our site shop now
