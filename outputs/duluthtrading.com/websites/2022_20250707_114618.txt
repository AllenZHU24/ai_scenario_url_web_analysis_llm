information. the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information. the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you. 2. deletion request rights you have the right to request that we delete some or all of the personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to a number of exceptions. we (and our service providers) are not required to delete personal information where it is, for example: (a) necessary to complete a transaction with you or for warranty or product recalls; (b) used for security purposes, to prevent fraud, to fix errors, or to comply with law; (c) reasonable for us to use for internal purposes given our relationship with you; or (d) compatible with the context in which you provided the information. the list of exceptions above is not exhaustive and we may also deny a deletion request as otherwise permitted by law. 3. exercising your rights to exercise your rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: calling us at 1-866-401-9314, or filling out our webform only you, or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. if you are making a request on behalf of another person, we may require that you prove you are authorized to act on behalf of that individual. you may make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability only twice within a 12-month period. the verifiable consumer request must: provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. we may not be able to fulfill your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot

entity to another entity without hindrance. we do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. if we
