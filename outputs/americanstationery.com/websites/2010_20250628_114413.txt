(i once received a velvet elvis picture that became part of the gift exchange in years to come.) you can even hold a contest for the "weirdest’, "ugliest", and "most creative use of glitter/rubber bands/dry pasta".you can always do the secret santa thing where a group of people each draw names of others in the group and must purchase something for that person in secret (set a spending limit either way).with a little planning your gift exchange party will be a memorable event for you and your guests. tis the time to be jolly!
