(thermography is a printing technology that allows the ink to rest on the surface of the paper.) thermography is applied at relatively low heat and has little heat tolerance. this means that the high heat used in a laser printer will cause the ink to come off the paper and adhere to the laser printer's drum. this can ruin a good batch of paper, or worse, ruin the laser printer itself. on the website, embossed items appear with gray ink. why?
