there’s a new way: online only, without retails markups. join now to shop team press jobs contact — there’s a — new way we create the shortest path from our designs to your hands. edited design all of our pieces are created in-house by a small team of designers who obsess over every detail. we do not outsource and we do not overproduce. instead of offering 20 options for a shirt, we try to make only the best in each category. we source the most beautiful fabrics from around the world, and fit every style ten times over. it’s a tedious process, but one that allows us to focus our attention on quality and the finer design details. same factories a great design is nothing without a great factory that can bring the design to life. we spend months seeking out the best ones, the very same factories producing your favorite designer labels. each factory specializes in different fabrics and construction. for instance, the best silk is produced in kowloon, china—a country with a rich history in silk—while the finest jerseys are sewn at select facilities in los angeles, a city known for its t-shirt culture. all of our international factories meet workplace compliancy standards. no middlemen a traditional designer shirt is sold at over 50 different stores and is marked up 8x by the time it reaches you. at everlane, we bypass these channels and create the shortest path from our designs to your hands. we have no physical stores and no retail partners. instead, we sell exclusively at everlane.com. by avoiding all of the costs of traditional retail we’re able to offer the same quality as any designer good at truly disruptive prices. — team — they say you should start a business that you wish already existed, so we quit our day jobs. in the fall of 2010, a then 25-year-old michael preysman left his job in venture capital to start his own business. he never expected to work in fashion, but a passion for great design and frustration with the lack of innovation in the retail space, led him to build everlane. he hasn’t looked back. while the team skews young, our employees have cut their teeth at places like google, yelp, gilt groupe, american apparel, marc jacobs, j.crew, goldman sachs, pentagram, and the gap. it’s a motley group held together by a shared passion for pushing boundaries and challenging conventions. we currently work from two offices: engineering, merchandising, and marketing are based in san francisco, while creative and production operate out of los angeles. it’s challenging at times, but we visit each other often. with our biggest cutsomer base in new york, and a growing team on the ground, we plan to eventually have a space there as well. — press — new york times “if you are buying such basics as t- shirts, belts or tote bags at traditional retailers, you’re probably paying too much.” gq “the company designs and produces all of it’s own goods so you, the customer, get to save a good chunk of dough on buying some cool stuff.” lucky magazine “it might seem unlikely that such inexpensive products could be of high quality, but the company has a unique business model on its side: by choosing to sell solely online, it has managed to cut costs to a bare minimum.” style.com “we just never understood why the most beautiful and simple products needed to cost so much. we’ve just cut out the middlemen so we can take smaller margins without sacrificing on quality at all.” los angeles times “when it comes to fashion today it’s easy to be overwhelmed by choice and confused about what things really cost. enter the web-only everlane, founded on a less-is-more philosophy.” glamour “new online shopping site everlane.com is serving up a selection of cute and classic wardrobe staples for less.” — jobs — dear rule
