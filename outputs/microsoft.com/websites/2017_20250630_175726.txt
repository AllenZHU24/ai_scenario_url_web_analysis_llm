microsoft seems well aware of this, and rather then letting the device die they throttle it under sustained load. to microsoft, either don't market the device as a workstation or get it in line with what you say it does. more developer comment · microsoft team responded on 11/28/2017 37 out of 39 people found this helpful. was this helpful?
