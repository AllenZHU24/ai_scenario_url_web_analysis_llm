connect with friends and family, or just want to kick back, play a game or listen to your favorite music, we've got you covered. at the microsoft store, deals change constantly. so even though you'll always find great prices on the latest technology, the actual items available change on a regular basis. however, because the categories of products remain consistent, anytime you stop by you'll likely find great deals on things like: computers: often available at $100 off or more with promotional codes, you'll find laptops and desktops that are fast, powerful and feature crystal-clear images. laptops boast long-lasting batteries, and many of our computers give you the option to use both a traditional keyboard and a touchscreen. mobile devices: for those who want to connect with their friends, family and co-workers at home and on the go, you'll find incredible microsoft deals on some of the hottest tablets and phones available. featuring long-lasting batteries, high-resolution cameras, sleek touchscreens and intuitive interfaces, they give you anywhere access to your favorite apps, email, websites and text messaging. oh – and depending on the device you choose, you can even go the old-fashioned route and call the person you need to connect with. software: in order to get the job done right, you occasionally need to invest in new software. fortunately, by shopping the latest microsoft sales, you can keep your costs down and still get the features and functions you need. however, today's collection may not be the same as tomorrow's, so as your needs change check here first for software at a savings. accessories: from the latest headphones to stylish cases, scanners to printers and keyboards, our accessories will give you the power to do more with your favorite devices. but just like everything else in the sale section of the microsoft store, deals on accessories change quickly, so check back often and get the things you want for less. what's new new surface pro 6 new surface laptop 2 new surface go xbox one x xbox one s vr & mixed reality windows 10 apps office apps store & support account profile download center sales &
