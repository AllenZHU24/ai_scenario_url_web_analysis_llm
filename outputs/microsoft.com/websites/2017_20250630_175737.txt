titles10), xbox game pass8 subscriptions, and accessories will work with an xbox one x. in fact, with the increased power of xbox one x, many games will achieve more consistent framerates, faster load times, improved anisotropic filtering, and will run at their peak resolution if the title features dynamic scaling.do i need a 4k tv to benefit from the xbox one x?no. the power provided by the xbox one x allows developers to use techniques like supersampling, anisotropic filtering, and others to produce a better 1080p image. additionally, games will have the ability to run at higher framerates and with faster load times.1what is supersampling?supersampling is a technique game developers can use to improve graphical fidelity. by utilizing the additional power of the xbox one x, developers can process images at a higher resolution, and then scale them down to fit the display resolution the player is using. supersampled images reduce aliasing (commonly referred to as "jaggies") and generally look "cleaner" to the naked eye compared to a non-supersampled image at the same resolution.will my current controllers and accessories work with xbox one x?all xbox one accessories (controllers, headsets, chatpads, remotes, etc.) will work with xbox one x. kinect for xbox one is also compatible with xbox one x via the xbox kinect adapter (sold separately).will there be two different versions of games—one for the xbox one s and one for the xbox one x?no. there will be one version of all games and they will work on all xbox one consoles.what does xbox one x enhanced mean when i see it on a game?if a game has the xbox one x enhanced icon, this means developers have worked to improve an existing title, or have implemented the most recent developer tools to take full advantage of the power of xbox one x.in addition to calling out which games are xbox one x enhanced, we'll also be indicating which games will play at 4k ultra hd and with support for high dynamic range (hdr).4 4k ultra hd: 4k ultra hd games must achieve a 2160p frame buffer output via native 4k or using advanced rendering techniques such as checkerboarding or dynamic resolution scaling. hdr: hdr games support the hdr10 standard xbox one x enhanced: a developer had done special work to take advantage of 6 teraflops of power in xbox one x. enhanced features will vary by game.how will i transfer all my games and settings to an xbox one x?any xbox one stores your game saves and account information in the cloud, so when you buy a new xbox one console, all you have to do is log in with your existing account and re-download any games or apps you’d like. all your progress, achievements, friends, and profiles will move seamlessly to your new xbox one x (or s). if you use an external hard drive, the process is even easier and will save you the download time—simply move your games and apps from the internal hard drive of your old xbox one to the external drive, then plug it in to your new xbox one x.is xbox one x really the most powerful console ever?yes. no other video game console has ever had 6 teraflops of graphic processing power.what is a teraflop and why should i care how many xbox one x has?flops is an acronym for floating-point operations per second. tera means 1 trillion. so, xbox one x can perform 6 trillion floating-point operations per second. that's rendering graphics, making game physics behave, and things like that. the short version is: games play better on xbox one x because it "thinks" really, really fast. ratings and reviews 4.3 48 5 72% 4

rating:3/5 12/18/2017 phil pc awesome console but..... i put 3 stars because first, the console is fantastic! so much speed, the 4k hdr is amazing! no issues with the console whatsoever but since preordering as soon as they were made available, and getting it the very first day it came out.... us early adopters are getting shafted, we were also "supposed" to get a 4k copy of batman lego movie and i never received mine. microsoft is a great company, don't get me wrong, but for them to offer a free game to "not so early adopters" just to get them to buy the console is not cool. the real fans are the ones preordering and getting the console first day it comes out more was this helpful? yes no report contains spam or advertising contains profanity contains offensive content rating:5/5

offensive content rating:1/5 12/14/2017 valentin pc very dissapointed games will look great as long as the console works. after installing a couple of games the console would not start anymore. i tried several factory resets but the problem will reappear after a while. i understand that 1 star may be to hard as the item could be replaced by a new one. however, this is sold as a premium device and that should be taken into account. specially for customers like me who gave our support by buying the launch scorpio edition. adding to this and in terms of gameplay (when working). i tried froza 7 and rise of the tomb raider. the first one was an amazing experience. however, i have to say that the last one showed significant performance issues with big frame drops that would get you a bit dizzy after a couple of minutes. more was this helpful? yes no report contains spam or advertising contains profanity contains offensive content rating:5/5 12/13/2017 ryan pc great gaming machine

a huge difference! i don't get what the other guy says because it is smoking my other xbox one with fps. xbox one enhanced is no joke! you can not get a pc for this price! maybe about 1200 for the pc with a graphic card that does this maybe! or build your own frankenstein monster. a lot can not do this! the graphics in this system is a 6teraflops and puts out some speed! more was this helpful? yes

mostly every game is limited to 30 fps still because of people playing on the older console is just plain stupid and a complete waste of money. i bought this console for better performance and if i can’t have that what is the point? i think microsoft should sell the one x for $400 and stop compatibility for older consoles. more was this helpful? yes no report contains spam or advertising
