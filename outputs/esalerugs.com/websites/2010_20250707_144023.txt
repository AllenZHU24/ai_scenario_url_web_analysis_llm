can a man compete with a machine? these are questions that plague every industry as technology improves and the need to cut back on manpower becomes an economic reality. the textile industry, once employers of millions across the world, is now almost fully automated. there’s no question that this helps the manufacturer. profit margins and production levels are both significantly higher using machines, but is quality sacrificed in the process? when it comes to carpets, aren’t handmade rugs superior? it may sound like a stereotype, but generally machine-made rugs are good solutions when you’re looking for something cheap and disposable, whereas handmade rugs are more of a long term investment. they go up in value, unlike their machine manufactured counterparts, and they are as a rule sturdier and designed to last a long time. if you buy a good hand-knotted rug from persia or the far east, you’ll get decades of use out of it in your lifetime and your children and grandchildren will get even more after you’re gone. there are documented cases of handmade rugs lasting hundreds of years. the potential for that hasn’t been seen yet with machine made rugs. there are benefits to buying machine made if you have small children in your home and want to have floor covering that you don’t have to worry about. some of the processes used today are pretty amazing. they make stain resistant, water resistant, and wear resistant carpeting that your kids can play on, spill on, and dump any number of vile concoctions on without you having to worry. even if they do damage the carpet you can buy another for a fairly affordable price. of course, a handmade oriental of persian rug can also be durable and child resistant. the craftsmanship that goes into making items that last for centuries didn’t develop without the craftsmen thinking about potential damage. even back in the 4th or 5th century bc when hand-knotting of rugs first began, they had children. take a look at the selection of handmade carpets in this website. you’ll see clearly that some are best for display and collection, but others are for more practical use. posted in quality, rug buying guides | no comments » why nain rugs are some of the most sought after in the world june 13th, 2010 in case you’ve been wondering, nain is a village in central iran, very close to the historically famous city of isfahan, former capitol of persia. nain rugs are some of the most distinctive and valuable to come out of iran, and definitely some of the most sought after in the western world. why are they so coveted?
