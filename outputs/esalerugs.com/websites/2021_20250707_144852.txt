will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any covered disputes. failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. the arbitrator

held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and unique, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. the arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief

representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. if any provision of the agreement to
