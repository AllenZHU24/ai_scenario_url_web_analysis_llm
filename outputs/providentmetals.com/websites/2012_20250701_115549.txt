market loss policy, which will include a fee as well as the price difference between your confirmed price and providentmetals.com's current ask price. return to top q: is there a minimum order amount? a: no. providentmetals.com welcomes orders large and small alike. return to top q: while placing an order i entered a coupon code and it didn't work. why? a: if your coupon code is not working, either: the coupon code has expired you are not logged in to your providentmetals.com account. to use a coupon code you must have an account and be logged in. login here, or if you have not signed up

multiple orders. you also cannot not subtract from one without being subject to our market loss policy. return to top q: are prices locked in when i order? a: yes. once your order has been confirmed, the prices of your items will be fixed. if you chose to pay by credit card your order will be put into the shipping queue immediately. personal checks, cashiers checks and money orders must postmarked within 1 business day. bank wires must arrive within 1 business day. return to top q: do you place items on backorder that you do not have in stock? a: provident will occasionally pre-sell items that we do not actually have in inventory if we have received a confirmed shipping date for them from our distributor. in that case, the expected shipping date from provident will appear in the quick overview section of the item's product page. this is the lone time that we will place an item on backorder. otherwise, provident only sells items that we have physically on hand. return to top q: my order's current status is "awaiting payment". what does this mean? a: this means you have selected either the wire transfer or personal check/money order/postal money order payment option and we are awaiting payment. if you selected wire transfer or money order, your order status will be updated to "confirmed payment" after we have received payment. for checks and money orders, your order status will be updated to "on hold" after we have received payment. return to top q: my order's current status is "on hold". what does this mean? a: this means that we have received your check and we are waiting the minimum 6 business days prior to updating your order status to "confirmed payment." return to top q: my order's current status is "confirmed payment". what does this mean? a: this means that we have received confirmed payment and that your order status will soon be updated to "processing."  typically these orders are sent within 3-5 business days, but may be later due to a delayed shipment or other unforeseen circumstances. please contact us with any questions. return to top q: my order's current status is "processing". what does this mean? a: the items you ordered have been physically pulled from inventory and are now being sent to the shipping department for further verification, processing, and packaging. usually this means the order will ship in less than 2 business days. return to top q: my order's current status is "shipped". what does this mean? a: this means that your order has left our facilities and is on its way to your address. it does not mean that your order has been delivered. return to top q: why are tracking numbers not provided on credit card orders? a: this is to protect both provident metals and our valued customers. recently, there has been an increase in fraudulent activity in the precious metals industry and providing tracking numbers only increased the possibility of falling victim to these criminals. return to top q: will i receive a 1099 with my order? a: no. this part of the health care bill passed in 2011 has been repealed. please contact your local congressperson if you would like to thank them or dispute any other part of this new bill. return to top q: what happens if there is an issue with my order? a: we pride ourselves on being the best in the industry and our customer's satisfaction is of the utmost importance. however, we are human and we do make mistakes on occasion. if we have made a mistake, please contact us immediately so we can remedy the problem. we also ask that you fax or e-mail a copy of the packing slip (our fax number is 877-429-8790) as well as email a picture of the label on the outside of the package so we can determine where this error occurred. it can take up to 2 business days to determine the cause of the problem and provide the correct resolution to our valued customers due to review of processes, inventory, camera footage and other proprietary security measures. return to top q: a product i want to purchase says "delayed" in the product name. what does this mean? a: the recent surge in demand has left some of our products with a "delayed" status or a specific date in both the product title and product description. this means that the product can still be ordered, but the shipping will be delayed by the number of days specified in each individual product. the us mint, along with the royal canadian mint and most private mints, have increased their lead times for delivery as they struggle to keep up with the increase in popularity of owning silver. return to top payment q: what forms of payment do you accept? a: payment type amount cash discount (what is this?) bank wire over $2,000 yes personal check orders $1-$20,000 yes cashier’s checks orders $1- $20,000 yes money orders orders $1- $20,000 yes credit card online orders $1-$1,500 call during business hours to place credit card orders over $1,500 credit card orders do not qualify for cash discounted pricing no if you would like to place a credit card order over $1,500, you will need to call during normal business hours of 8am - 6pm monday through friday. it will be subject to a $12.95 fee for restricted delivery. restricted delivery requires identification to be shown upon receipt of your package. these additional measures are being taken to protect our customers from fraudulent activity and to allow provident metals to continue to offer the most competitive prices in the industry. to avoid this fee and get a cash discount, please pay with a bank wire, money order, cashier's check, or personal check. return to top q: do you accept paypal payments? a: we regret that provident metals no longer accepts payments from paypal. in the past many of our customers enjoyed the convenience of being able to pay for their orders with paypal. however, paypal recently changed some important aspects of our relationship with them - we found these changes entirely unacceptable, so we decided to remove the paypal checkout option. our apologies to all of you paypal payments fans. but we encourage you to remember that we still offer several great payment methods, including credit cards, bank wires, and more. find out which payment methods we accept above. return to top q: do you accept debit cards? a: yes, we accept most debit cards. to qualify your card must have a visa or master card logo on it, and you must choose the credit card payment option during checkout. return to top q: what happens if i do not pay in full in the allotted time? a: if you do not submit payment within 1 business for bank wire payments or postmark personal checks, cashier's checks or money orders within 1 business day we may, at our discretion, cancel your order and implement the conditions of our market loss policy. your account will also be frozen until all of the associated fees have been cleared. return to top q: how do i get the wiring instructions? a: when you place an order with the wire transfer payment method, you will receive wiring instructions via email. customers placing orders within our normal business hours will receive the wiring instructions within 1 hour of placing the order. when an order is placed outside of normal business hours (at night, or over the weekend, or on a holiday), the wiring instructions will be sent the morning of the next business day. the transfer must be completed within 1 business day of order confirmation. return to top q: what is the cash discount? a: cash discounted pricing is available to customers who pay with a bank wire, money order, cashiers check, or personal check. customers who choose not to use cash-based payment methods still receive our industry leading list prices. the cash discounted pricing is just another way provident metals is striving to bring the best prices and service to you! each product page lists both the cash discounted and list prices side by side. default cart prices are displayed with the cash discount. there is also a link in the my cart page that allows you to toggle between the cash discount and list prices. return to top q: how do i qualify for cash discounted pricing? a: it's easy! just pay with one of these cash based methods: bank wire, money order, cashiers check, or personal check. that's it, no hoops to jump through, just pay using one of the cash based methods and save 2.99% off your entire purchase price! return to top q: do debit cards qualify for the cash discount? a: unfortunately, debit cards do not qualify for the cash discount. when a debit card is used to make a purchase online with any company, it is processed as a credit transaction through the visa or master card networks. it is therefore subject to the exact same fees as a credit card. because of this, we cannot extend a cash discount to customers using a debit card for their transactions. this is the same for every online business and is not unique to provident metals. return to top q: what is the list price? a: the list price is the price you will pay if you choose not to take advantage of the approved cash discount payment methods. see how to qualify for cash discounted pricing above. return to top domestic shipping q: what shipping options do you offer? a: a majority of orders are shipped via usps and are fully insured. all packages over $50 require a signature to be received. all packages shipped via usps will be shipped first class, priority mail, or express mail. all orders totaling $5,000 or more will be shipped usps priority registered mail. all packages are shipped securely in inconspicuous packaging that gives no indication of contents. boxes are addressed from "provident". some oversized packages may be shipped federal express or ups. if you have special shipping requirements or requests, please call and we will do our best to accommodate those needs. you may be notified by email when your package ships; however, we no longer provide package tracking numbers on credit card orders due to increased mail fraud. shipping rates are as follows: order sub-total shipping rate $0-$99.99 $5.95 $100-$499.99 $8.95 $500-$1,999.99 $11.95 $2,000-$4,999.99 $16.95 $5,000 + $24.95 return to top q: how long will it be until i receive my order? a: at providentmetals.com we pride ourselves on prompt shipping. in most cases, your order will be shipped within 3-5 business days once your payment has cleared. personal checks, cashier's checks & money order payments will be shipped once funds have cleared the bank, which is usually 6 business days, but may be as long as 12 business days. if you would like to pay via money order, we recommend usps money orders as they can be cleared faster than most other "mail in" forms of payment. as we primarily use the usps for shipping, your order will spend between 1 and 5 days in transit to your provided delivery address. return to top international shipping q: do you ship internationally? a: we now ship to canada! call 877-429-8790 today to get a custom quote from our trading desk. we do not currently ship to any other countries although we do have plans to add other

package on customs forms? a: yes, provident will always declare full value on all customs forms. there are no exceptions. return to top q: will there be any taxes or duties on my order? a: there may be duties and/or taxes on orders shipped to canada. all duties and taxes must be paid by the customer upon delivery. please consult a local customs broker for information about tax and duty rates.

provident. provident assumes no liability for your package until it has been signed for by a provident metals representative. registered mail is the safest way to ship anything. return to top q: what if the quantity of product i sell to provident metals is not the quantity i locked in? a: if the quantity of product is less than the locked in amount on your purchase order, you may be subject to market loss. if you adjust the quantity of product you've sold to pm because of changes in the metals markets, pm's market loss policy will be applied to your purchase order. if the quantity of

to provident metals is not up to the high quality standards people associate with provident metals? a: if the quality of the products you've sold are deemed unfit to purchase by pm's quality control department, you will be contacted with either an "adjusted" purchase price, or the product will be returned to you at your cost. the adjusted price will be based on the spot price you locked in at, however the premium will be adjusted., the florida united numismatists. return to top q: are there minimums or maximums when selling to provident? a: the minimum when selling to provident is $1,000. there are no maximums. return to top q: do i need to send a tracking number to provident after i've sent my items? a: yes. when selling anything over $1,000, provident needs to receive the tracking number the same day. on purchase orders of $1,000 or less, provident must receive the tracking number by the following business day. return to top precious metals ira q: why would i need a self-directed ira? a: for your future! iras are a useful way to save for retirement and they provide tax advantages like tax-deferred or tax-free growth depending on the type of ira you own. an ira is a vital addition to any investment portfolio, can supplement 401(k) accounts, and is recognized as an integral part of retirement planning. return to top q: i already have an ira. how can i invest in precious metals? a: if you already have an ira and your current custodian will allow an investment in precious metals, you can invest now by calling provident metals. if your current custodian does not allow precious metals investment, you can contact one of our preferred custodians and transfer funds penalty free into a separate ira. you can have more than one ira. return to top q: how do i fund a precious metals ira? a: investors have the ability to make contributions to their new ira or roll-over funds from an existing ira. contributions can be made via transfer or bank wire. a direct roll-over is the simplest way to set up a new precious metals ira if you already have an ira or 401k. you are able to roll-over or transfer any amount without penalty since this is considered a qualified transfer. all ira's (standard, roth and sep) are eligible for direct roll-overs. our preferred custodians are familiar with this process and can lend a hand. return to top q: what is the most i can contribute to my ira? a: individuals younger than 50 the maximum deferred annual contribution you can make is $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for couples. individuals 50 and older the maximum contribution goes up to $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for couples. annual contributions beyond the maximum allowable will not receive ira tax benefits. source: irs website return to top q: what's the difference between a precious metals ira and investing in an etf? a: real vs. paper assets. with precious metals iras you actually own the metals kept by your custodian. with an etf you are not able to take physical possession of the metals, which are considered a paper security, unless you own more than $100,000 worth of the funds' shares. the money you have invested in an etf can be lost if that etf were to be valued at zero and your investment would be gone. through the provident metals ira program you are able to physically take possession of your precious metals and you own something that has never been worth zero. return to top q: what are the costs to invest in a precious metals ira? a: the costs of the metals, setup fee, annual fee, and storage fee. the cost of the metals is as you see on providentmetals.com. the fees for precious metals iras are all charged by the trust and custodial company. when deciding upon a custodian you should ask about set up fees, annual fees, and storage fees. the fees will vary based on whom you choose as custodian. the two companies we have recommended are industry leaders, are extremely affordable, and there are no hidden fees whatsoever. return to top q: does provident metals have a minimum or maximum ira investment amount? a: provident metals does not currently have a minimum requirement for ira purchases, nor is there a maximum amount that a customer can purchase for their ira investment. keep in mind however, annual contributions beyond the maximum allowable will not receive ira tax benefits. source: irs website return to top q: i already own some ira accepted metals. can i place those metals into my ira? a: unfortunately not. precious metals purchased to be held within an ira must be funded via bank transfer or rolled over from another individual retirement account and immediately sent from the broker (provident metals) to the custodian. return to top q: what happens when my ira reaches maturity? a: it's up to you! provident metals will help you through the liquidation process if you wish to cash in or you can take physical possession of the metals if you like. return to top q: what are the approved investment grade metals that can be held in an ira? a: gold american gold eagle coins u.s. buffalo bullion gold coins canadian maple leaf gold coins austrian philharmonic gold coins
