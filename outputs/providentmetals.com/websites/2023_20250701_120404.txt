weight. the us mint also creates proof and burnished coins in this well-known series. canadian maple leaf gold coins: created by the royal canadian mint, these coins are the official gold bullion

the production of a 1 oz 24-karat gold bullion coin with a face value of $50 and a mintage of at least 300,000. thus, the american buffalo gold coin was born. this marked the first time the us mint
