palladium bullion palladium eagles palladium maples russian palladium more palladium palladium bullion at provident metals the focus of many investors is often immediately directed towards gold as a valuable metal investment, and an equal number express interest in silver as a component of a diversified investment portfolio. it’s natural for investors to gravitate towards these metals due to the plethora of coins, bars, and rounds available. however, there are other precious metals that also boast impressive purity and value. palladium, often overlooked as an investment, is gradually gaining popularity. a closer look reveals a growing number of palladium coins and bars in the market. modern palladium bullion coins two of the most popular palladium bullion coins represent esteemed coin programs globally, backed by respected sovereign mints and powerful central banks/governments. these two palladium coins are: canadian maple leaf: among the pioneering palladium coins, the canadian palladium maple leaf, part of the broader canadian maple leaf collection, was available from 2005 to 2007, 2009, and has been in production again since 2015. featuring the iconic sugar maple leaf on the reverse and queen elizabeth ii’s effigy on the obverse, these coins contain 1 troy oz of .9995 pure palladium with a face value of $50 (cad). notably, coins with an issuing date of 2024 and on, now feature the effigy of king charles iii. this marks the first time in the series that someone other than queen elizabeth ii has been featured. american eagle: the latest major palladium coin available is the american palladium eagle. authorized by the american eagle palladium coin act of 2010, it entered production on september 25, 2017. with 1 troy oz of .9995 pure palladium and a face value of $25 (usd), the palladium eagle showcases adolph a. weinman’s famed winged liberty design on the obverse and his american bald eagle design from the 1907 american institute of architect’s gold medal. brief history of palladium coins palladium coins lack the extensive history of gold, silver, or even platinum bullion coins. sierra leone issued the first palladium coin in 1966, followed by tonga in 1967. since then, countries such as canada, the soviet union, france, portugal, china, australia, and slovakia have issued palladium coins, mostly as special commemoratives rather than palladium bullion coins. in fact, the first major palladium bullion coin programs came in the form of the australian palladium platypus and the soviet/russian palladium ballerina. palladium bullion bars investors also have the option to acquire palladium bullion bars. well-known programs like the pamp suisse fortuna offer palladium bars, and various other palladium bars are available for purchase online. examples of popular palladium bullion bars include the following: valcambi palladium bar credit suisse palladium bar pamp suisse palladium bar pamp suisse fortuna palladium bar palladium rounds though far less common than silver rounds, palladium rounds have been issued in the past. one standout example came from johnson matthey and featured the images of lewis and clark. while the designs honored the anniversary of lewis & clark’s expedition to map the louisiana territory in the early 19th century, the release of these rounds also featured american-sourced palladium from the stillwater complex. brief history of palladium palladium, a rare and lustrous metal with a silvery-white appearance, belongs to the platinum group metals alongside platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston, palladium’s most extensive deposits are found in various locations worldwide. over half of the global palladium supply is used in catalytic converters in automobiles, converting over 90% of harmful gases from combustion engines into less noxious substances. other common uses include dentistry tools, electronics, groundwater treatment systems, and jewelry. buy palladium bullion from provident metals if you’re seeking increased diversity in your precious metals portfolio, palladium is a great option. please
