no other reason. should you at any time wish to stop receiving our printed catalog being mailed to your physical address, or our email newsletter and/or targeted promotional pieces coming to your

expiration date. when a customer enters a credit card number (through ssl encryption) the web page passes that number to a procedure that encrypts it before putting it into the database. the credit card number is decrypted only when the client downloads their orders through the admin tool. it is never decrypted into a database field. we use ssl, sftp or file encryption when transferring credit card data to the client's fulfillment system. the encrypted credit card data is wiped from our database after 5 days. we retain just the first digit and last 4 digits of the card# after 5 days." privacy & opt out information: we are committed to the responsible use of personal information for marketing purposes and our customer’s satisfaction. we also strive to provide offers and promotions for our products and services to individuals that are most likely to have an interest in receiving them. one way we do this is to contribute information about our customers to 3rd parties (note: we do not buy, sell, nor rent email lists. see our email privacy policy for our newsletter subscribers here.). in exchange, we receive additional information about our customers or new information about potential customers who may be interested in our products. by doing so, we are able to better understand our customer’s preferences and send relevant offers. direct marketing association mail
