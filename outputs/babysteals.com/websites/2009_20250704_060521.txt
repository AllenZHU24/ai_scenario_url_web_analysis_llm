why can i only find one product for sale? babysteals.com is a deal-of-the-day website, we sell one awesome product per day at 50%-80% off until it sells out. everyday at 9am mst another amazing 'steal' starts at a price so good that it's not just a deal, it's a steal! if you missed today's steal, check back after 9am mst for something new because it’s one-steal-a-day, baby! everything on your page is sold out. i really wanted the item, can i still order it? please! unfortunately, it sounds like you missed out on the steal. quick fingers are the key at babysteals.com! things sell out quickly and once the item is gone, it's gone. however, keep checking the steals or sign up for our daily steal alert, so you never miss a steal! do you accept returns? in a word, no. purchase accordingly! if you've changed your mind or have buyers remorse, save it for a gift! we do not accept returns because of the unique nature of our site. if there is a problem with your order, notify us within 3 days of receiving your order. all items are first quality, but if your item somehow arrives damaged we bend over backwards to get you a replacement or exchange. can i exchange something? remember, we're a deal-of-the-day website so that means we don't have another style or color to exchange it with. please order accordingly! can i purchase more than 3 items? you can purchase up to 3 items each style and size per day! the 3-item per style limit is so that people who really don't have triplets can’t steal it all! order more than that and you have to send us a picture of your quadruplets. i am having a problem placing my order. help! ordering issues are often related to firewalls or browser security settings. try ordering through a different browser or visit the google checkout buyer's help guide. if your question isn't answered there, email us the browser you are using and instructions on how to duplicate the problem. i placed an order and forgot to update my new address in google checkout. can you change the address? before you complete your orders, please confirm that your address information in google checkout is updated and correct. this will ensure you don’t get double charged for mailing to an incorrect address that was provided to us. if we are not sold out: please update your address in your google account, re-purchase your item and email us to cancel your original order if it is after the 15-minute cancellation period. if we are sold out: if you have not yet received your shipping confirmation, please email us a change of address request from your google account. this must be before your item is shipped but always within 1 hour of ordering. otherwise, it's probably too late. remember, we ship fast around here! i entered the wrong credit card and it will decline. help! 15 minutes after placing your order, google will email you if your card was declined with full instructions on how to fix your credit card information and confirm your order. until this happens and the card comes through approved, your order is not confirmed, nor on hold in our inventory. i finished my order but now want to change the size or color. can you change it for me? please re-do your order correctly and then cancel your initial order. if it is after the 15 minute cancellation window, you may email us once your second order is placed and we can cancel the first order for you. if we have already sold out, it is likely it's too late but email us at orders@babysteals.com and we'll see if we can help! i still have two items in my shopping cart but your site says it is sold out. are you holding those for me even though i haven't purchased them yet? nope. we can't confirm your purchase until you've completed the checkout process and purchased the item. having an item in your shopping cart does not guarantee you will receive the item. i just placed my order. how soon can i expect my steal? we want you to get hooked up with your steals fast and we do everything possible to ship your order the same day. many shipments arrive within 2-5 business days, depending on how far you live from salt lake city, utah. your order is shipped via usps with delivery confirmation. do you ship to canada? yes! via usps international first-class mail. duties are not included and declared based on the price paid for the item and the location that the product was manufactured. remember, canadian orders ship the same day but take 8-16 business days to arrive. more information here. do you ship internationally? at this time we only ship to the us and canada. can i store items in my shopping cart from previous days and buy them all at once to save on shipping? unfortunately not. we try to ship purchases the same day and most days we sell out. so if you didn't make the purchase on the day the product was for sale, odds are we don't have the item anymore. i just bought today's kidsteal or scrapbooksteal, and i know you're owned by the same company. can you please combine my order to save me shipping? not yet. we're working on the logistics to make this possible. i live in the salt lake city area; can i pick up my stuff and not pay shipping? you're in luck! to save mamas who live by us even more money, we offer local pick up at our office. we may even have a steal or two available for purchase there, right through google checkout! please visit here and read the details before using local pickup. question still not answered?
