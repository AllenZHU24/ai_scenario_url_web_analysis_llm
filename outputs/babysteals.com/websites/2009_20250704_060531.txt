(ok, she got in the crying part. you’ll see when you watch baby signing time 4.) you can even see a few tiny seconds of me (with much longer hair) wiping her tears and opening her can of pears. see for yourself, here are two cute videos of jane showing off her signs (hey, every mom thinks their kid is a genius, right? i’m no different!) well, now i’ve told you, mom to mom, and babysteals owner (who’s seen lots of baby products) to babysteals customer, the one thing i wouldn’t ever do without for my babies, is signing time. and other moms that work here at babysteals feel the same way. now you know! but, don’t take it from me. signing time fans, comment and give  moms the scoop! and consider this a fair warning. do not, i repeat, do not miss tomorrow’s steal. secret steals! december 11th, 2009 by { ♥jana } ∴ 6 comments » we keep getting feedback from our customers that they’re so jealous of the utah moms that can come to the store at our warehouse and buy babysteals!
