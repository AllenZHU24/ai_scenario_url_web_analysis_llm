out of respect for your inbox, we send one email alert at 9am, which includes a hint for the 9pm steal. i signed up for your email alerts but why am i suddenly getting them twice? did you recently place an order? chances are you checked the box "i want to receive promotional email from babysteals.com" and also checked "keep my address confidential.” when this happens, google creates a new email address that is anonymous to us but still forwards to your standard email address. if you're receiving duplicate emails from us, simply click “unsubscribe” from the email address you no longer want to receive the alerts. ordering everything is sold out. can i still order it?
