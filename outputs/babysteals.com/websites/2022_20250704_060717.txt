babysteals sidetracked! february 20th, 2009 by { ♥the moms } ∴ 2 comments » we’ve had such a fun time this week checking out all of your blogs. how do we find them you ask? easy! when you blog about us, we find out about it. so, thanks! your baby is darling, that color is perfect, we love the meme you did and what a cute first birthday cake! add a blog tag and tell your friends!  get one here. posted in: uncategorized lucky jade = lucky day for babysteals.com customers! february 18th, 2009 by { ♥the moms } ∴ 12 comments » lucky jade = lucky day for babysteals.com customers! there’s always a steal around here at babysteals.com, but yesterday’s was crazy! yesterday, our website listed an incorrect price for our steal of the day- the lucky jade cashmere blanket. we did not realize the pricing error until after we sold out, (serves us right for going out of town!) but as soon as we realized it we corrected the price, which was listed correctly on our email alert and rss feed. rest assured, everyone who got an order in before we sold out of the inventory will receive the blankets at the $18.90 price. yes, we’re serious. it was our mistake, not yours, so lucky you! i can’t tell you how many times i’ve ordered from online stores and thought i got a great deal, only to have my order canceled a week later because the price was incorrect. not here! your blankets have even already been shipped to you. because of the price mistake, the orders were coming in so fast that our order system could hardly update to say sold out fast enough. due to this popularity, we apologize to those of you that we had to cancel because the item oversold. we realize that changing the price after the steal was sold out confused some of you who visited multiple times yesterday, but it accurately reflected what the price was supposed to be, and kept it consistent for the people that visited our website after it was sold out. we try to be perfect around here but we’re human, so when we make mistakes we’re happy that it’s in your favor! posted in: uncategorized lucky jade cashmere blanket giveaway february 13th, 2009 by { ♥the moms } ∴ 61 comments » doesn’t your little one need something that is oooooooh so soft?  how about cashmere. we have one just for you! a lovely yummy soft lucky jade cashmere blanket! how to enter for your chance to win: become our fan on facebook! that’s it! if you are already our fan, you’re automatically entered to win. new to facebook?
