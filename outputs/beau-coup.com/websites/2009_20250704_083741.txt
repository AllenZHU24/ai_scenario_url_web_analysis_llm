from moving in to our first real office in downtown mountain view, california in 2005 to every major upgrade we make to the website - with a celebration. in 2009 beau-coup debuted on the inc. 5000 list of the fastest growing private companies in america. the company had achieved a 3-year growth rate of 243%, an accomplishment to which everyone contributed and for which we are all extremely proud. despite amazing growth, we still manage to celebrate every employee's birthday and anniversary with the company. we believe that life is a series of milestones to be celebrated and that favors are an important part of every special occasion. beau-coup is committed to providing an unmatched selection of high quality favors and gifts and exceptional customer service so that every celebration will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. we want to inspire our customers and help them find the perfect way to honor their achievements, and to thank their loved ones - to say merci beaucoup. our story the idea behind beau-coup originated from my experience as bride. my husband and i knew we wanted our guest favor to be something unique, something that reflected our interests and personality. like most couples, we pored over stacks of bridal magazines, surfed the major wedding websites, and visited numerous bridal shops for ideas. to our dismay, we seemed to come across the same set of products from vendor to vendor. we eventually decided to give our guests personalized golf balls (we love playing golf together!). the shopping experience was a difficult and frustrating one for us - we worked with three different vendors and spent many long hours packaging individual golf balls. we started beau-coup shortly after our wedding. having gone through the process ourselves, we knew there was a real need online for a one-stop wedding favors shop that offers unique and high quality items. and we also knew how stressful and emotional planning a wedding can be. beau-coup's mission is to help make the process a little less stressful, even enjoyable, by offering the most exceptional customer service and an unmatched selection of quality guest favors at competitive prices. i also hope you will be inspired by all the unique ideas on our website, whether it's how to tie the perfect bow or display your favors, we hope to make a difference. polly liu, founder contact us toll free: 877-988-2328 intl phone: +1-650-967-3700 email: info@beau-coup.com live chat: chat now! hours: m-f 7am-5:30pm pst about us press center testimonials notable clients charitable giving site map order info check order status info & faq international orders online catalog work with us jobs affiliate program for event planners our partners newsletter & offers sign up for news and special offers today! security & privacy | © 2010 beau-coup favors, inc™. all rights reserved.
