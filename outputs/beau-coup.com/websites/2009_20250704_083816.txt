longing for the beach and a warm, tropical place. a wedding in an exotic country several degrees warmer than here would be the perfect thing in the middle of winter to give your guests something to look forward to before spring arrives. when i saw these moroccan hotels, i could think of no better place to host an exotic themed wedding. especially a beach-side hotel. the draping curtains, intricate lanterns, and elegant columns would make for a truly breathtaking event. {images from: alkemie, that unreliable girl, southern weddings magazine, snippet & ink, stephanie williams photography} for your decorations, you could consider gathering small ottoman-like seats around small tables over persian rugs for the cocktail hour. plenty of bright flowers like orchids and lillies would make the perfect centerpiece, and don’t forget to spread plenty of rose petals inside any bodies of water available. {images from: wedding chicks, style me pretty, southern weddings magazine, style me pretty, project wedding, beau-coup round paper lanterns} for your event, be sure to provide plenty of entertainment, such as local dancers or a fire show to start things off. pay attention to details such as getting a traditional henna hand tattoo or providing some hand fans or leis. light the way with some moroccan lanterns, and pay tribute to your travels with a globe or a map. {images from: southern weddings magazine, style me pretty, southern weddings magazine, style me pretty, southern weddings magazine, junebug weddings, southern weddings magazine, style me pretty, style me pretty, santa barbara chic, project wedding, style me pretty, ruffled} some tropical fruit smoothies or cocktails would make the perfect treat to cool your guests down, and appetizers served over palm leaves and garnished with flowers would make the perfect meal for your reception. {images from: wedding chicks, southern weddings magazine, southern weddings magazine, style me pretty, project wedding, weddingbee pro} although traditionally, most brides wear white, i thought that for an exotic wedding it might be fun to play with color, whether that’s a vertical stripe down an otherwise white gown, or a traditional colorful sari. {images from: southern weddings magazine, ms. muse, that unreliable girl, junebug weddings, style me pretty, style me pretty, snippet & ink, project wedding} share filed under: inspiration, themes comment on this » ski lodge wedding inspiration january 8th, 2010 by silvia i’ve been posting a ton of winter wedding themes lately, but i just can’t seem to get enough and i hope you all feel the same! i am a huge fan of snowboarding and skiing and when i saw couples taking lifts up to their wedding venue, it seemed too perfect not to post! so, for today’s blog, we’re going to get some ski-lodge wedding inspiration. for this wedding theme, the inspiration comes from the slopes, so to get your guests in the mood, host your event atop a snowy mountain accessible by ski lifts or some sort of gondola. for a cozy reception a stone lodge would be perfect, especially it contains a roaring fire. {images from: classic bride, green wedding shoes, style me pretty, green wedding shoes, once wed, green wedding shoes, alkemie} to fit in with the cozy ambiance of the lodge, set up plenty of candles, both votive candles and lanterns. stick to a simple color palette– i personally like deep purple and use it sparingly within your decorations to add a bit of color. you might also consider twinkle lights to hang overhead. {images from: green wedding shoes, style me pretty, ruffled blog, style me pretty, weddingbee pro} to stay in theme, use lift tickets as escort cards, hang cute banners around the venue, and take giant group pictures around the lifts. give some sparklers to your guests in order to make a dramatic exit, and prepare some cute favor bags with some hot cocoa wedding favors or something equally as indulgent. {images from: green wedding shoes, once wed, style me pretty, once wed, ruffled blog, style me pretty} above all, make sure that your wedding attire is warm. you could purchase a long-sleeve gown or wear a cute cover-up such as a warm cashmere cardigan, a (faux) fur stole, or even a long winter coat in the color of your choice. dress up your bridesmaids in a pretty purple color and give them all shawls to wear over the gown. you might also want to wear boots or some other warm footwear– especially if it’s raining or snowing. i also love accenting your look with a lovely hairpiece. {images from: ritzybee, green wedding shoes, frolic, junebug weddings, style me pretty,  once wed, style me pretty, rock n roll bride} for the food, be sure to serve your guests some hot soup and plenty of warm things. for dessert try mixing it up with a dessert buffet featuring plenty of cookies, cupcakes, and chocolates to give your guests a treat. {images from: alkemie, style me pretty} share filed under:
