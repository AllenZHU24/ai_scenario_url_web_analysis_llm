(on a sunday evening). the very next morning i received an email from cassie. she tracked down my order, adjusted the quantity and assured me that i would receive my order in time for my daughter's baby shower. she then sent me an email with the order number and tracking information. that email went to my spam folder, and i, in my infinite wisdom, deleted it! once again i emailed her for help. cassie is true asset to your company. she returns emails immediately, is as pleasant as can be and most of all has the patience of a saint. too often people like cassie deal with the public and don't get the recognition they deserve. kudos to cassie for putting me totally at ease, as well as putting up with me. sincerely,cathy, wilmington, mai am very pleased with the order i made from beau-coup...everything came as specified. best, lisa, ontario, canadahello alexis, thanks a lot. it is really great news. you're a great company. will return. chris, charlotte, nchello, just wanted to drop a quick note to say how pleased i was with jacqui's assistance. she was great at handling my order and helping me expedite shipping so that it arrived on time for my event. my experience with your company was fantastic!
