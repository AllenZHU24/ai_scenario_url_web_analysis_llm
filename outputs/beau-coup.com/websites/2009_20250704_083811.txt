here, you're probably recently engaged and looking for ideas and advice on how to plan one of the biggest days of your life. whatever the details of your wedding, whether it's 40 people on a beach in hawaii or 300 people in a 5-star hotel's banquet hall one thing is the same...it's your day. every couple finds some way to put their personal stamp on their wedding day and we're here to suggest that the best way to do it is in the small details. after the venue has been booked, the wedding gown selected, the invitations ordered and the cake tasted, there are still a great many tiny decisions to be made and here's where you can have some fun! what music to you want to make your grand entrance to? what will your table names be? what will you get for bridesmaids gifts? and most importantly...what will you choose as your wedding favors? what are wedding favors? wedding favors are thoughtful mementos given by the newlyweds to their wedding guests as a symbol of gratitude for sharing their special day. the gesture can be traced back to ancient rome and has become a lovely custom in many cultures today. traditional wedding favors can be sugar-coated jordan almonds, or dragées which symbolize both the bitter and sweet moments of married life. more contemporary edible favors such as custom cookies and chocolate favors have become favorites of the modern bride and groom. today couples have a much bigger selection of guest favors to choose from. while most have received a picture frame, candle or wine stopper as a wedding favor less traditional fare such as personalized mint tins, tea party favors and even personalized hot sauce are becoming the standard. wedding favors can be anything you’d like them to be. the important thing is to choose wedding favors that reflect your personal bridal style and impart a meaningful message.are wedding favors necessary? though wedding favors, like everything else that goes into a wedding day, are optional we think they are a great way to thank your guests while allowing you to infuse some of your personality into the day. especially if they are personalized party favors. wedding favors are often placed at each wedding reception guest's place setting which lends to your décor. or they can be paired with your place cards thereby serving a dual function. some couples offer a wedding favors buffet and provide selections of their favorite wedding candy, snacks or a variety of trinkets. guests are invited to visit the buffet anytime and this becomes an opportunity for your friends and family to mingle. there are many great reasons for setting aside a part of your budget for wedding favors. unique wedding favors, shower favors and party favors unique and thoughtful wedding favors can leave a lasting impression and add a personal touch to the wedding reception. many couples are choosing wedding favors that celebrate their cultural wedding traditions and reflect their personal style.
