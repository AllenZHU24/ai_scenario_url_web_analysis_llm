view all | page123456789101112131415161718 alexis, again, many thanks for your understanding. as i stated, we will do a work around with distributing the cookies to our staff. our original plan was to do so at yesterday's staff recognition/holiday luncheon. i realize that there are many steps in preparing, processing and shipping a product. you certainly followed the protocols that are in place. well over 25 years ago, i had a position that put me on the front line of customer service. it takes a high level of skill, professionalism, caring and problem-solving to satisfy a diverse clientele -- all qualities that you have shown. best wishes for the upcoming holidays and a safe, healthy and happy 2011!helen, cambridge, mathank you so much! it's so nice to get such outstanding customer service! i do appreciate it. brenda, oakdale, mndear emily, i will do that! as soon as i get some feedback from the bride, her mother and other guests, i will let beau-coup know following andreas & emely's wedding on new year's eve, december 31, 2010 at the old church in tyreso, sweden (the "o" with two dots). in any case, maybe we (you and me) will have opened up another global market for beau-coup in sweden with so many beau-coup wedding gifts and favors to share with adde & emely's guests! i just updated my yahoo! address book with a contact entry for beau-coup favors, inc. and a contact entry for you. you may know that i am now a loyal customer. your founder, polly lui, and ceo, tom cole, must be very proud to be leading such an outstanding and successful organization! well done!! more to follow in january. in the meantime, have a wonderful weekend, emily. it's time for me to get packing my bags with all these fabulous beau-coup items! sincerely, patti, arundel, meemily, oh! you're the best! thank you so much for doing that!!! i'll be sure to order from you again and share this pleasant experience with friends! merry christmas!!! ashley, marietta ga i wanted to pass on a thank you for excellent customer service i had with tania at beau-coup.com. i recently placed an order for a corporate holiday party, and tania e-mailed me to verify the shipping. she noticed that i wanted a delivery date of about a week away, but did not check the 2nd day air delivery. she e-mailed me to explain this, which was really going above and beyond. today it seems like so many customer service representatives donít think for themselves, and just work by the book. it was so nice to have someone carefully look at the order and think about the big picture. i e-mailed her back, but it seems i still did not understand what the $33 charge was going towards. tania called me to explain this over the phone. i was really impressed. we could have sent e-mails back and forth all day, and she chose to be proactive and pick up the phone and call me. we got the whole thing worked out, and she even offered to give me an unsolicited 10% off the order, since it was so large. this was unbelievable, i was not unhappy and by no means was thinking that a discount was in order, but she was kind enough to offer. what a delightful person. annette, indianapolis, ini just felt compelled to write you a quick note. i had ordered some personalized flasks for my best friends from college, and unfortunately, there was a mix up with ups, and the package did not arrive. i spoke with mary rose, and she called ups, and did everything in her power to track them down. when it became clear that they weren't going to be found, i called to replace my order. mary rose updated the order, and let me know that beau-coup would cover the cost, and worry about tracking down the originals from ups. i can't tell you how much this means to me. in a time when few companies value customer service, i truly appreciate all your help! this was an important gift, and i felt that mary rose understood that. i am 25, and i seem to be helping plan a great deal of weddings lately. :) and you should know that beau-coup will get my recommendation every time! thanks again, and have a wonderful holiday season. sincerely,ellie, new york, nydear mia, thank you for your quick response to my dilemma. this is exactly why i always turn to your website for anything i need -- great service and great products. i was so satisfied with your prompt handling of my matter that i went back in to your website again and have already bought again, preparing for next year. enjoy a continued prosperous and healthy new year! susan lee, san francisco, cathank you, thank you, thank you! i really would like to tell you that your company has been much better than others that i have worked with. i am overseas (in madagascar, africa) and it is incredibly hard to communicate with other companies while placing orders - either e-mails are responded too late or not at all. also, it is frustrating that many companies cannot (or will not) provide personalization for names with accents (like my fiancť, noť). i was really disappointed, especially since there is a growing ethnic population in america. thank you again for your great customer service, speedy replies, and diverse products for diverse clients. i will really recommend your website and favors to others! sincerely, amy, madagascar, africacarrey, you are not only awesome. you are a life saver!!!ms. hill, mableton, gadear beau-coup, my fiancť and i just wanted to express our thank you for having exceeded our expectations! we recently ordered the personalized natural cotton favor bags and were incredibly impressed with the final product. not only was the shipment fast, but the favor bags looked impeccable. they completely captured the beach wedding theme we were going for and the price was unbeatable. we know our guests will love them as much as we do!
