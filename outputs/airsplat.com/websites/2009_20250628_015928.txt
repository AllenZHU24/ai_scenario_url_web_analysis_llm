it will prematurely wear out the seals and also cause the o-rings to freeze, damaging them permanently. instead, fire the gun until out of gas. this is the safe way to discharge a gas-gun. fire the gun in warm weather. using during the cold seasons are not advised. they will not cycle completely, fire well, and will use more gas than normal. rapid-firing of the gas-gun will also cause the gun to freeze up, resulting in damage to the magazine or gun. these problems are not as prone during the hotter seasons or warmer weather. use high grade bbs for your guns. lower quality bbs will tend to jam in the magazine well, preventing proper firing. marui, excel, airsoft elite, or airsplat bbs are are highly recommended. these are all models which we carry, airsoft bb. using .12 is not advised for higher end airsoft guns, such as electric or gas will void the warranty and may cause permanent damage. gas-gun care: be sure to keep your slide and all moving parts lubricated with silicone oil which can be purchased on our website or at your local hardware store. do not use anything else, such as petroleum based lubricants. only 100% pure silicone oil is required. other lubricants are not safe for use on plastic and rubber parts. do not use hoppes #9, wd-40, and other petroleum based lubricants will damage the guns permanently. be sure to also spray silicone oil into the top nozzle of the magazine well every 5-6 magazines uses. this is done, by pressing the top release valve on the the mag while putting a quick spray of silicone into the top rubber exhaust valve. this will keep the seals and o-rings properly lubed for a lifetime of use. for more details illustrations on how to maintain your gun, please refer to our maintenance guide. recommended gases for gas airsoft guns: kwc: use hfc 22 or green gas only for these guns. use with red gas will void the warranty ksc/kwa: use hfc134a gas unless equipped with a metal slide. if equipped with metal slide upgrade use hfc 22 or green gas. use with red gas will void warranty. western arms: hfc 134a gas is recommended. use with any other gases (such as hfc22 or green gas) with void warranty. kjw, y&p, stti, hfc, other taiwanese guns: hfc22 or green gas is recommended. using hfc134a is not powerful enough. use with red gas will void warranty. maruzen, marui: hfc 134a gas is recommended<. use with any other gases (such as hfc22 or green gas) with void warranty. marushin: hfc 134a gas is recommended. use with any other gases (such as hfc22 or green gas) with void warranty. tanaka: hfc 134a gas is recommended. use with any other gases (such as hfc22 or green gas) with void warranty. storing your gas-gun magazines: after usage please leave or insert a small amount of the appropriate gas, enough for 2 - 3 shots is recommended. do not keep them in storage while fully charged or completely empty. this will allow the o-rings of the magazine properly lubricated while in storage. shoot us!
