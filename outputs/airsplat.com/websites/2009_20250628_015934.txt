unbelievable. the product showed up packaged with care and all the products were just like described and some better. i ordered two throat mics (awesome by the way), one pair of boots, (awesome fit and look) and one dboys scar in black (came in original packaging and looked, felt, and was all around great.) not only am i completely in love with the customer service, shipping and handling of your website, i'm completely in love with the website. i have already told 10 people i play with out here about your site and plan to tell 100 others. great job, please please keep up the good work... customer for life, michael j. from ab 5/19/09 great experience. your prices are unbelievable. i've heard many positive things online and from friends. it's great to now be one of those who can attest to that. thank you for the great service. david e. from wa 4/22/09 my son was very adament about buying from airsplat. apparently all his friends bought from you. i admit, i was hesitant to go along with the hype. but after having dealt with your company, i now understand why you have so many loyal followers. you weren't kidding when you say nation's largest, you're like an amazon of airsoft, or walmart. prices are unbelievable once you start comparing. throw in the free shipping and it's a no-brainer. keep up the great work! joseph g from wy 3/5/09 everyone on my block loves airsplat! we have a team and we only buy from airsplat! you guys are the best! we compare prices and shipping all the time and every time you are the best priced and fastest shipping. ryan k. from co 2/28/09 you have great information on your site. after spending hours on your site just reading about airsoft i felt that i had the most trust in your company. jessica f. from fl 2/11/09 thank you! you have made my son's spring break. he was so excited to buy an airsoft gun and i told him to do his research. everyone kept saying airsplat, so we placed our order earlier this week. i'm so impressed with how quickly the order was shipped out and how professionally you have handled the order. a+!! michael r. from tx 1/20/09 i got my gun today and i love it! thank you for shipping it so quickly and having the best service. your prices are the best and i tell all my friends about airsplat. keep up the good work. page m from ca 12/10/08 i just want to say thanks for great customer service! i was getting jerked around by ups, who told me my shipment was lost this morning. your customer service personnel set up a 3-way call in which ups changed their story when she questioned them about a tracking entry that didn't make sense to her. suddenly my shipment was on a truck en route to me. as frustrated as i was, your customer service rep was kind, helpful, and professional to me, and very efficient and professional with ups. i will be a repeat customer! customer service is at least 50% of good business. oh, the items i ordered are great too, and the price was cheap. dave m from ny 12/01/08 i wanted to tell you how pleased i have been with your customer service. there was a problem in the web ordering in which the shipping changed from ups ground to ups overnight air. you corrected this problem for me quickly and with professionalism and i appreciate that. web dealers can sometimes be very difficult to deal with. you are the exception. neil p from pa 11/15/08 that's what customer service is all about. i really appreciate your prompt and professional response. i will be sure to inform all my friends that you are an excellent company that takes care of business the right way. thank you again and i looking forward to doing business with you again. joseph m. from tx 10/24/08 great vendor! i buy stuff from them on a regular basis for the past couple of years. along from several other online and store front shops. overall, i must say they are the most consistently best! they ship super fast, on par with big box retailers like target, walmart, amazon, etc. prices are the cheapest anywhere and they have a 110% price match guarantee. i used that feature once, worked great. in any case, in about 12 orders, one one of them had a back order and was shipped out the following week. but they were very good about sending me email updates. vince k from oh 9/22/08 thank you so much for the fast shipping and great response times to my emails. i will be coming back soon. i'm with you guys all the way!!! ryan k from va 8/13/08 i love you guys! everywhere is out of stock and you guys have everything in stock! it's great. i had 3 other orders with other companies that didn't ship, but you shipped it out the same day! you guys are the best! thank you for getting my order out so quickly and professionally. kevin g. from oh 7/03/08 i just want to say thanks for everything!! you guys really know what yall are doing when it comes to airsoft!!

christian r from nv 5/15/08 the airsoft gun i ordered was backordered, but 2 days later you got some back in stock and shipped it immediately! it arrived fast and for a great price! my mom didn't want to pay $110 for the gun and she had worries something would go wrong, but all went well without a hitch. thank you again! i'll be back, for sure! bryan g from mo 5/5/08 i have dealt with a lot of the airsoft dealers on the internet and have found that none compare to the level of all around quality of airsplat. i just wanted to say how much i appreciate your attention to the details including customer service which is beyond what i am used to. thank you airsplat, for your efforts, you have earned a loyal customer. jennifer j. from fl 4/24/08 this is a great store. i love the gun, small and powerful. also very cheap!
