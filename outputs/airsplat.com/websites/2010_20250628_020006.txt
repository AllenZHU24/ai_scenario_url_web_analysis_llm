airsoft is an informal term in reference to bb guns that use plastic bb's larger than the common bb's sold in local sporting goods stores which are 6mm in circumference. the difference/advantage is that with airsoft, players can safely train/simulate/play with weapons that appear identical to their real counterparts, but without the fear of serious injury. these toy guns both feel, look, and act like the real thing. they are both the same weight and size as the real things. the tops of these guns cock back (called blow back) when fired, like the guns in the arcade game point blanc. here is a small clip of a g17 and a usp. they also load and shoot small paint balls in addition to regular plastic pellets. more general airsoft information airsplat giving back to the airsoft community & supporting our troops and gi veterans airsplat cares about our troops airsplat gives back to the community about us: we are the nation's largest airsoft retailer!! we are a fully legalized corporation in the state of california. we have the world's largest airsoft inventory! we have a 20,000 sq. ft. warehouse where all our merchandise is in-stock and available to be shipped immediately! occasionally there will be specials deals and packages listed on our homepage. please check back regularly. also, we have a scrap yard where special deals and used guns are located. if you have any questions please e-mail us at info@airsplat.com or call us at (626) 357-5700. this phone number is only for questions regarding products, order status, or general purposes.the operator is not qualified to answer any technical support or rma inquires. if you have any comments or feedback you would like us to add to our feedback, we would love to hear them, please e-mail us at comments@airsplat.com. please do not email other inquiries to this email address. we are green (enviromentally friendly). our warehouse, procedures, and policy have been adjusted to be a green company. we recycle all trash at our facility and only use enviromentally friendly products to ship with. our packages are cushioned with thick crumpled craft paper that has been 100% recycled and won't cause a mess at your location upon opening. wholesale accounts available law enforcement or government agencies take care and happy shopping. airsplat team is here to help you! airsplat airsoft gun commercial more airsoft videos and airsoft gun reviews opportunities: current job opportunities (2) airsoft forum member sponsorship airsoft team sponsorship opportunities - airsoft team sponsorship application airsplat marketing contest $10,000 prize contact us: general information department - (info@airsplat.com) for general questions regarding products and merchandise order processing department - (sales@airsplat.com) for questions regarding orders already placed: such as tracking information, billing information, etc. technical support department - (support@airsplat.com) for help with merchandise already delivered feedback department - (comments@airsplat.com) for comments or feedback regarding airsplat * based on when this statement was made. * statstic provided by ups successful delivery status * survey conducted of 1000 customers supported by aim data services shopping cart 0 items $0.00 find us on: shoot us!
