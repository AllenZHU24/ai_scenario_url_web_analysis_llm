for returns made without the original receipt, a gift card will be issued in the amount of the current selling price of the item. (for example, if you purchased the item for $24.99 and now it’s selling for $18.99, the gift card issued to you would be in the amount of $18.99.)if the item(s) are no longer available, then a gift card will be issued at a fixed price, dependent on the item(s) being returned. the gift card will be mailed to your billing address for items returned to the distribution centre or issued in person if you make your return in store, and may be used either in-store or online for a subsequent purchase. can i still return item(s) if my purchase was made more than 45 days ago?

unfortunately, we are unable to accept any returned items without the tags attached. once the tag is removed, the garment is considered worn and not in condition to re-sell. can i use my order confirmation email in place of a purchase receipt? no, the order confirmation email is not considered a receipt of purchase, as it does not reflect the payment details that the store or distribution centre needs to process a return. how do i exchange an item i purchased online? you can exchange your purchase for another item in-store, even if the purchase was made online. however, if there are no store locations near you, you would need to return your original item(s) to the distribution centre and place a new order online for the alternate item(s). our warehouse doesn’t have the ability to process exchanges as they are not a retail store. do you offer gift receipts? gift receipts are not available for purchases made online, however, you may request one when making a purchase in-store. items that are returned in-store, accompanied by a gift receipt, are eligible for an exchange or a refund in the form of a gift card. can i return clearance or sale items?
