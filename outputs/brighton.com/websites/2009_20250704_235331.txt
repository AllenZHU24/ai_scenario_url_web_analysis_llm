"we have a business that is based on more than pretty products. it's built to last," said brighton's laura young. "we have sales associates who are passionate about our products, and we have consumers who appreciate our high quality and love to collect brighton. it's a sort of love story." it is fitting that brighton is known for its heart logo. a silver heart dangles from every handbag, and adorns many of the products in the collection. "the heart logo is so appropriate because we put our heart and soul into everything we do... from the attention to detail in the designs to the sales associates who sell our product (and even serve you a warm cookie!) to the way we stand behind our products," young said. the brighton brand has grown over the years through a strategy that young calls girlfriend marketing. "since we only sell to small stores run by nice people, women buy our products at stores where everyone knows their name and make them feel like they matter," young said. "they, in turn, tell their girlfriends about the cute brighton handbag that they bought, and so on and so on and so on!" products | accessories | eyewear | footwear | handbags | home & gifts | jewelry | ladies belts | luggage | wallets | watches e-cards | events | gift cards | special offers | store locator | wishlist | about us | career opportunities | faq | we're not perfect | privacy policy | contact us | winners
