advisory board press careers product submissions privacy policy terms of use california transparency in supply chains act contact us california transparency in supply chains act / u.k. modern slavery act at beachbody, llc and its affiliated companies, we recognize our role as the premier provider of world-class fitness and nutrition solutions for the at-home market. we can only maintain this role if we conduct business in an ethical manner, respect internationally recognized human rights, and not be complicit in any human rights abuses. we expect our employees, vendors and contractors to adhere to this standard as well and rely upon our vendors and contractors to do what is necessary to never participate in and work to eradicate the use of unethical labor practices in their supply chains. beachbody will at all times seek to comply with all applicable laws and regulations concerning human trafficking and slavery and, as a condition of doing business with our company, beachbody requires all its vendors and contractors do the same. this includes the requirement that our vendors and contractors take active steps to ensure that they too are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to employment conditions such as: (a) wage and hour, (b) child labor; (c) health and safety; (d) labor and workers’ rights and practices; (e) discrimination; and (f) environmental laws and regulations. beachbody ensures that each employee reviews and acknowledges beachbody’s business conduct and ethics policies through its employee guide, which also sets forth beachbody’s commitment to fair and ethical labor practices. beyond each vendor and contractor’s acknowledgment of its compliance with these critical standards, beachbody does not maintain specific procedures for ensuring that its vendors and contractors comply with beachbody’s expectations for ethical labor practices. currently, we do not engage in verification activities to evaluate and address the risk of trafficking and forced labor in its supply chains; we do not conduct independent, unannounced audits of its vendors and contractors to evaluate their compliance with our expectations for ethical labor practices; we do not require its vendors and contractors to certify that materials incorporated into our products comply with anti-trafficking and forced labor laws; and we do not routinely provide training on trafficking and forced labor issues. when we identify areas of non-compliance, our goal is to work with our vendors and contractors to help resolve issues, improve compliance, and promote better working conditions. that said, we have a zero tolerance policy for significant violations such as the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking and any such violation would result in termination of our business relationship with the offending vendor and/or contractor. this statement is made pursuant to the california transparency in supply chains act of 2010 and section 54(1) of the modern slavery act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the fiscal year ending december 31, 2016. updated: june 2017 free
