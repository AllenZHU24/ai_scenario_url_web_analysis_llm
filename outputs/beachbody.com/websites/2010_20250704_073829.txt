the age of 13. if we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information on a child under the age of 13, that information will be deleted from our systems. beachbody encourages parents to go online with their kids. here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: teach kids never to give out personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. this includes their name, address, phone number, school, etc. know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. look for web site and other privacy policies. know how your child's information is being treated. what information does beachbody collect?in collecting your personal information, we aim to provide you with a more customized experience. this information lets us provide services and features that we think are more likely to meet your needs. of course, users may be able to use our products or services or browse our web sites without providing any personal information, but once you give us this personal information, you are not anonymous to us. beachbody collects two types of information when you visit our web site(s) or you do business with us via any medium: information that may be used to identify you individually, such as your name, physical address, phone number, and email address ("personal information"); and nonpersonal information, such as ip addresses, the type of browser you are using, and aggregated information about user activities on our web site(s) ("nonpersonal information").personal information: we specifically request personal information from you at certain points on and off our web site(s). for example, when you sign up for our newsletter, subscribe to our web site(s), or when you purchase an item or service, we collect personal information to complete the transaction. this information may include, without limitation, your name, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card information. if you apply to join our affiliate program, we may collect information about your business, including, without limitation, your (or your organization's) name, email address, street address, telephone number, tax identification number, and information about your web site (e.g., the url, the number of unique users and page views, the demographics of your user base, etc.). from time to time, we may also request personal information about you and your interests in surveys, contest entry forms, or in other ways. you may always choose not to provide us with your personal information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific product or service, or to offer you personalized content. nonpersonal information: when you visit our web site(s), we also collect nonpersonal information, such as your ip address, which is a number that can be used to identify your location and internet service provider. we may also collect the url from which you came to our web site(s) and the urls visited on our web site(s). a url is the full address of a web site page, which may contain some personal or identifying information about the person who is viewing it. information we obtain from other sources: we may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices/applications and third-party services) and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). for example, if you access third-party services (such as facebook connect) through or in connection with our web site(s), we collect information available about you through those services, including, but not limited to, personal information as well as publicly observable data, such as activities on blogs, videos, and other online postings.use of cookies: we also use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. the unique user id contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computerâ€”but not youâ€”to our servers every time you visit our web site(s). cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, but may be correlated with identity information in our log files. you can turn off the cookie feature by using your browser preference options, but you may not be able to utilize some services properly. current versions of many web browsers offer enhanced user controls for the placement and duration of cookies. search for "cookies" under your web browser's help menu for more information on the cookie management features available to you. use of pixel tags: we also collect information through the use of "pixel tags" included in email messages we may send to you. pixel tags, also known as "web beacons," are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in html-encoded email messages. when such a message is opened in an html-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the email message, the fact that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving html-encoded email, and other standard logging information. the pixel tag may also see or read cookies. beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, to track visitor behavior to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. you can disable the pixel tag feature by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.how does
