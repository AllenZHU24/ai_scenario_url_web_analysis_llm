discounts earn credit rebatestoward your next order click here to join our email list and get 15% off your first order* *restrictions apply. click for details. free shipping for most orders over $50 we offer free shipping to the continental united states for orders of $50 or more (excluding alaska, hawaii and us territories). for certain overweight and oversize items some restriction apply. this is noted in the product descriptions of these items. we pay a portion of shipping charges for customers who choose faster delivery methods, like ups 2-day, and we also offer great rates on 3-day shipping. our goal is to keep all your shipping costs as low as possible. complete bikes* — complete bicycles ship at a flat rate of $79.99 to the us excluding alaska and hawaii, us territories, and ae/apo boxes. *giant and liv connect bike purchases: customer consents to sharing their information with giant usa for bike and warranty registration. required by giant usa for all weblink giant connect bike purchases. orders ship the same day we receive them our website uses a real-time inventory management system and the products on our site are in stock in our warehouse and ready for immediate shipment, unless otherwise indicated (such as backorders). domestic orders received before our shipping cutoff monday through friday (except holidays) ship the same day. our same-day shipping cutoff is 3:00 pm pacific / 6:00 pm eastern. apo/fpo and international orders often require customs paperwork to be completed that may delay shipment by one business day. bicycle orders — orders for complete bicycles will ship within 48 hours unless placed on a friday, in which case they will ship by end of day the following tuesday. this is due to requirements from our brand partners that all bicycles be assembled on site and re-boxed for shipment to the customer. how we ship we offer ups and usps delivery options. during checkout, you can easily see all available shipping options for your order and location. just input your zip/postal code (or country for orders outside the usa and canada), and you'll receive an instant quote for all available shipping options to your location. free shipping option — orders that qualify for our free shipping will ship using ups ground, usps first class, usps ground advantage, or usps priority mail, depending on the weight and size of the package. alaska, hawaii — shipments to alaska and hawaii do not qualify for free shipping, but we do subsidize our shipping costs to offer the best rate we can. the shipping discount will depend on the size of the order, so larger orders (particularly lightweight items) will lower shipping cost. some items, such as co2 cartridges, spare batteries, etc., can only be shipped via ground shipping. for orders containing any of these items, air shipping options will not be offered. shipping to temporary addresses biketiresdirect will ship packages to any verifiable address input at checkout (including temporary addresses such as hotels, homestays, short-term residences, travel accommodations etc.). however, we cannot guarantee a specific arrival date, nor can we recall packages once they are out for delivery or have been delivered. if a package has been delivered to a temporary address after the customer has vacated that residence, the customer is responsible for all costs related to retrieving the package from the temporary address. lost or unretrievable packages shipped to a temporary address are not eligible for refunds. if a product is needed by a certain date, please contact our customer service department before ordering, or consider purchasing locally. apo/fpo and international shipping for many customers with apo/fpo or addresses outside the continental us, the usps offers the most cost-effective shipping methods. ups worldwide express is quick, provides tracking information, and includes the customs brokerage fee in the shipping cost. customers shipping to some international destinations may have the option to ship via usps international airmail parcel post, which takes less than two weeks to reach many destinations and may be a cost-effective option. international orders may take a little longer to process than domestic shipments due to the additional requirements involved. duties and taxes — please note that customers may also be required to pay import duty, local taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). these are collected at the time of delivery. because import duties, brokerage fees and local taxes are applied by the destination country, we are not able to provide estimates or quotes for these additional fees. please consult your local government for additional information about these fees prior to placing your order. we attach an invoice to the outside of the shipping box with a detailed description of the products in order to facilitate customs processing, but delays are still possible during the customs process. please note that international customers are responsible for all return shipments to us, including warranty claims. all products must be returned at the customer's expense in order to be refunded or warrantied. to help facilitate the return process and accelerate resolution, all international returns will be processed as refunds. we regret that we cannot offer exchanges on international returns, but our goal is to issue refunds as quickly as possible, allowing customers to make a replacement order at their convenience. shipping performance and restrictions we offer estimated delivery dates for each shipping option. though these are only estimates, we've found that ups meets or exceeds their delivery estimate 97% of the time. ups only guarantees delivery on or before the estimated date for next day air. combined with our efficient same-day packing and shipping, we offer one of the fastest and most reliable delivery services available. please note that items ineligible for air shipping, including co2 cartridges, aerosol lubricants, and other volatile materials, are thus also ineligible for expedited or international shipping. will-call & curbside pick-up available orders may be placed online for pickup at our warehouse in portland, oregon. will-call orders placed before 3:00 pm pacific time, are available to pick up within one hour of placing the
