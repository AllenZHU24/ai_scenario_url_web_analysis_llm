policy we offer a 60 day return policy on all products returned to us in new (unused) condition. after 60 days, products in new condition may be returned for store credit within one year of the purchase date (see exceptions below). we cannot accept returns of nutritional products after 60 days or once product has been opened. closeouts, open box, and b-stock items can be returned for store credit only within 60 days of purchase. no returns are accepted on these items after 60 days. if you request a refund to your credit card or paypal account, we will assess a 5% restocking fee to cover our transaction fee expenses with those payment processors. to avoid this fee, simply request a store credit instead. used product (if accepted) is only eligible for store credit and will be subject to a 20% restocking fee and any other applicable fees. store credit is issued in the form of a gift code and expires in 1 year from issuance. apparel return policy apparel returns will not be accepted for items with missing or removed care tags. for warranty concerns regarding items missing care tags, please contact customer service for assistance. bike and framesets policy bike and frameset returns must be authorized by customer service. please contact our cs department if you wish to return a bike or frameset: (800) 682-0570. bikes and frames are not eligible for returns if they have been test ridden, used, had parts/accessories installed or been exposed to any elements (dirt, rain, mud, etc). bikes and frames must be returned in original box with the original packaging applied. all complete bikes and framesets are subject to a 10% restocking fee. for continental us returns, a return shipping label is available for $130 for complete bikes and $30 for framesets. defective product return policy if you've received a defective item, please return it to us within 60 days. we'll replace it for you with the same item if the product is currently in stock, or make arrangements to get a replacement item to you. after 60 days, we can help you with manufacturer warranty support. the return policy for defective products are subject to the policies of the manufacturer. should the manufacturer's policy dictate that you work directly with them, then that is the policy we will follow. what does 'new condition' mean? new condition means the item and all packaging including accessories, boxes, manufacturer tags, and manuals must be returned to us in the same condition as shipped to you. electronics must have all factory packaging, screen protectors, cables, and accessories, and must not be set up or programmed. basically, the item needs to look the way it did when it came to you. to prevent damage to the products, please open boxes carefully. try shoes on a carpeted floor and don't mount cleats until you are comfortable with the fit. please wrap saddle rails with electrical tape before attaching to the seatpost to avoid scratching the rails. taping and or applying labels to original packaging will invalidate the product as "new" and be subject to the restocking fee of 20% as used product. how to process a return we've now made it easier for you to start the return/exchange process. when you view your previous orders, you should see a button that reads return items for orders eligible for return. clicking on this button will allow you to specify which items you would like to return, as well as the reason for the return. you will then be able to print a return shipping label and see any credit/refund you might get, including vip points (more information about vip points below). the charge for return shipping is $9.95 for most items. items damaged in shipping, broken on receipt, or incorrectly shipped will not be charged return shipping. we're sorry, but heavy and/or oversized do not qualify for flat-rate shipping and will be charged our discounted shipping rate. exchanges - usa we know it's often difficult to know what size shoe or
