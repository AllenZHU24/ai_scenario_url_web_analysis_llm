orders over $100 we currently offer free ups ground shipping to the continental us (not including alaska and hawaii or us territories) for orders of $100 or more. certain overweight and oversize items are excluded. this is noted in the product descriptions of these items. shipping charges for smaller orders, other locations, and air freight shipping options, are discounted for larger orders. the more you buy, the more you save! use our shipping quote to see the shipping price for the items in your shopping cart. shipping quote we use united parcel service (ups) and us postal service for all of our shipping. during checkout you can see all available shipping options for your order and location. you can get an instant shipping quote by clicking on the button on any product page. once you input your zip/postal code (or country for orders outside the us and canada), you'll receive an instant quote for all available shipping options to your shipping location. we use ups for shipments to the lower 48 states and puerto rico. this is the most cost-effective choice for most packages, and usually the quickest delivery. for alaska and hawaii, usps priority mail is also available and may be less expensive. for all shipment options, you'll see an estimated delivery date. this date is based on estimated delivery times provided to us from ups and usps. we try our best to get your order to you in the estimated time. ups meets their delivery estimates on approximately 97% of our shipments. usps does not provide us shipment delivery statistics, but they are generally fairly good at meeting their delivery estimates except in high volume times such as before christmas. we cannot ship co2 cartridges (including inflators that come with cartridges) or any volatile materials, such as certain lubricants, via air. international shipping for international shipments, usps international airmail parcel post is often the most cost-effective service. it usually takes less than two weeks for most shipments to reach locations such as australia, new zealand and europe. we also offer ups worldwide express, which is typically faster than usps, provides tracking information, and includes the customs brokerage fee in the shipping cost. you may also be required to pay import duty, local taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). these will be collected at the time of delivery. please check with your local authorities to determine the amount before ordering. we attach an invoice to the outside of the box with a detailed description of the products to reduce customs delays, but occasionally orders are still delayed in customs for up to several weeks. our most popular articles 26 inch cruiser tires about us all about gear inches bicycle lights bicycle parts bicycle wheels
