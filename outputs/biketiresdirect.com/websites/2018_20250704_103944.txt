skewersrim tapewheel accessories join our freevip club to receiveadditional discounts earn credit rebatestoward your next order shippingfree shipping for orders over $50 we offer free shipping to the continental us (sales tax is collected in washington, free shipping does not include alaska and hawaii or the us territories) for orders of $50 or more. certain overweight and oversize items are excluded. this is noted in the product descriptions of these items. if you choose a faster delivery method, like ups 2-day, we also pay a portion of that shipping charge, and we offer great rates on 3-day shipping. our goal is to keep all your shipping costs as low as possible. the more you buy, the more you save! our shopping cart makes it quick and easy to see all your options. orders are shipped the same day we receive them our website uses a real-time inventory management system and the products on our site are in stock in our warehouse and ready for immediate shipment. domestic orders received before 3:00pm pacific time, monday through saturday (except holidays) ship the same day. apo/fpo and international orders often require customs paperwork to be completed that may delay shipment by one business day. how we ship we offer ups and usps delivery options. during checkout, you can easily see all available shipping options for your order and location. just input your zip/postal code (or country for orders outside the usa and canada), and you'll receive an instant quote for all available shipping options to your location. we only display available shipping options, and if a faster method is available for free, we won't bother displaying the slower method. economy shipping for residential orders (orders shipping to your home instead of a business), our economy shipping is a great option. economy shipments are typically shipped using ups surepost, a ground service that uses your local u.s. postal service for the final delivery step to a residential address. ups picks up the package from our warehouse and delivers it to your nearest u.s. post office, where it is then delivered by your postal carrier. ups tracking is available on surepost shipments until they reach your local post office. ups surepost does not provide a guaranteed delivery date, but typically takes 2-3 days longer than ups ground. ups surepost can be delivered to p.o. box addresses as well as fpo and apo addresses. packages shipped economy still leave our warehouse on the same day we receive the order for orders received before 3:00 pm pacific time monday-saturday (except shipping holidays). usps priority mail priority mail shipments received before 3:00 pm pacific time monday-saturday (except shipping holidays) ship the same day. in many cases, priority mail from the united states postal service is delivered in 1-3 business days (including saturday) and offers an economical way to expedite shipments. however, unlike ups shipping methods, priority mail does not have a guaranteed delivery time. the delivery estimate we provide is based on the typical transport time provided by the postal service. ups ground thanks to its proven track record and easy tracking, ups ground is still our go-to service for many orders. most ground shipments reach any location in the continental us in five business days, and offer the peace of mind of ups guaranteed delivery. ups expedited for faster delivery with a guaranteed delivery date, we also offer low shipping prices on ups expedited services, including 3-day, 2-day, and overnight options. if your order is over $100 and you require expedited shipping, we pay part of that shipping to help keep the costs down. alaska, hawaii shipments to alaska and hawaii do not qualify for free ups ground shipping, but we do subsidize our shipping costs to give you the best rate we can. apo/fpo and international shipping for many customers with apo/fpo or addresses outside the continental us, the usps offers the most cost-effective shipping methods. ups worldwide express is quick, provides tracking information, and includes the customs brokerage fee in the shipping cost. customers shipping to some international destinations may have the option to ship via usps international airmail parcel post, which takes less than two weeks to reach many destinations and may be a cost-effective option. international orders may take a little longer to process than domestic shipments due to the additional requirements involved. please note that you may also be required to pay import duty, local taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). these are collected at the time of delivery. because import duties, brokerage fees and local taxes are applied by the destination country, we are not able to provide estimates or quotes for these additional fees. please consult your local government for additional information about these fees prior to placing your order. please check with your local authorities to determine the amount you may need to pay before ordering. we attach an invoice to the outside of the shipping box with a detailed description of the products in order to facilitate customs processing, but delays are still possible during the customers process. please note that international customers are responsible for all return shipments to us, including warranty claims. all products must be returned at the customer's expense in order to be refunded or warrantied. to help facilitate the return process and speed up your resolution, all international returns will be processed as refunds. we regret that we cannot offer exchanges on international returns, but our goal is to issue your refund as quickly as possible, allowing you to place a replacement order at your convenience. shipping performance and restrictions we offer estimated delivery dates for each shipping option. though these are only estimates, we've found that ups meets or exceeds their delivery estimate 97% of the time, and guarantees delivery on or before the estimated date except during the holiday season. combined with our efficient same-day packing and shipping, we offer one of the fastest and most reliable delivery services available. please note that some items, including co2 cartridges, aerosol lubricants, and other volatile materials, cannot be shipped via air, and so are not eligible for expedited or international shipping. hold for warehouse pickup orders can be placed online for pickup in our portland, or warehouse. orders placed before 3:00pm pacific time, monday through friday, are available to pick up at the warehouse within one hour of placing the order. our warehouse is located at 5741 ne 87th ave, portland, or 97220. the warehouse is open for pickup from 11:00am to 5:00pm
