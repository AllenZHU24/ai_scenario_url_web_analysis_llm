30c for racing and training, 32c - 40c for commuting and 35c - 50c for smooth fast gravel. mountain bike tires offer significantly more robust traction and tread for trails, dirt, rocks and mud and are most commonly found in 29", 27.5", and 26" sizing with anywhere from 2" to 3" widths. for more information on tire sizes, check out our tire size chart. inner tubes, while largely relegated to backup status by modern tubeless gravel and mountain bike tires, are still very much an essential component to most road and commuter riding and are are available in a wide variety of sizes to fit the needs of just about any type of rider. if you want to learn more about different kinds of inner tubes and valve types, visit our tube guide. across all disciplines, tires are available in a wide range from fast, to durable, to grippy, to smooth, to extremely puncture resistant. whether you are looking for road, gravel, mountain bike, commuter or bmx tires, our customer service team is ready to help you find the right tire for your bike. shop by brand we are committed to delivering outstanding value and service to our customers, every day. try us today to see why so many of our customers come back again and again. *orders received before 3:00pm pacific time are shipped the same day (mon-fri). orders over $50are shipped free (usa only, excluding ak and hi). some exceptions apply. see shipping for details. 1 links about us careers affiliates live chat contact us our store articles shipping returns price match do not sell my personal information privacy accessibility categories accessories apparel bags bikepacking bikes | frames | forks components hydration | nutrition helmets computers | electronics lights pumps | inflators saddles shoes tires | tubes tools | lubes trainers | rollers wheels youth subscribe want to save on all your bike tires direct purchases? sign up here for exclusive discount offers. enter your email address to receive our newsletter sign up for emails 5741 ne 87th ave (i-205 exit 23b) portland, or 97220 | 800-682-0570 | [email protected]
