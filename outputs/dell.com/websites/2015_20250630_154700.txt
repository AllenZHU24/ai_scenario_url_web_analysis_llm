why choose dell? what we offer customer stories insights are the best medicine – are you future ready?insights are the “a-ha” moment in healthcare, the point when we clearly see the path forward — to the right diagnosis; to the best treatment; to the patient-centered care every person deserves.while insight depends on data, the challenge for healthcare is not a lack of data. just the genomic data needed to treat new cancer patients is now measured in exabytes, a metric that equals a million terabytes. what healthcare organizations need are the systems, tools and analytics to effectively manage, integrate and analyze the deluge of data and deliver insights where they are most needed. as the number one healthcare technology services provider six years in a row, dell can provide the people, processes and technology to help you find the insights you need for your work today and the vision you need to create the healthcare of the future. video: how technology is making healthcare
