gaming is better than ever on windows 10, with games in 4k, directx 12 and streaming your gameplay.* breaking new benchmarks. again. the world’s most powerful laptop just got an upgrade. with extraordinary desktop-level processing power, cpu and gpu upgradability, advanced cooling and a premium, revolutionary design, the alienware area-51m r2 is a true desktop-gaming experience in the form of a laptop. unprecedented power & performance new firsts in power: the area-51m r2 features a host of firsts for peak performance and power. it’s our first-ever laptop to feature overclockable 10th gen intel® core™ i9k desktop processors, support for up to 125w of power, and 10-core desktop cpu options, giving it a whole new level of compute power versus other gaming laptops. greater graphics and gameplay: experience vivid, uninterrupted gaming and faster frame rates during high-powered gameplay thanks to overclockable nvidia® geforce® rtx™ graphics or, for the first time in the area-51m r2, amd radeon™ graphics (coming fall 2020). now featuring a new 300hz fhd display option, you can expect the smoothest fast-paced gameplay and the best 17" front-of-screen experience imaginable.massive memory: the area-51m r2 is also alienware’s first gaming laptop to support up to 64gb of ddr4 memory at 2933mhz or 32gb of ddr4 xmp memory at 3200mhz. this ensures enough ram for even the most resource-intensive workloads and tasks, making it ideal for gaming developers, content creators and megatasking streamers. advanced cooling & performance updates the area-51m r2 features all-new engineering efforts to increase thermal capacity and performance. it now offers three different cooling solutions and power management techniques based on your graphics selection. every one of these new features is engineered to enable the higher wattage requirements of our new updates and their respective overclocking expectations.hyper-efficient voltage regulation is a technology developed by the alienware engineering team to enable maximum performance for extended amounts of time with safeguarded thermal conditions. for the first time ever in a gaming laptop, the area-51m r2 features a 12-phase graphics voltage regulation option, ensuring alienware’s highest sustained graphics performance ever.vapor chamber cooling technology uses advanced methods to efficiently dissipate heat from extreme-performance graphics options. these chambers utilize the phase-changing nature of liquid to transfer heat more effectively than a solid piece of metal or copper heat pipes. vapor chambers are also more versatile than copper heat pipes in that they can be spread evenly across an entire chip that needs to be cooled.10% larger fan blades than the previous generation of the area-51m r2 are available on both the amd® (coming fall 2020) and nvidia® options, ensuring high-performance graphics cards receive enhanced cooling when the action heats up. iconic design with a modern edge the alienware area-51m r2 raises the bar for innovative engineering with its game-changing design. the visual identity was inspired by our early industrial designs, marking a return to form while taking cues from our original roots.the futuristic design of the area-51m r2 reflects the diverse, evolving nature of gamers everywhere, incorporating high contrast, performance-focused engineering with blended bone lines, angled sections, bold lighting, and celebrated thermals. bold lighting: the latest evolution of alienfx lighting features a striking ring of light at the rear of the system, highlighting system performance while maintaining ultimate customizability.narrow bezel: the area-51m r2 features a drastic reduction of screen borders thanks to its narrow bezel with a three-knuckle hinge. this reduces the mass and maintains a strong connection to the base. premium shell: the unique magnesium alloy exoskeleton enables enhanced rigidity, while reducing overall chassis weight. this allows more space for high-performance components inside the machine.dual color options: gamers can choose between a new, futuristic look in lunar light or dark side of the moon, a darker, more traditional appearance. game-enhancing features advanced keyboard: with the alienware tactx keyboard, n-key rollover technology enables over 108-key commands for maximum actions per minute and 1.7mm of key travel allows for rapid response for any keystroke. per-key alienfx lighting delivers customizable lighting profiles, while programmable macro keys let you create gaming and non-gaming shortcuts for over 150 game titles.2.5gbps ethernet: the area-51m r2 features a 2.5gbps bandwidth ethernet connection, giving gamers 2.5x the amount of common wired ethernet connections for blazing-fast file transfers.thunderbolt™ type-c port: this multi-use port is ready to be used as a usb 3.1 port, offering 10gbps of data transfer, a thunderbolt™ connection capable of 40gbps, or even a displayport enabling various monitors supporting the displayport protocol.enhanced storage: the area-51m r2 can support up to 4x ssds for massive storage and redundancy options with raid5
