employee with 24 hours of paid time off each year to volunteer with a local organization of their choice. in 2013, buildasign.com spearheaded the creation of philanthropitch, a fast pitch forum for austin’s most promising nonprofit organizations looking for access to financial capital. the high energy event serves as a platform for local organizations to present a specific need that will
