our most commonly asked questions: may i choose the type of material my design is printed on? yes, you can choose any material you like from the wide variety we sell. some of our most popular materials are: banner, aluminum, corrugated plastic, art board, magnetic and bumper sticker.note: corrugated plastic is a lightweight plastic produced like corrugated cardboard, except corrugated plastic is white and durable outdoors. our corrugated plastic is 1/8" thick, and it is a great option for an inexpensive, quality yard sign or outdoor advertisement. how will my oversized corrugated plastic signs ship? we do make modifications to some products in order to reduce cost to our customers. for instance, our 4'x4', 4'x6', and 4'x8' corrugated plastic signs cannot be shipped at ground shipping rates; they must ship freight which is a far more expensive for smaller orders than ground. to enable orders with quantity 9 or less large corrugated plastic signs to ship at ground shipping rates, we must slit the back of the boards in one or two places so that they fold to a shippable size. once delivered, the signs can be easily unfolded to their original width. note: orders with quantity 10 or more will ship flat and use freight shipping at cost to the customer. what is my turnaround time? we can get you your signs as soon as 1-2 business days, but we let you choose how quickly you want your signs when you’re checking out. your choices for delivery times will usually range from 2 to 15 days, but will vary based on the size of your order and what you ordered. for example, if you were ordering corrugated plastic, auluminum, banners or bumper stickers, you will see the following options on the last page of your checkout with the cost of each based on what you are ordering and date of delivery requested (please note all choices are in business days). next day air - 1-2 days delivery rush 4-6 days priority 7-9 days standard 10-12 days saver 15 days what is the cost of signs? you can check pricing using the online pricing calculator. price breaks are only available for signs that are exactly the same. for more frequently asked questions, click here. call
