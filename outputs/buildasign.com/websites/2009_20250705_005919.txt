"i just received my banners and they exceeded my expectations. i will be using you again for more banners. it's so easy to design and upload on your website and to see the results in person was very impressive. the 4-color processing is amazing. with your great work, we know we will attract the attention we need for our new business!" -- ward b. "this site was the easiest to use and had all the features you could want, also i was able to import artwork ... wow... and the price was less than most other websites with shipping." --bill d. within the past month i have placed two orders with "buildasign.com" for a marathon being held on the outer banks of north carolina. one of those orders was cumbersome and had approximately 80 different signs which had to be manufactured. i commend your company for its professionalism and quick work as every one of the signs arrived quickly and exactly as they were designed. thanks for the excellent work and i will definitely recommend you to others who need similar services completed. -- chris m. "recently we purchased 10 "welcome home" signs from your company. i have to tell you we were all so happy with the way they turned out. we were like a group of little kids waiting to open a christmas present when the ups driver delivered the package. it was an extremely fast delivery, and the signs were way beyond what we had hoped! our soldier has just finished his tour of duty in iraq, and is on his way home. we are so very proud of him, and this yard sign will help us tell him how much he was missed and appreciated. thank you for a wonderful product and we look forward to doing business with you again." -- ellen and joe b. "oh my gosh! not only was the ordering process user friendly and fun but the product itself is absolutely outstanding. i will definitely be promoting your business to all of my friends. watch for orders coming from the austin texas area, they will be coming in shortly! thank you so much, i'm really glad i found your website!" -- peggy l. "just got the sign - it looks absolutely great! we are totally pleased. your service and the quality of the sign (banner) have been top notch - and in both cases better than we could obtain locally. thank you very much!" -- lynne and fred b. i just received my first sign in the mail. it is absolutely perfect. less than 3 days after i uploaded my custom artwork, a perfect metal sign was delivered to my door. i couldn't be happier. kiss my skepticism away - i'm ready to order 10 more custom signs for unique holiday gifts for friends and family. wonderful service and quality. thanks -- gretchen h. "i wanted to let you know that your company is awesome! this is my second order with your company and it has been another great experience! your website is great for designing signs. i have referred your company to many people. i'm sure i will be back again to place another order. you are true to your word concerning the quality and ease of designing and ordering. keep up the good work!" -- laurie l. "i just received the sign i ordered. it is perfect - exactly as i had envisioned it prior to building it on your site, and exactly as it appeared at the "proof" stage. i could not be more impressed that you can do such a terrific job and do so for such a small order - 1 sign!! - and for such a great price through a user friendly site. i apologize for gushing but i really couldn't be more pleased with the whole process and its result. i certainly know where to go for any future sign needs. great site and service people. thank you." -- bill s. copyright © 2010 buildasign.com™ all rights reserved help - contact us - f.a.q. - sitemap - pricing account - myaccount products - signs - banners - magnetics - all products company - overview - press room - careers - testimonials programs - affiliate - business solutions - areas of service legal - privacy policy - terms of service - shipping policy - terms of sale
