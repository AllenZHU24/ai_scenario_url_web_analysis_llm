determine whether or not the failed product is covered by our guarantee. customizing your sign what kind of image should i use for a photograph?try using a photograph of the best quality you have available. if using an image from your camera, take the picture at the highest setting the camera provides. if scanning a picture, set your scanning software to scan at 300dpi. your file must be less than 20mb in size and one of the following file types: eps, jpg, tif, bmp, gif, png. we are happy to assist you in uploading larger files or different file types. please call our customer service department at 1-800-330-9622.what kind of image should i use for a logo or clipart?to use a logo, or some type image created by a graphics professional from solid lines and colors (specifically called 'vector art'), using an eps file is the best choice. by using an eps file in your design, you can retain the sharp lines in your original image, even if the file size you use is very small. if you do not have access to an eps file, then gif or png file formats will provide you with the next best print quality. again, try to find the highest quality image with a file size less than 12 megabytes (12 mb).where can i get a high quality image for my sign?check with your internal graphic design department to see if one has already been created. or, you can purchase your custom original logo and sign designs for a very competitive price through our sign design service program. these designs are created specifically for you by our own graphic design artists. take a look at our services here and/or call our fantastic customer support team at 1-800-330-9622 or email them at service@buildasign.com to find out more about how we can help you design anything you need for your signs!how can i tell if my image is good?one way to see the quality of your image is to open it in a image viewer (if you don't have one of these, you can use the buildasign.com™ design tool). zoom in on the image, or enlarge it a great deal, and see if the image is very grainy. this is a good indication of a poor quality image. in general, it is good practice to find the highest quality image you can.does buildasign.com™ offer imaging or graphic design services?yes! our sign design services cover almost all of your sign printing needs. from sign and logo design to touchups and image cropping, we can help you get your signs and banners looking great. contact our customer service department for more information.how do you decide the 'recommended size' for my image, and the 'viewable distance'?these calculations are based on the resolution (dots per inch, or dpi) of the image you provide. uploading a higher resolution image means a larger image will look better at a closer distance. more technically, our system first examines the dpi of the image you upload. then, based on that dpi, some mathematical formulas and our own experience, it inserts the image into your sign at the maximum size that will likely give you a clean, high-quality image when viewed at a distance of several feet. the system must assume that the image you provide 'looks good' to start with, as the only factor used when calculating the recommended physical size is the actual resolution (dpi) of the image you provide. image quality what if my image was created using design software, such as for a logo?a vector based eps file is the best option. if the image was created by a graphic designer, they may be able to provide you with that. if a vector file is not available, other files, such as jpegs, can work well, but need to have been originally created at a high resolution. if you don't have access to a high resolution file, our graphic designers can recreate your image as a vector file and provide you with that for future printing. contact us for a quote.what if my image is a photograph?most digital cameras can produce a file that will work well for printing. if the image has been downloaded from a website, cropped or altered, that will often decrease the quality. if you can send the original camera file, it is likely to be of sufficient resolution, and we'd be happy to crop it for you if requested.what if i'm attempting to find images on the internet?many images online are low resolution and are not intended for printing. however, one way to filter for higher quality images is by going to the image section within the google search engine. you would search for the item, and then click on "show options" and then on the left hand side choose "large" or "medium." we do offer a wide variety of clip art in our design tool as well. if you're unable to locate an appropriate image, we do offer assistance with sourcing stock images. contact us for a quote. always confirm that you have permission to use any images included in your design. placing an order how do i know that you received my order, and how do i obtain a receipt?once you have submitted your order, an order confirmation containing your final order total, link to shipment status, billing, design proof, contact and shipment information will be emailed to you.what if i didn't receive my order confirmation?if you haven't received your order confirmation email, please check your junk email folder or spam filter.may i make a correction to my order after it has been submitted?since most orders are transmitted to our production staff immediately upon submission, it is generally impossible to make corrections or changes to the design submitted for printing. if you have just placed your order, and want to check if changing it is possible, please contact customer service immediately via 1-800-330-9622.what is your cancellation policy?you can find our cancellation policy in our terms of sale. shipment/delivery what is your turnaround time?you can receive your order as soon as tomorrow, but any orders placed after 3 pm (cst) will count as an order for the next day. when you're checking out you can pick when to receive your order, but the delivery options will vary based on the quantity of your order and what you order.is there any way to put a rush on my order?when you are placing your order you can decide to receive it in as soon as tomorrow.how will my oversized corrugated plastic signs ship?we do make modifications to some products in order to reduce cost to our customers. for instance, our 4'x4', 4'x6', and 4'x8' corrugated plastic signs cannot be shipped at ground shipping rates; they must ship freight which is a far more expensive for smaller orders than ground. to enable orders with quantity 9 or less large corrugated plastic signs to ship at ground shipping rates, we must slit the back of the boards in one or two places so that they fold to a shippable size. once delivered, the signs can be easily unfolded to their original width. note: orders with quantity 10 or more will ship flat and use freight shipping at cost to the customer.how do i track my order?you may check the status of your order by clicking on the link in your order confirmation email.my product contains a defect or is damaged, what can be done?if the product is damaged and / or contains manufacturing defects when you receive your order, please contact customer support via 1-800-330-9622, or send an inquiry via our support page billing and account information may i use a credit card with someone else's name?for security purposes, the billing address entered on the site must match the address on file for the credit or debit card used.what types of payment do you accept?we accept visa, mastercard and amex.what is your refund policy?for our refund policy, please see our terms of sale.do you offer any discounts?first-time customers will receive 10% off their first order for completing a survey.
