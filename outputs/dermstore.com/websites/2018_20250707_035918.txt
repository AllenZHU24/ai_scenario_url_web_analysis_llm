i've tried many monthly beauty subscription boxes over the years because i love to let my subscribers know if these boxes are worth it. i was so excited to see most of the products were either full size or very deluxe travel sized. they were all brands i recognized and already loved or brands that i had been dying to try!” –lisa j makeup on youtube “my area of expertise definitely does not reside in the beauty aisle, so this box was exactly the right thing for me! i was expecting a mini box of samples, but this thing was packed with full and travel sized items, and i couldn’t wait to try all them out.” –luckydayblog.com “i haven’t been this surprised and excited about a box … normally i prefer boxes to have mostly makeup, but these skincare items sound interesting and could really help improve my skin.” –chicagobeautyreport.com “i love getting my dermstore beautyfix box because of the variety and quality of the products included. the products are either full sized or generous deluxe sizes. the box has encouraged me to try brands i haven’t yet branched out to.” –melanie of youtube's @mrkongsmom “the value of all beautyfix boxes are 4-5 times the cost of what we pay for and i am grateful for the wonderful curation and amazing customer service. for skin and hair care – beautyfix is my go to box.” –mysubscriptionaddiction.com “i subscribe to several beauty box types but this is my favorite subscription. i receive at least one and often two full sized products in addition to many deluxe sized samples. they are almost always appropriate for my skin care needs. occasionally, i give one or two to my 40 year old daughter.” –beautyfix customer this month's box see previous boxes december november october september august july june may april march february january december november october september august july june may april march february daily anti-aging moisturizer spf 30 by mdsolarsciences · don't despair, repair!
