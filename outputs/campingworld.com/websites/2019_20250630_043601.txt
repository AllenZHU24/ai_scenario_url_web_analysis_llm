resolve your concerns informally within 30 days after our receipt of your notice, you may file a claim in small claims court so long as you proceed only on an individual basis or commence an

class member or in any representative capacity or proceeding. further, you agree that no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. you agree that the award of the arbitrator will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction in the state of illinois. you agree that we may seek interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in illinois, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. you must file a demand for arbitration with the aaa within one (1) year after the date your claim arose, or within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. otherwise, your claim is waived.
