rental costs vary depending on the size of the rv you choose and the length of time you rent it. other costs include options like convenience packages, trip interruption protection, generator use, additional miles, etc. local and state taxes also apply. will i be shown how to drive and operate the rv? when you pick up your rental rv, you will receive an orientation tour to familiarize you with all the rv's systems and operation. you will have a chance to ask questions of a knowledgeable representative so you can be assured of being comfortable and familiar with driving and operating the rv. can i bring my pet in the rv? yes. traveling with all your family members, including your well-behaved pet, is one of the great advantages of an rv vacation. a pet deposit will apply to cover any damages or necessary cleaning when you return the rv. what comes with the rv and what will i need to bring? you will need bed linens and blankets, pillows, towels, cookware, cooking utensils, tableware and eating utensils. you may bring your own or rent a convenience package containing these items when you rent your rv. you will also need any outdoor gear you expect to use, such as chairs, table, grill, lantern, canopy and bikes; maps and directories; clothing and toiletries and food. items such as rv linens and towels, cookware, tableware, maps and directories can all be purchased at any camping world supercenter or at campingworld.com. can i park my car at the rental center? check with the rental center where you will be picking up your rental rv for long-term parking availability. the rental center cannot assume any liability for your vehicle while it is parked on-site. do i need a special license to drive an rv? no special license is required to drive an rv in the u.s. you must hold a valid driver's license and be at least 21 years of age to drive any rental rv under rental center regulations. do i need special insurance and where can i get it? if you plan to drive the rv into mexico, you will need mexican auto insurance. you can receive information on how to purchase this insurance in your rental information package. can i drive the rv into mexico or canada? yes, though certain restrictions may apply as outlined in your rental information package. see the question above regarding mexican auto insurance requirements if you plan to drive into mexico. what kind of gas mileage will the rv get? rv gas mileage varies depending on engine size, driving habits, city or highway driving, flat or mountainous terrain and how much weight the rv is carrying. generally fuel efficiency ranges from 6-8 miles per gallon. how often will i have to fill the gas tank? fuel tank capacity varies according to the size of the rv and the chassis on which it is built. see the fuel capacity of each of our rental rvs at our rvs . you can estimate how often you will need to fill up by dividing miles per gallon into the number of gallons the fuel tank holds. it is neccessary to use 89 octane or higher unleaded gasonline. how often will i have to empty the holding tanks? this depends on how many people will be using the sinks, shower or tub and toilet. conserving water use in the rv reduces the need to empty black water and grey water holding tanks frequently. what kind of facilities will i find in campgrounds? campground amenities vary from primitive with no electric, water or sewer hookups and only compost-type toilet facilities to resort-like facilities with 30 and 50 amp electric, water, sewer, cable and telephone hookups, wi-fi access, on-site clubhouses, pools, hot tubs, restaurants, organized group activities, children's programs and more. a comprehensive campground directory, such as the woodall's or trailer life directory, will help you choose parks and campgrounds with the amenities you want. how many miles can i expect to travel in a day? the beauty of rv travel is that you can decide when, where and how far you go. remember that a more leisurely pace will leave you less fatigued at the end of the day. you can route your trip with short drives between the attractions you want to see and stopovers you plan to make, or you can elect to drive longer distances each day to reach a desired destination. if your family or group includes two or more drivers, sharing driving duties helps to keep one driver from becoming overly tired. even though your rental rv is larger than your passenger car, truck or suv, all are equipped with comfortable seats, automatic transmission, dashboard instruments that are easy to read, controls that are easy to operate and other amenities that make driving the rv a pleasure instead of a chore. like many other rv drivers, you may actually find that driving your rental rv is relaxing and enjoyable. do i need to make reservations at campgrounds ahead of time? during peak seasons at certain locations such as theme parks, beaches and national parks, reservations can ensure that you have a site with the amenities you prefer when you reach your destination. before departing on your trip, call parks and campgrounds where you plan to stay to check on site availability and whether or not you should reserve a site for the time you plan on staying there. find phone numbers for parks and campgrounds in your campground directory. can i park in retail store parking lots overnight? while many rv owners elect to overnight in retail store parking lots (with management's permission), security is best in public or private campgrounds and rv parks. camping world rv rental recommends staying in supervised rv parks and campgrounds. can i park in highway rest stops overnight? laws and regulations vary from state to state on time limits for parking at interstate rest areas or other highway rest stops. observe and obey all posted regulations and check with any on-site personnel on rules and limitations. again, security is best in public or private campgrounds and rv parks. highway rest areas are intended for and best utilized as a quick stop-over for meal times, using restrooms and getting a little exercise between driving stints. please contact us with any more questions you may have. signup for email deals find out about new products, special offers and a whole lot more! signup ordering how to order return policy shipping policy contact us printable order form about our prices president's club member benefits join the president's club renew your membership rv view magazine members only giveaway our services rv & auto insurance roadside assistance extended warranties hard to find parts about us our story affiliate program job opportunities goodwill ambassadors become a vendor copyright ©2009 camping world, inc. all rights reserved. site map | site terms | privacy policy browse by product category outdoor store rv screens & shades rv steps, ladders & mats outdoor rv chairs & tables outdoor grills & accessories rv bikes, boats & accessories camping gear rv patio decorations rv awnings & accessories racing & tailgating gear pet supplies rv maintenance rv covers & garages rv freshwater systems rv propane rv fans & rv vents rv heaters & furnaces rv sanitation & sewer rv electrical & solar rv storage & maintenance rv generators rv air conditioners cleaners bed & bath rv lighting rv kitchen rv directories & rv books rv travel comforts rv toilets & accessories rv appliances rv bedding rv laundry & rv bath rv games rv furniture rv windows & floors tow center of america rv mirrors & backup rv jacks & leveling rv tires & rv wheels rv shocks & rv stabilizers truck accessories hitching & towing rv performance rv electronics tv, dvd, & home theatre rv satellites & receivers radios & portable audio gps & rv navigation cb's & handheld radios rv thermometers & weather browse by rv brands keystone dutchmen jayco fleetwood fourwinds forest river damon heartland winnebago coachmen itasca crossroads monaco starcraft pace american airstream american coach komfort weekend warrior holiday rambler r-vision carriage double tree little guy sunnybrook freedom hauler k-z viking four winds adventure mfg
