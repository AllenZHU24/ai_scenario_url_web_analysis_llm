worked hard to become the nation's largest rv and outdoor retailer and attribute our success to remaining true to our core values, which focus on ethical conduct, supporting our local community, and constantly improving. we expect that our associates and business partners share these core values and understand that our local community extends to those who work hard each day to create products that end up in our homes and on our roads. while this expectation informs how we do business, the state of california asks that we tell you a little more about how camping world and camping world rv sales work with the companies that bring us the products we offer to you: first and foremost, it is camping world's policy not to purchase any products made or acquired in any way through the use of forced labor or human trafficking. our direct importer commits to following this policy and performs routine audits of factories where our products are made and takes prompt action to maintain compliance with local laws. similarly, camping world's vendors commit to us that the products we purchase comply with all applicable laws. because of this expectation, camping world and camping world rv sales do not currently verify, internally or through a third party, their respective product supply chains to evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and forced labor. neither camping world nor camping world rv sales independently audit suppliers to evaluate compliance with our expectation that the supply chains are free from human trafficking and forced labor. neither camping world nor camping world rv sales require suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the final products comply with local anti-trafficking and forced labor laws. while camping world and camping world rv sales expect our associates to share our core values, we do not maintain separate internal accountability standards and procedures for associates or contractors who fail to meet our standards regarding human trafficking and forced labor. finally, neither camping world nor camping world rv sales provide associates or management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on human trafficking and forced labor. price match policy we want to make sure you’re getting the best products at the best value. our online prices will be honored in our retail stores. in the event you find a lower price online for an identical in-stock item, let a retail associate know, and we will price match it. this applies to purchases made within the last 30 days online and purchases made within the last 14 days at our retail locations. to receive a price match: contact our customer service team (1-866-450-4739) or visit your local store. provide us with the
