(click pic below for details) meet the team! pat: renaissance man (or cave man) depending on who you talk to, pat spent most of his life working in the leather and furniture making trades while living in mystic, ct. he graduated from worcester polytechnic institute with an engineering degree and put it to good use (oozing sarcasm) when he moved to florida in the early 80's to be a carpenter (hippie). he established himself as a successful business owner specializing in custom high-end woodworking during the "excessive 80's". while surfing al gore's internet in the early 90's a fluorescent (energy efficient) light bulb lit up and pat turned his attention to computers and the world-wide-web. joe: joe is the designated driver of cabinetparts.com, he knows the direction, distance and difficulties along the way. joe's beliefs in japanese business practices are strong but are sometimes confused with practices popular in feudal japan. several of us were chased by a sword wielding joe last week when we came back late from lunch. kathy: kathy has taken up the enormous task of operations manager which loosely translates to organizer of executions, purveyor of sustenance and mom. her love of brown recluse spiders is only rivaled by her love for a good peanut butter sandwich and an al jarreau lp. her past experience working for ibm (you know, the computer company?) and dedication to making success fun is a fantastic asset to the cabinetparts.com family. polly: polly joined cabinetparts.com on a deal with the government when they mistakenly thought we were a half-way house. polly brings with her an extensive knowledge of the cabinet business and the ability to beat up any unruly members of our team. our growing product line is only one of the many contributions polly has made to the cabinetparts.com team. maria: from peru , "charo" as she is known around here is our south american connection. maria grew up in the cabinet manufacturing business and her knowledge masks her insanity. her work ethic is driven by devotion or by a massive nervous tick, either way she's a valuable member of our cabinetparts.com team. andrew: while andrew is often mistaken for a disney ride with legs he is actually the sultry voice many of you will hear over the phone when placing your orders. andrew's contributions to the cabinetparts.com team have proved invaluable with his skills with part matching and finding exactly what our customers need. robert: robert landed at cabinetparts.com when he ran out of money trying snowboard around the world. now he spends his days assisting our customers while looking over his shoulder to make sure polly isnt hexing him for taking up space in her cubicle. richard: richard is our web guru and has the ability to work magic with scripts, it is almost "matrix" like. while continuing to monitor, maintain, and expand our web site richard still finds time to work on his plans of world domination which we curb with regular feedings of "starbucks" caffeinated products. mat: mat has the huge task of keeping our network running smoothly and making all the images on the website shine. we abuse the right that he knows it all, but he calmly answers all questions, and designs all graphics with the highest quality. he also enriches our lives with new music day after day. phil: phil came to florida from brooklyn (gee, another new york transplant…what a surprise) and is in charge of our day to day warehouse operations. with his skills in carpentry and electricity, we are aiming to launch our new line-up of electric chairs…yes, those kinds of electric chairs. we are also convinced that phil was a zen buddhist in another life since his ability to keep calm on crazy days is super human. jamie : jamie took refuge at cabinetparts after working as a dental assistant due to a lack of interest in her proposal that ranch dressing could be used as mouth rinse. daily she entertains us with by singing 80’s pop hits over the intercom, her version of a-ha’s “take on me” is smokin’! here at cabinetparts, jamie is responsible for keeping our prices super competitive and assisting with product information while robbing her co-workers blind on texas hold-em night. david : david’s knowledge of furniture construction (nude foot model) is an invaluable asset (nude foot model) to the cabinetparts sales team.

(did we mention he used to be a nude foot model?) charlie : charlie, our labrador retriever, was born about the time cabinetparts.com began. some of us feel that charlie is the real driving force behind the company but other's see charlie's purpose in life is to eat and sleep when he is not sniffing out balls to play fetch with. charlie tells us that he will respond to all e-mail sent to him. (if he doesn't turn the computer mouse into a chew toy in the process) lenny : rescued from the streets when pat realized that he was a dog and not a large yellow horse, lenny has take his post as self-appointed "guard dog". trained to bark and growl at the walk-in customers, his commitment is visible since he has started doing the same to the ups, fedex and mailman. he looks up to his adopted older brother "charlie" and has learned how to sneak food when people aren't looking. jay: jay was frozen in carbonite and shipped to savannah , georgia where he spends his days crocheting and baking pecan pies. his heart will always be at cabinetparts.com and has made plans to throw himself off his house everyday to simulate the beatings he took while working here.  i love y'all! wayne : while wayne no longer works for cabinetparts.com, he was here so long his ghost roams our warehouse. not that he's dead or anything, he was here a really long time a really really long time .seriously. year of 1998year of 2004year of 2006year of 2009 home | all cabinet hardware & cabinet making materials | customer service | view cartcopyright © 1997 - 2009 cabinetparts.com, inc. all rights reserved telephone: 800-857-8721 - 1301 w copans rd. ste g-6, pompano beach, fl 33064 need help?ask our professionals...your question hereload time: 6 milliseconds. size: 37719 search - go back: cabinet hardware and accessories cabinetparts.com home
