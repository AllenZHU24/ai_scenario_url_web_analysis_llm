you believe... pat spent his early years in the leather and furniture making trades in mystic, ct. a worcester polytechnic institute grad, he immediately put his engineering degree to good use (oozing sarcasm) in florida in the early 80's becoming a carpenter (hippie). he established a successful business specializing in custom, high-end woodworking during the "excessive 80's." while surfing al gore's internet in the early 90's, a fluorescent (energy efficient) illumination drew pat’s attention to the world-wide-web. knowledge of cabinet-making, european hardware and the dot.com boom formed his concept to “help save the world!” luckily for us, cabinetparts.com was a success and pat’s had a steady job ever since. joe: joe is the designated business driver of cabinetparts.com because he knows the direction, distance and the difficulties along the way. joe believes strongly in japanese business philosophies and tenets such as kaizen. but sometimes these concepts are confused with practices popular in feudal japan. several of us were chased by a sword wielding joe last week when we came back late from lunch. richard: richard is our web guru because he has the ability to work magic with scripts. it is almost "matrix-like!” while continuing to monitor, maintain and expand our web site presence, richard still finds time to work on his plans of world domination which we curb with regular feedings of "starbucks" caffeinated products. charlie: charlie, our labrador retriever, was born about the time cabinetparts.com began. some of us feel that charlie was the real driving force behind the company but other's see charlie's purpose in life was to eat and sleep when he was not sniffing out balls to play fetch with. unfortunately charlie passed away in 2010 so he no longer romps the offices and warehouse of cabinetparts.com. view the article below to see how important he was to us. charlie the dog we were saddened to announce the passing on march 1, 2010 of cabinetparts.com oldest and most loved employee charlie, our yellow lab, after a long and wonderful life. charlie who was named for the charley in john steinbeck’s “travels with charley” has been part of the team since cabinetparts began in the back room of a warehouse 12 years ago. he even spent one summer on a 5000 mile road trip, but alas with no published book to his credits. charlie, born on feb 14 1996, became a daily fixture at cabinetparts since its beginnings in 1997. in the early days he was the glue that kept us positive and moving forward with his boundless energy, enthusiasm and playfulness. at times when we weren’t even certain of our own survival as a business, it would be charlie who would bring us a stick or ball to remind us what was really important. and after 15 minutes we would get over the hump. those were special times for all of us. he certainly brought joy to each employee that ever worked here. fortunately, no one has been allergic to dogs. his daily routine for years was to start in the warehouse tearing up boxes and as the day progressed, would pay each and every one of us a visit for only reasons he would understand. maybe a certain back scratch or the possibility of some forbidden food. we never were sure, but at some point in every day, we would find him under a desk somewhere, or at least sitting and staring with the message that he would do this for as long as it would take to get what he wanted. i would not see him for the entire day but by mid-afternoon, he would always be under my desk taking a nap until an inner alarm would signal it was time for us to go home. in the early days, the ups, fedex and usps drivers would bring biscuits and it would not be unusual to see him climb up inside the ups or mail truck trying to commandeer it. christmas brought all sorts of treats and his birthday was celebrated each year with a cake and party (see photos) by us all. of course, his birthday was valentine’s day, which made it even more special! the sun-sentinel, local newspaper for south florida, even included charlie in an article about dogs in the work place. so thanks everyone for being a good friend and a huge thank you goes out to dr. lisa feinstein, and her team at the plantation animal hospital, for their patience, compassion and understanding during charlie’s last few days and our craziness. we still miss you old friend and may you rest in peace, pat and teeny ways to shop cabinet hinges drawer slides knobs and pulls kitchen storage all product categories other links hinge replacement customer service why
