descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others.additionally, the ai scans all of the website's images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an alt (alternate text) tag. it will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an ocr (optical character recognition) technology. to turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the alt+1 keyboard combination. screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn adjustments on as soon as they enter the website.keyboard navigation optimization: the ai adjusts the website’s html, and adds various behaviors using javascript code to make the website fully operable by a keyboard. this includes the ability to navigate the entire site using the tab and shift+tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with esc, trigger buttons and links using the enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the spacebar or enter key.  additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus (available at any time by clicking alt+1). the ai will also handle triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it. browser and assistive technology compatibility:we support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible so visitors can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. our system supports all the major systems including google chrome, mozilla firefox, apple safari, opera, microsoft edge and i.e 11 or above, jaws and nvda (screen readers), both for windows and for mac users.our website may be operable on other platforms though we are not officially supporting them and recommend users to utilize the aforementioned systems.comments, and feedback:despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, it is possible that there will still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible.the nature of web development means we will be constantly improving the accessibility interface, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. all this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, at all times, and in accordance with technological advancements.if you’ve discovered a malfunction or find any aspect of the interface difficult to use, or if you have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. simply click on the “feedback” button at the bottom of the interface and fill out the feedback form or email us directly. ways to shop cabinet hinges drawer slides knobs and pulls kitchen storage all product categories other links hinge replacement customer service why cabinetparts.com? affiliate program cabinet-shop network stay connected - follow us pinterest twitter youtube facebook © copyright 1997 - 2024 cabinetparts.com - all rights reserved. use of this site is subject to certain terms of use. for screen reader problems with this website, please call 1-954-428-3800 privacy policy   |   terms of use   |   do not sell my personal information    |   accessibility statement
