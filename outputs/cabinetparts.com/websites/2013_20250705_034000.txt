(mdf)plywood with one "a" facestep 1: laminatingmake sure the laminate and the surface you are covering are clean, dry and smooth.on the laminate sheet, mark dimensions 1/2" larger than the size of the surface to be covered (substrate) to allow for trimming after bonding.place a strip of masking tape over the cut line to prevent chipping.mark the line on the tape, and cut through tape and laminate at the same time using laminate shears, table saw, or if you use a circular saw, cut from the bottom side of the laminate to help eliminate chipping of the decorative surface or use a router and straight edge with the laminate clamped tight to prevent movement.use the remaining material to cut strips for the edges in the same manner as stated above.step 2: laminating the edgesusing a 1" disposable paintbrush, apply adhesive to the backside of the laminate edge strips and double-coat the edge of the substrate (see drawing b).(cabinetparts.com also offers spray adhesive and rollers.)note: do not apply adhesive to top surface at this time.allow adhesive to dry. adhesive is dry when contact can be made with the adhesive and transfer is not made to your hand.*to test the adhesive for appropriate dry time, lightly touch the adhesive with your finger. if the adhesive feels tacky yet does not stick to your finger, it is ready to bond. refer to adhesive manufacturer directions.*important! once the adhesive is ready to bond, if any contact is made between the backside of the laminate and the edge of the substrate, they will bond immediately.be very careful to align each laminate piece with overhang to the substrate edge prior to the surfaces touching.starting at one end of the edge, start applying the edge.use a hard rubber j-roller to apply uniform pressure along the entire strip (see drawing c).wilsonart has also added a full line of bevel edge for laminate countertops.laminate countertops do not have to look old-fashioned, especially with the new designs and textures in today’s market. complete the look of your countertop with a decorative bevel edge.a custom beveled edge from wilsonart gives your countertop the sculpted look of more expensive materials like stone, but at a fraction of the cost. it's a beautiful look on a modest budget.in addition to our standard offerings shown, we can customize bevel edges in any current wilsonart color. please contact us at 800-857-8721 for pricing and availabilty on this special order program.step 3: removing excess laminateusing the laminate trimmer/router, trim off the excess laminate protruding above the substrate surface (see drawing d). areas that cannot be routed may be filed smooth. when filing, never drag a file out toward the decorative surface of the laminate. doing so can result in chipping of the color/pattern.step 4: laminating the countertopspread the adhesive on the substrate using your adhesive roller. (see drawing e). two thin coats on the surface are better than one heavy coat. one hundred percent adhesive coverage is required (each coat). before applying a second coat, make sure that the first coat is dry. allow adhesive on both components to dry*.*to test the adhesive for appropriate dry time, lightly touch the adhesive with your finger. if the adhesive feels tacky yet does not stick to your finger, it is ready to bond. refer to adhesive manufacturer directions. adhesive can also be sprayed on, if the right equipment is available, or “painted” on with a disposable paint brush also.position the dowel rods on the top surface approximately 6"-8" apart, perpendicular to the front edge (see drawing f). position the laminate carefully over the substrate. starting at one end of the counter, start removing the dowels one at a time while holding the laminate in place. use a hard rubber 3" j-roller or t-roller to apply uniform pressure across the entire countertop. apply pressure to every inch of the surface for a complete and lasting bond.step 5: removing the excess laminate rout the laminate overhangs with the router and flush trim bit. the radius left by the routing process in any inside corner should remain. a radius on an inside corner (minimum 1/8") will strengthen the corner. use a file to remove sharp edges and sharp outside corners.clean off excess adhesive with adhesive cleaner and a clean white cloth (acetone is also an option).step 6: finishingonce you have installed your new laminate countertops, or perhaps have chips in your existing laminate countertops and wonder how you can fill the seams or repair those chips, check out seamfil laminate repair. seamfil allows you to repair nicks and fill seams with an easy one-part system. seamfil mechanically bonds to the substrate of the laminate and dries hard, becoming a permanent part of the laminate surface. seamfil resists moisture, detergents and other household products as effectively as the original laminate. you can custom-match seamfil to your laminate using the color charts below.nevamar laminate seamfil color match chartwilsonart laminate seamfil color match

installation easier and the final results more professional. we have an array of laminate install tools and adhesives for laminate and bevel edge installation to help you install and professionally finish your laminate countertops.how we package and ship laminate for countertops1. each sheet is carefully rolled to prevent creases or damages to corners. multiple sheets are rolled inside of each other.2. sheet(s) are then strapped or taped to prevent them from unrolling during transit.3. sheet(s) are then carefully placed in ups approved shipping cartons.4. cartons are then sealed, labeled, and shipped directly to you save time and money and avoiding multiple handling of your product.laminates purchased from cabinetparts.com are shipped directly to you through ups. they are carefully rolled, banded, and placed in ship-tested boxes that have been approved by ups. shipping direct actually eliminates the normal multiple handling of your laminate. this will save you time and money, and actually increases the chance that your laminate will arrive safely in good condition.ups/fedex have a formula for these boxes that measures the length, width, and height of the box, and then calculates a weight based on those dimensions. this is called dimensional weight or dim weight. often the dim weight is much higher than the actual weight. laminates are always shipped in an oversized box and therefore classified as a dim weight shipment. multiple sheet shipping costs may remain the same, as the box size is the same and the actual weight does not exceed the dim weight.we strive to keep both product costs and shipping costs as low as possible and continually check rates to ensure that you get the best economic value. tips when choosing lighting category: tips | lighting | share:
