in search... suggested site content and search history menu search... about us acme tools was founded by george kuhlman in 1948 as a small electric motor repair shop in downtown grand forks, north dakota. the business was named "acme" because it represented the highest level or degree attainable, the peak of perfection. the core values back then were simple; offer the highest quality products at competitive prices, backed by superior professional service and support attainable. now, over 65 years later, it's hard to believe that this small town motor repair business has grown to become a major tools and equipment supplier. today acme tools continues to be one of the premier retailers of tools and equipment with some of the largest first–class showrooms in the nation. with ten locations in north dakota, minnesota and iowa, acme tools has served the contractor, woodworker and do–it–yourselfer with a wide selection of tools and equipment from all the major manufacturers. our
