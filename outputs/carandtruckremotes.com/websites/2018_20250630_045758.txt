a: yes, you can. most programming instructions do not require any special skills or tools, just the remote and your ignition key. q: are all cars with power door locks factory equipped with keyless entry system? a: because the vehicle is factory equipped with power door locks does not mean it has a keyless entry system . please consult with your dealers parts department or contact us to find out. q: why do you have to program a remote? a: you have to program the remote you purchase so that the keyless entry module recognizes the signal emitted by the remote. in other words the system has to know the signal sent by the remote (transponder, rke) so that it can work on your vehicle q: how many remotes can i program to my vehicle? a: in most cases rke systems allow at up to 4 transmitters (remotes). please contact your local dealer with your vin numbers for detail. for example hyundai systems allow only 2 remotes to be programmed to one car q: i called my dealer and they told me that my remote can only be programmed using their computers/tools and it will cost me a lot. can i program my remote without paying an arm and leg for it? a: in some cases you can program it yourself without using any tools or any special service skills. usually you will need only the remote, your ignition key and your vehicle. we offer free programming instructions with those remotes (where applicable). remotes for some late model and prox, smart keys to those vehicles have to be programmed by a dealer or a local pro automotive locksmith using diagnostic equipment. q: i have a problem. i purchased a remote on ebay for my car. i followed the instructions but i cannot get it to work. can you tell me what could be the problem? a: if your car responds to programming instructions but the remote does not respond, it is most likely one of the following reasons 1. the battery may be dead. 2. try the instructions again - sometimes it takes more then one try 3. if it still does not work, the remote might be broken or you have a wrong remote. if your car does not respond to programming 1. it may not be equipped with keyless entry system - please check with your local dealer 2. there might be a problem with your rke module � please check with your local dealer 3. you may have the wrong set of programming instructions � please check with your local dealer q: how many remotes can i program to my vehicle?
