entry remotes?articles: remotes and transponder chip keys explained.most people have experience with small remote controls on their car's key ring, which allows for a quick and convenient entry into their car. such common remotes serve to unlock car doors, open trunks, and even provide panic alarms in which the vehicles horn will sound repeatedly in the event of an emergency situation, or even to help a driver find their own car in a crowded parking lot. such remote controls, by technical term, are called fob cases. fob cases, as with any kind of tool or device, are subject to common wear and tear over time. an individual may find that their remote stops operating as expected, or the case containing the technological insides of the device has become damaged. people should be aware that they might not necessarily have to replace their particular device in the event that anything regarding its operation changes. someone may drop his or her remote and find that it's protective covering has become cracked, or otherwise broken. as opposed to buying an all-new case, it is possible to purchase, for far less cost, a replacement fob cover. what is of value is the computer chip/machine operating inside case, not the case itself. sometimes fob cases cease to work as they are expected to. a common reason for this is because the computer chips/machines that are inside of the unit's casing, as with most machines, are powered and energized by an outside source, i.e. fueled. the remote operates on battery power, and instead of seeking to purchase an all-new unit (which would indeed prove costly) an individual may simply pry the case apart and replace the battery as needed. doing so will save any savvy consumer quite a bit of money over time, as it is generally far better to maintain what one already has, instead of buying into a societal norm of disposable consumerism. it is very simple to maintain a fob case remote control, even in the event that a person's case is missing some of the buttons. it is just as easy to replace the buttons themselves, rendering it unnecessary to purchase a whole new functional unit. also, car systems are generally programmed to specific remote controls, so that one remote operates on one car, but not any other cars. in this way, the devices are specific and tailored to particular individual vehicles. the cost of seeking to purchase an all-new case will, of course, include the cost of having your car reprogrammed. it is also pleasant to note that these cases can be customized, and individualized with great ease, making them distinctive and easy to recognize. however, if someone does try to maintain and repair their fob case and they find that it still will not work, a replacement may be necessary and unavoidable. in this instance, if they have purchased additional parts in attempts to fix a fob case, they might want to put aside those additional replacement parts for use in the future. keyless entry remote or
