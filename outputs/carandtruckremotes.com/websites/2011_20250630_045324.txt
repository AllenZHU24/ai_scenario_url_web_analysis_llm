remote button that is usually attached to your key chain or key ring. it also allows you to open the trunk or turn on the interior lights to help enter or exit from your car at night. a remote keyless system (sometimes called keyfob fob or key fob) can include a standard remote keyless entry system (also known as rke systems) and a remote keyless ignition system (rki, which is standard on many chevy, gmc, buick, caddy and pontiac cars). some later model cars offer so called smart, or proximity system that is triggered when the key fob (remote, keyfob, transmitter, advanced key, remote control, door opener) is within a certain distance of the car. the smart remote control system is not cheap, therefore is usually only installed on high end model cars or "loaded" versions of vehicles. those systems are also sometimes called hands-free, which well describes how those work. if the vehicle is equipped with advanced key system, a vehicle can be unlocked without the driver needing to push a button on the key fob remote to lock or unlock the car. using proximity remote systems also offer so called start push button, which allows the driver to start ignition, engine without having to insert the key and turning the ignition. customers from canada will save even more money purchasing remotes from us. vehicles in us and canada use the same keyless remotes and the

without fumbling for the key is an important safety feature, especially in poorly-lit areas. with most keyless remotes, pushing the remote button once unlocks the driver side door only and, sometimes, pushing the button twice will unlock the other doors, so there's no worry about a hidden intruder or thief jumping into the passenger's side. most keyless entry remotes have a panic button that honks the horn and flashes the lights. this is also a very import safety feature. most vehicles that are broken into are ones with unlocked doors. many thieves will walk up and down rows of cars trying the doors to see if it has been left unlocked. if you were a car thief or a burglar you would probably do the same. why break into a car if you can find one with the doors already unlocked. locks are designed to keep unwanted intruders from gaining entry to the engine, the passenger compartment, and the trunk of the car as well as to prevent the thief from driving away with the car completely. to prevent theft many manufacturers use specially cut keys that cannot be duplicated very easily. and the locks for most of these cars are extremely difficult to pick. the keyless entry system provides a convenient way to lock all your doors but to also arm the security system with a push of one remote key fob button. car owners that have these types of systems are more likely to lock their doors than people without them. if you do not have a vehicle with a keyless remote entry system installed you can add a complete system with a remote key fob to your vehicle. if your car already has power door lock it will be a lot easier and faster to install this feature. we sell batteries!! if your keyless remote is only working once in a while, it may be time to change the battery. a sign that your
