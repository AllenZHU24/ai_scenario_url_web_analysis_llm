sell the same as the ones at my local dealership? a: yes we sell only original factory/manufacturer keyless entry remotes. we sell brand new remotes (top of the page) and b-stock (used) remotes (bottom part of the page) just like those from your local dealer but for less, usually you save about 75% or up to $120 q: do i have to program a new remote? a: yes, in fact you will have to reprogram

remote myself? a: yes, you can. most programming instructions do not require any special skills or tools, just the remote and your ignition key. q: are all cars with power door locks factory equipped

transmitters (remotes). please contact your local dealer with your vin numbers for detail. for example hyundai systems allow only 2 remotes to be programmed to one car q: i called my dealer and they told me that my remote can only be programmed using their computers/tools and it will cost me a lot. can i program my remote without paying an arm and leg for it? a: in some cases you can program it yourself without using any tools or any special service skills. usually you will need only the remote, your ignition key and your vehicle. we offer free programming instructions with those remotes (where applicable). garage door opener faq q: how do i pair my garage door key fob? q: do i have to reprogram my garage door remote after changing its battery? q: how do i know which garage door opener remote i need? q: do universal remotes work on all garage doors? q: what are the two types of garage door openers? q: how do i pair my garage door key fob? a: when it comes to how to program your garage door opener to work with a remote, the process usually involves the following steps. on the garage door opener itself, you'll find a button labeled "learn." hold this button down until it starts flashing, and then push a button on your garage door remote control. the lightbulb on your garage door opener should flash, signifying that your remote is now paired. q: do i have to reprogram my garage door remote after changing its battery? a: unfortunately, not all garage door openers will remember paring with a remote after that garage door remote control's battery has died. you may need to pair the remote again, but you should check your instruction manual to verify this. q: how do i know which garage door opener remote i need? a: while universal garage remotes exist, many types of garage door openers will only work with the same brand of remote. you can check which remote control matches with your garage door opener by checking the manufacturer and model information on the opener's motor or instruction manual. q: do universal remotes work on all garage doors? a: while a universal garage remote is designed to work on most garage door openers, a single remote will not work on all openers. this may be due to the age of the opener or simply an incompatibility issue. before purchasing a universal garage remote, check that your garage door opener is listed in the compatible model section. q: what are the two types of garage door openers? a: the two types of garage door openers most commonly used are belt drives and chain drives. belt drives are strong and quiet, making them good for homes that have attached garages. chain drives can be used to open particularly heavy garage doors, but they do tend to be louder to operate. there are also screw drives, which use a trolley on a threaded steel rod, and jackshaft drives, which use a 24-volt dc motor to turn a torsion bar. key fob battery faq q: how do you know if your key fob battery is dying? q: how long does a key fob battery last? q: what kind of battery does a key fob take? q: can a low battery in a key fob cause your car to not start? q: how do i check my key fob battery? q: how do you know if your key fob battery is dying? a: if your key fob battery is low, there are a couple warning signs: you'll need to click buttons several times for them to function, and/or the key fob signal won't reach as far as it once did. unfortunately, there is no indicator on the fob to tell you that the battery is low - you'll need to keep a car key battery replacement on hand in the event that it dies. q: how long does a key fob battery last? a: typically, a car key fob battery will last for three to four years. if you've been using your current key fob battery for several years, it's a good idea to replace the battery - or to have a replacement battery on hand in the event that it dies. q: what kind of battery does a key fob take? a: key fobs generally use 3-volt button cell batteries - typically a cr2032 battery. many of these batteries are universal for all key fobs, but you should always check to make sure your key fob uses this battery before ordering a replacement. q: can a low battery in a key fob cause your car to not start? a: if the battery in your car key fob dies, your vehicle will not be able to detect it. if your battery is low, you may have trouble starting your car, and it make take several tries to activate it using the built-in buttons. this is one indicator that the battery is low - though it's best to have a replacement on hand before you reach this stage. q: how do i check my key fob battery? a: if you're wondering how to tell if your key fob battery is low, a battery testing kit can tell you if your car key fob battery is low on power. otherwise, there is no traditional way to check if your key battery is low - aside from keeping an eye out for the signs noted above. customer service wholesale discount locksmith search program
