i was really impressed; still i was doubtful you could help me find a replacement for a much beloved wine glass that i broke three years ago. on a whim, i typed in the name of my dinnerware, and much to my surprise and delight, there was my impossible-to-find wine glass. you had two; i bought them both. and just a couple of weeks ago, i pulled out my mother's silver which she began collecting it in 1949 well before she married. much to my delight, i found her lovely royal rose pattern on replacements. i intend to complete the set. thank you so much!" b.g., athens, al12/8/13"first time to shop with you but if pleased once i receive my purchase, i will be shopping again. easy website to navigate." s.v., venice, fl12/8/13"every piece i have ordered has been wonderful!" p.b., apple valley, ca12/8/13"love your site!" j.g., greensboro, nc12/8/13"you guys are great!" m.i., greensboro, nc12/8/13"i love replacements!" c.m., anchorage, ak12/7/13"excellent service" j.a., okatie, sc12/7/13"love your store and what you do!" k.m., grandview, wa12/7/13"have always been pleased with your service. thank you." c.s., columbia, sc12/7/13"i enjoy working with you very much. it is always a pleasure!" b.e., three springs, pa12/7/13"love the company. you guys had dishes that no one else had." k.h., fremont, ca12/7/13"you're a great resource, thank you!" s.m., springfield, la12/6/13"great website. glad that i found you." more pages of letters from our customers!
