because we offer more than 450,000 different patterns with inventory that changes daily, we've found that sending pattern-specific listings to our customers better meets their needs. for this reason, we do not publish a catalog of all inventory we have on hand. if you would like to receive free inventory availability/pricing lists via email or u.s. mail, sign in or create a new “my account” to add patterns to your list of favorites. can you help me identify my pattern(s)? yes. if you don't know the name of your pattern, click here for pattern identification instructions or fill out our pattern identification request form and we'll do the research for you for free. do you have a gift registry? we've partnered with myregistry.com to provide a unique option for your gift registry. from house-warming gift registries and birthday wish lists to traditional wedding gift registries, we are a great one-stop shopping choice for both discontinued and current tableware & accessories.  create your gift registry for an easy way to share your "love to have" replacements items with friends and family. where do you get your inventory? we work with more than 500 suppliers around the country who are constantly scouring estate sales, auctions, antique stores, and anywhere else they're able to find the pieces you need. a portion of our inventory comes to us directly from major brands, and we also purchase select items from anyone interested in selling to us. do you carry active patterns in your inventory? yes. we purchase inventory from all major tableware manufacturers and carry an extensive selection of active patterns at prices that offer substantial savings. we also are continuously adding more active patterns to our selection. pieces are covered by our 30-day, no-questions-asked return policy. i received your list of available pieces but didn't see what i'm looking for. how do i request specific pieces? our “find this for me” service is designed to inform you via email when requested out-of-stock pieces in your pattern become available. if you participate, we'll let you know when your pieces are in stock before we notify others on file for the pattern. learn more about how “find this for me” works. what's the best way to care for my china, crystal, and flatware? we always recommend hand washing your china, crystal, and flatware. find more information and helpful tips about caring for your dinnerware here. can i sell items to you? yes, we buy items from thousands of individuals each year. visit our "sell to us" page for detailed information about selling to us – we've created step-by-step instructions as well as helpful tips for an easy selling process. you can also call us at 800-replace or (800) 737-5223 and we'll let you know if we are currently buying pieces or sets in your pattern(s). do you repair damaged pieces of china, crystal, or silver? in the case of silver, click here to review our silver restoration services and prices or for crystal repair, download our repair or restoration request form. we currently do not offer repair service for china, but are working to offer these services in the near future. do you sell my name and phone number? we do not sell or rent your information to any third party. review our privacy policy. can i specify that i would like only "never used" china? since we inspect and grade each piece for quality before it's inventoried, we do not separate pieces based on new or previously owned status. rest assured that any piece you purchase from us is fully guaranteed and comes with our 30-day, no-questions-asked return policy. you list discounts for some pieces due to "slight," "noticeable," or "considerable imperfections." what does this mean? most of our inventory is in excellent condition, but sometimes we find pieces that don't live up to our rigorous standards. although we don’t sell anything that's chipped or cracked, these pieces may show some signs of wear, so we feel it's only fair we lower their prices accordingly. our classification system used to describe imperfections is as follows: slight imperfections (25%) - pieces may show signs of slight wear or use. noticeable imperfections (50%) - pieces will show visible use or wear, including surface scratches, minor trim wear, and color wear. considerable imperfections (75%) - pieces will show substantial use or wear, including surface scratches, minor trim wear, and color wear. we take a pattern's age and rarity into consideration during our inspection process, which means: if a pattern is really old and really rare, we won't grade it as harshly as we would a newer pattern that's easier to find. what are your shipping & handling rates? for all product types shipped within the u.s., the shipping and handling charge varies according to the dollar value of the order. review our current u.s. shipping rates. do you ship outside the united states? yes. our shipping and handling charges for international orders do not include taxes, duties, or brokerage fees. these taxes and fees are the sole responsibility of the recipient. see current international shipping & handling rates. have other questions?
