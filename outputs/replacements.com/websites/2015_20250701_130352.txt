thank you for your services!!" b.a., ontario, canada11/16/15"years ago, i was so disappointed to find out that the dishes i had been collecting were not being manufactured any longer. so for years, i was stuck with pieces of china that i could not add to. then by luck, i found your website, and i have been adding to mine, as well as my daughters. about 10 years ago, my husband and i were in florida, and i asked him, if we could travel home via north carolina, and we found your warehouse, so i could add a few more pieces. we were totally shocked by how beautiful your store was, and how massive ! you had everything there, we never thought we would ever see again. thank you for the prompt shipping over the years, it was lovely to do business with your company. once i called and had the nicest lady on the telephone as well..... great company you have." e.l., marlton, nj11/16/15"replacements.com helped me tremendously! my daughter broke a special appetizer dish to our set 2 years ago and i found it on their site. it came in a timely manner, wrapped and protected very well. i recently needed to replace chipped china pieces to a different set and ordered them also and was so impressed that they even still had this other set that we bought in 1991! i would have had to buy a whole new set since the chips were getting embarrassing. it saved me thousands of dollars to just replace the chipped ones instead. you can see that this company goes above and beyond to make sure it is completely protected during shipping. the prices are fair, and they are very nice people to deal with. thank you repacements.com!!" p.b., jasper, tx11/11/15"your company provides an amazing service with great prices. i love the identification service you provide. i purchase items in garage sales, and resale shops and this service gives me a way to find out more about the treasures i love. thank you so much for the wonderful, caring people you employ!!!
