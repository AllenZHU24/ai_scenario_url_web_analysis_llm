we know...but not unusual. the diamond industry is one large marketplace online and there are many people looking at the same diamonds across different sites.if this does happen, here is what happens next: you will receive an email within 48 hours if the diamond is not available. we try to get you an answer sooner, but there is a delay because many of our diamond vendors are internationally based, creating a time difference.  we go out of our way to bring comparable diamonds to the table, honor your original price if possible or try to come really close!don't worry - you will not be charged until you accept a replacement and your diamond is ready to ship from our facility to you. once an order is complete on our website, we authorize your credit card - similar to a hotel reservation. it is not an actual charge, just a hold. if you decide you do not want any replacement diamonds, we contact your bank and remove the hold. the authorization is not a charge, just a hold. we know that getting ready to propose and going through the process of finding the right diamond and ring can be daunting, especially when you are doing it all online.at ritani, we try really hard to alleviate any concerns you may have. we have gemologists and specialists to help you along the way. do not hesitate to reach out. that is what we are here for! we're passionate about what we do and we love, love! our goal is to help you get the moment right, even if there are a few hiccups along the way. remember - it's the pressure that makes the diamond!yours truly, ritani staff xo3 barker avenuewhite plains, ny 106011.888.9ritani (1.888.974.8264)the engagement ring company that’ll do anything for love.diamond inventoryfinancing & split payments ritani differencecontact usour services shipping and returnsfree in-store previewabout ritaniterms and conditionsritani reviewsprivacy policyfrequently asked questionscalifornia privacy policydiamond buy-back programsms terms of serviceprotect your rings with buffrget diamonds in new yorkbuy now, pay later with klarnacopyright © ritani 2021
