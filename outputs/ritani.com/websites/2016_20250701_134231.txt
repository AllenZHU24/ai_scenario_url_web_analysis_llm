the clarity grade is based on any tiny natural identifiers found within a diamond. most ritani diamonds are free from inclusions that are visible without magnification. we recommend these diamonds for the best balance of quality and price. the shape of a diamond can affect the importance of its clarity grade. while the brilliance facets patterns of round and princess-cut diamond can hide certain imperfections, step-cut shapes – such as emerald and asscher-cuts – have large, open tables. if you are searching for a step-cut diamond, we suggest looking at those with clarity grades of vs2 or higher. see which diamond clarity grades are the most popular learn about diamond inclusions fl flawless. no imperfections on the surface, or inclusions within. these are the most rare of all clarity grades, and therefore extremely valuable. see diamonds that are flawless if internally flawless. no inclusions within the diamond, but may have very minor blemishes on the surface. if so, they will not be visible without magnification. see diamonds that are internally flawless vvs1 very very slightly included 1. likely to have minute inclusions that can only be seen under 10x magnification by an expert eye. these inclusions can only be seen through viewing the bottom of the diamond. see diamonds that are vvs1 vvs2 very very slightly included 2. likely to have minute inclusions that can only be seen by experts under 10x magnification. these may be visible when viewing from the top of the diamond. see diamonds that are vvs2 vs1 vs1 very slightly included 1. the untrained eye may detect inclusions within diamonds of this grade, under 10x magnification. it can take a long time to see them, however (over 10 seconds). see diamonds that are vs1 vs2 very slightly included 2. slightly more inclusions than diamonds with vs1 grade, 10x magnification is still needed to detect any flaws. it can take up to 10 seconds to see them. see diamonds that are vs2 si1 slightly included 1. more noticeable inclusions that experts can see clearly with 10x magnification. they may or may not be visible to the naked eye, depending on where they are in the diamond. see diamonds that are si1 si2 slightly included 2. may have noticeable inclusions that are easy to see under 10x magnification. sometimes, the unaided eye can detect them. see diamonds that are si2 i1 included 1. obvious imperfections under 10x magnification. the durability of the diamond may also be compromised depending on the specific inclusions. i2 included 2. obvious imperfections under 10x magnification. there may also be eye visible inclusions, both within the diamond and on the surface. the durability of these diamonds may be compromised. i3 included 3. large and obvious imperfections that can be clearly seen with the unaided eye. these may be within the diamond and at the surface level. the durability of these diamonds is likely compromised. representative diamond under high magnification magnification 10x fl if vvs1 vvs2 vs1 vs2 si1 si2 i1 i2 i3 flawless internallyflawless very very slightlyincluded very slightlyincluded slightly included included ritani does not offer diamonds below an si2 clarity grade. the history of diamond grading while natural diamonds have always been found to have inclusions and blemishes, a standardized method of assessing their clarity was not established until 1953. gemologists at the gia created a clarity grading scale that has since been revised twice. in the 1970s, two new grades were added: internally flawless (if) and included 3 (i3). the latter of these grades was a response to a growing number of low clarity diamonds within the market. originally, the 'i' of these lower grades represented 'imperfect'. 'included' was considered to be more specific in nature. average diamond clarity grades the most popular diamond clarity grades with ritani customers are vvs2 to vs2. these grades typically offer a great balance of value, as any imperfections – either on the surface or within the diamond’s structure – cannot be seen without magnification. many of our customers also opt for slightly included grades. these are good options for those wanting to prioritize another of the 4cs – whether that is color, carat weight, or cut. fl 1% if 8% vvs1 12% vvs2 17% vs1 19% si1 12% si2 10% how clarity affects different shapes as the most popular shape, round brilliants are able to hide more inclusions than other diamond cuts. this is due to their brilliant facet pattern, which reflects light from lots of different angles as the diamond is viewed from the top. other shapes with brilliance facet patterns include the princess, oval, marquise, and pear. with step-cut shapes, such as the emerald and asscher, however, a higher clarity grade may be desirable. this is because these diamonds are shaped with larger tables – allowing you to see further down into the diamond. this potentially allows for inclusions and blemishes to be more visible, both under magnification and to the naked eye. choosing your clarity grade when it comes to choosing a clarity grade for your engagement ring, it is best to keep in mind both the diamond shape and ring style that you want. a halo setting, for example, may limit the visibility of inclusions that are located closer to the diamond’s girdle. prongs on a solitaire ring can also be positioned over more noticeable imperfections. if you are concerned about the inclusions in your diamond, talk to a ritani customer service representative. they can guide your choice and ensure that your diamond is set in the best possible way. as previously noted, some diamond shapes typically demand a higher clarity grade than others. if you adore brilliant facet patterns such as the popular round, princess or cushion cuts, you may not need to invest as much in a clarity grade than those looking at asscher or emerald-cuts. learn more about diamonds cut discover how cut is the greatest indicator of a diamond's sparkle. color explore the range of colors naturally found within diamonds. carat weight see how carat weight can impact the appearance of your diamond. written by paul meiterman, gemologist at ritani paul meiterman g.g., a.j.p., c.g.
