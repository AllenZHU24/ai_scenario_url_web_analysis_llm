carat diamondsfind affordable ringsdiamonds under $1000diamonds under $2000diamonds under $5000frequently asked questionsis the diamond i am interested in (or have already bought) guaranteed to be mine?many of the diamonds on our site are a part of our exclusive inventory. however, some of the diamonds listed are from third-party vendors who sell their diamonds on our site as well as other sites. because of this, you may purchase a diamond on our site and later receive an email that the diamond is no longer available. you will be notified within 48 hours if the diamond is no longer available. this slight delay is because many of our diamond vendors are internationally based, creating a time difference.  when a diamond is no longer available, we will work with you to find a similar diamond. you will not be charged for anything until the order ships.can you engrave a diamond?​​engravings can be added to the girdle of the diamond using lasers. please note that engraving a diamond will make it final sale. if you are interested in engraving your diamond, please contact our customer service team.​​i’m interested in learning more about a diamond through a virtual

the rarest diamond color?​ red diamonds are the rarest diamond color. there have been less than 30 red diamonds ever found! ​which diamond cuts sparkle the most?​round-cut diamonds sparkle the most. choose an ideal cut grade to get maximum sparkle! ​how many carats should an engagement ring be?​​an engagement ring’s carat weight really depends on your budget and your future spouse’s tastes and expectations. believe it or not, not everybody wants a rock! in the united states, the average engagement ring is about one carat. ​how much are real diamonds worth?​​real diamonds range greatly in price. their cost really depends on many factors, such as the quality of the stone and the shape of the stone. ​​what is a 1 carat diamond worth?​​the worth of a 1-carat diamond depends on lots of factors, such as its cut grade, clarity grade, and color grade. a 1-carat diamond can cost anywhere between $1,000 to $12,000 or more. ​​why are diamonds so expensive?​​diamonds are the hardest gemstones, and they are in high demand, which makes them more expensive. additionally, mining and cutting diamonds to become beautiful sparkling stones adds to their cost. the size and quality of a diamond can also make it more expensive.​​how much is a 2 carat moissanite?​​a moissanite stone that is the equivalent of a 2-carat round-cut diamond can cost between $900-$1,400 depending on its color grade.​is a 1 carat diamond big?​​a 1-carat diamond will be noticeable on the finger. the average engagement ring in the u.s. is about 1 carat. if you want to make your 1-carat diamond appear even bigger, choose a halo setting, which surrounds the stone with tiny diamonds. note that the diamond shape you choose can make your diamond appear larger - for example, a 1-carat marquise cut, oval-cut, or pear-cut diamond will appear larger than a 1-carat round-cut diamond since these stones have a larger surface area.​​3 barker avenuewhite plains, ny 106011.888.9ritani (1.888.974.8264)the
