the cut grade indicates how much a diamond will sparkle. cut refers to how perfectly the symmetry and proportions of the diamond capture light and then deliver it to the eye in the form of sparkle. if the diamond does not have exceptional proportions, or if the symmetry is off, the light will not travel through the diamond and return to the eye with maximum sparkle. if you choose a diamond with a cut grade of reserve ideal or ideal, you'll notice that it has more sparkle than diamonds with lower cut grades. if you're looking for a larger diamond within your budget, consider selecting a diamond with a very good cut grade, which will deliver amazing sparkle at a more affordable price. and if you want to maximize the size of your diamond, any ritani diamond with a cut grade of good will still sparkle beautifully. how cut grade can affect diamonds of the same price cut grades:reserve ideal, ideal,very good, good cut grade:poor smaller diamond more sparkle perfect polish visibly larger diamond slightly less sparkle very good polish what is color? this grade refers to the "whiteness" of a diamond, or its lack of color. color is the characteristic of a diamond that is most easily detectable by the eye. look at any ritani diamond, from d to j (colorless to near-colorless) and you wont notice any distracting color, just beautiful sparkle. k and l graded diamonds are considered faint yellow. this means that, while still white diamonds, they reflect some secondary tones. these diamonds therefore look their most brilliant when set in yellow gold, which has a muting effect on the diamond’s faint yellow. for an exceptionally white and colorless diamond, to be set in a white metal, consider those in grades d to f. alternatively, grades g to j are almost invisible to the untrained eye. colorless d e f near-colorless g h i j faint yellow k l ritani does not carry diamonds of this quality noticeable color m n o p q r very noticeable color s t u v w x y z what is clarity? the clarity grade is based on any tiny natural identifiers found within a diamond. diamonds are graded for clarity based on the finish on the outside of the diamond, and the appearance of any natural internal organic identifiers produced by nature. look closely inside any ritani diamond, chosen for its exceptional clarity, and you won't notice anything other than its beautiful sparkle. diamonds are one of nature's wonders, and a diamond with one of the highest clarity grades — like if or fl — is even more incredible to see. if you are considering the balance of clarity to the other three cs, consider that we've hand-selected diamonds that have no inclusions that are distinguishable without magnification, even in the diamonds with the lowest clarity grade we offer. this ensures that even if you choose a diamond with si-clarity, you will be amazed by the sparkle, not distracted by visible inclusions. if you want to find a diamond with the most exceptional sparkle, look for a diamond that's earned one of the highest grades clarity, like the ones you'll find here at ritani. select a clarity grade fl if vvs1 vvs2 gemologist's tip fl - flawless. no imperfections.extremely rare. if - internally flawless.very rare. vvs1 - very, very slightly included 1. vvs2 - very, very slightly included 2. vs1 - very slightly included 1. vs2 - very slightly included 2. si1 - slightly included 1. si2 - slightly included 2. vs1 vs2 si1 si2 what is carat weight? this is a measure of a diamond's weight and a reflection of its size. carat weight is exactly that — a weight measurement. but carat weight does not always clearly help you determine if one diamond looks larger than the next. consider that the carat weight of a diamond is the total weight, no matter how that weight is distributed. if a diamond is poorly cut and is tall and narrow, when viewed from the top that diamond will appear smaller than a diamond of equal weight. to eliminate this concern when shopping at ritani, we do not offer any diamonds cut to maximize carat weight at the expense of sparkle. .25 ct. .50 ct. .75 ct. 1 ct. 1.25 ct. 1.50 ct. 2 ct. 3 ct. 4 ct. 5 ct. gemologist's tip for the best value in carat weight, instead of choosing .50 carats, 1.0 carats, or 1.5 carats, etc., choose diamonds that weigh slightly less. you'll notice a significant price savings. take the next step get an expert opinion from our virtual gemologist ritani experts are available to answer your questions and deepen your understanding of diamond quality. call 1.888.202.0804 or start an online chat. diamond trends not sure where to start?
