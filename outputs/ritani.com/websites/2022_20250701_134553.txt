carat round cut diamondscarat weight1 carat diamonds are very popular for engagement rings, diamond earrings, or diamond pendants. they provide a good balance between size and price.round diamondsround cut diamonds (also called brilliant-cut diamonds) are revered for their classic shape and incredible sparkle. cut with 58 facets — or 57, if there is no culet — the round shape was designed to produce as much sparkle as possible. as sparkle is what many people are looking for when they buy a diamond, round cuts are immensely popular.60% of the diamonds in our inventory are round-shaped, making it easy for you to find the right one for your needs. not only are round cut diamonds the most sparkly, but they are also the most popular diamond shape. however, because they are the most sparkly and the most popular, this makes them the most expensive diamond shape.round cut diamonds are perfect for custom jewelry, such as earrings and pendants. to make your round cut diamond appear even larger, choose a halo setting. or let your round cut diamond stand out on its own in a solitaire setting.earth grown diamondsearth grown diamonds are mined from deep under the earth's surface where they have lain dormant for millions of years. when you hold an earth grown diamond, reflect on the immense journey this diamond has taken and the history it has endured.a diamond starts out in the lowly form of graphite, such as you might find in the tip of your pencil. over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the immense pressure and temperature produced deep inside the earth rearrange the carbon atoms into a crystal structure.then miners dig deep tunnels under the earth and collect the rough diamonds. the rough diamond looks nothing like the sparkly diamond you are holding. it has an irregular shape, is very dirty and looks dull. the diamond is then cleaned, cut into it's desired shape, and finally polished into the beautiful diamond you are now holding!all ritani earth grown diamonds are certified by either the ags or gia – the two most respected independent grading labs in the world.if you need help selecting your 1 carat round cut diamond, reach out
