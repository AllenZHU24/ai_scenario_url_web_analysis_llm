ringsrelated articlesengagement ring buying guidehow to buy a diamond: the ultimate guidefrequently asked questionshow much should i spend for an engagement ring?you may have heard the rule that you should spend two to three months of your income on your engagement ring, but this rule was just a marketing ploy created by de beers. your engagement ring spend should be based on your budget and the type of ring you are looking to buy.what should i know before buying an engagement ring? budget: how much you are willing to spend on a ring?ring style: are you looking for a classic ring, a modern ring or maybe a vintage ring?metal: rings can be made of platinum or different types of gold.shape: the shape of the center diamond in your engagement ring affects the overall look.4 cs: the color, clarity, cut and size of the stone are important criteria in choosing your diamond. what is the average cost of an engagement ring?for natural diamonds, the average cost is around $6,000 and the average carat weight is 1.25 carats. for lab-grown diamonds, the average cost is $4,000 and the average carat weight is 2.5 carats.what metals are used for engagement rings? engagement rings can be made out of platinum or gold. gold can be mixed with various metals to produce different colors such as white gold or rose gold. gold rings also come in different purities. for example, 18 karat gold is 75% gold and 14 karat gold is about 58% gold. what types of engagement rings are available in the ritani collection? the ritani engagement rings collection includes a variety of styles such as solitaire, halo, three-stone, vintage-inspired, and more. you can choose from different metals, diamond shapes, and settings to find the perfect ring. can i customize my engagement ring? yes, you can customize your engagement ring at ritani. you can select the type of metal, diamond shape, setting style, and other details to create a unique ring that reflects your personal style. how do i choose the right engagement ring? to choose the right engagement ring, consider your partner's style, the 4 cs (cut, color, clarity, and carat weight), and your budget. our website offers detailed guides and filters to help you find the perfect ring. what is the difference between solitaire and halo engagement rings? a solitaire engagement ring features a single diamond as the focal point, while a halo engagement ring has a central diamond surrounded by a circle of smaller diamonds, creating a "halo" effect. both styles have their own unique appeal. are ritani engagement rings ethically sourced? yes, ritani is committed to ethical sourcing. all of our diamonds are conflict-free and comply with the kimberley process, ensuring that they are sourced responsibly and ethically. do you offer lab-grown diamond engagement rings? yes, we offer lab-grown diamond engagement rings. lab-grown diamonds have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as natural diamonds and are often more affordable and environmentally friendly. how do i determine the ring size? to determine the ring size, you can use our online ring size guide or visit a local jeweler for an accurate measurement. it's important to get the correct size to ensure a comfortable fit. what is the return policy for engagement rings? our return policy for engagement rings allows you to return the ring within 30 days for a

in-person preview program that allows you to see an engagement ring before purchasing it. you can select a ring online and have it sent to a participating jeweler near you for an in-person viewing. how do i choose the perfect engagement ring?start by considering the preferences and lifestyle of your partner. understand the 4cs (cut, color, clarity, carat) for diamonds or learn about other gemstones if considering alternatives. think about the metal type for the band, the setting style, and any personal touches that could make the ring special. it's also helpful to set a budget before beginning your search.what are the most popular styles for engagement rings?popular styles include solitaire, halo, three-stone, and vintage-inspired designs. solitaire rings feature a single stone, halo rings have a central stone surrounded by smaller diamonds, three-stone rings symbolize the past, present, and future, and vintage-inspired rings reflect historical eras with intricate details.what is the difference between a lab-grown and a natural diamond?lab-grown diamonds are created in controlled environments using advanced technological processes that replicate the conditions under which diamonds naturally develop. they have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds but are often more affordable and environmentally sustainable. natural diamonds are formed over billions of years below the earth's surface.what is the significance of the engagement ring's setting?the setting not only affects the ring's appearance but also its wearability and the security of the gemstone. popular settings include prongs, bezels, and pavé. the right setting can enhance the stone's beauty and ensure its longevity.how can i ensure the diamond in the engagement ring is ethically sourced?look for diamonds certified by reputable organizations like the gia, which track diamonds from mine to market. consider purchasing from jewelers who adhere to the kimberley process or offer conflict-free and ethically sourced diamonds.are there sustainable options for engagement rings?yes, sustainable options include recycled metals, ethically sourced or lab-grown gemstones, and vintage or antique rings. these choices can minimize environmental impact and ensure ethical practices.how do i choose between a prong and a bezel setting?a prong setting uses metal claws to hold the gemstone, allowing more light to enter and enhancing its brilliance. it's ideal for maximizing a diamond's sparkle. a bezel setting encircles the gemstone with metal, offering better protection and a modern look. choose based on the desired balance between sparkle and durability.what should i consider when selecting a diamond's cut?the cut of a diamond significantly impacts its brilliance and fire. look for cuts with good to excellent ratings to ensure the diamond reflects light beautifully. consider your partner's style preferences as well; while round cuts are classic, princess, cushion, or other shapes may align more closely with their taste.what is the significance of the ring's metal choice?the metal choice affects the ring's overall appearance, durability, and maintenance requirements. gold (yellow, white, or rose) is traditional and requires periodic polishing. platinum is durable and hypoallergenic but more expensive. silver is affordable but tarnishes over time. consider your partner's lifestyle and preferences when choosing.what is the most popular cut of engagement ring?round diamonds are the most popular shape for engagement rings. this timeless diamond shape offers the most sparkle and flatters any finger.the clarity you deserve1.888.9ritani (1.888.974.8264)contact usritani differenceour services sign up for exclusive offers
