a ring with a simple prong or bezel setting is known as a solitaire. additional design details can be added to prong or bezel settings to create more intricate rings, such as halo or three stone engagement rings.read on to explore the different types of engagement ring settings. prong setting a prong setting uses small tips of metal to hold the center diamond in place on the engagement ring band. lots of light reaches the diamond, producing beautiful sparkle. prongs raise the diamond above the band for a simple, classic look. 6-prong set engagement ring bezel setting a bezel setting secures the center diamond with a solid circle of precious metal around the diamond’s sides. bezel-set engagement rings are more secure than prong-set rings, and provide a seamless, modern look. a diamond is less likely to be chipped or scratched in a bezel setting since less of it is exposed. bezel settings also minimize the risk of snagging your ring on clothing. because they are so durable, bezel set engagement rings are a popular choice for those who live a very active lifestyle. ritani’s semi-bezel setting provides the security of a bezel, but allows more light to reach the diamond’s sides. this increases sparkle, similar to a prong setting. semi bezel set engagement ring halo setting the halo setting uses either prongs or a bezel to secure the center diamond, which is encircled by another band of diamond-studded precious metal. a bezel-set center stone lends the halo ring a vintage feel, while prongs create a modern look. ritani also offers a stunning double halo setting, which adds yet another circle of diamonds surrounding the center stone. three stone setting the three stone setting uses two smaller diamonds to flank the center diamond. the classic three stone style uses three diamonds of the same shape, but some prefer to mix and match shapes, for example pairing a princess shaped center diamond with round shaped side stones. cathedral setting the cathedral setting is a modification that can be added to most engagement rings, including simple prong-set rings, halo rings and three-stone engagement rings. much like the shape of an actual cathedral building, the band gradually rises upward to secure the center diamond. this not only adds structural stability to the ring, but allows additional light to enter the diamond, creating greater sparkle. regular setting vs cathedral setting in a solitaire engagement ring. surprise diamonds surprise diamonds can be added to any type of engagement ring setting. these small accents create subtle sparkle and are a fantastic way to increase the brilliance and artistry of a ring. designed by master craftsmen, our engagement settings combine timeless elegance with cutting-edge trends. now get started shopping for the engagement ring of her dreams! related articles what is a shared prong setting? what is milgrain? surprise diamonds: faqs as featured in customer service free in-store preview order status free shipping international shipping free returns lifetime warranty diamond price matching company info about ritani in the news contact us the ritani difference ritani jewelers jobs become an affiliate education learn the 4cs of diamonds diamond cuts engagement ring styles engagement ring cuts engagement ring settings engagement ring materials jewelry insurance more to explore refer a friend blog customer reviews engagement stories stay on top of trends thank you!we have received your email address and youwill start to receive exciting updates. financing | sitemap | terms & conditions | privacy policy | sweepstakes © 1999 - 2017 ritani all rights reserved engagement rings loose diamonds men's wedding bands women's wedding rings diamond earrings diamond bracelets free in-store preview: atlanta charlotte chicago dallas jacksonville new york san francisco washington, d.c. see all cities powered by geotrust shipping to | close one moment please… chat now my wish list
