status now < back to top billing questions & inquries we do not charge credit cards upon order and we do not store credit card numbers on file. when you place an order with us, we place an authorization hold for the full amount of the purchase in order to verify availability of funds.  this hold will remain on your card until the order is complete or an appropriate amount of time passes (per your bank's policies). in accordance with visa/mc/discover/amex guidelines, we charge your card as we ship items to you.  with many orders this looks like a traditional transaction. when your order contains preorder items, which are clearly labeled throughout the purchase cycle, you will definitely see a significant amount of time between the initial purchase and the fulfillment.  this may result in the appearance of a double charge. additionally, if your order contains one or more preorder items, you may see more than one charge as we charge your card against the original authorization only as we ship items to you.  at no time should these charges ever exceed the original purchase as detailed here. if, after reading the above, you still believe you have been charged in error please submit a billing inquiry.  a representative will research your case and be in touch to resolve within 5 business days. get billing help now shop now. pay later with klarna. we're excited to announce
