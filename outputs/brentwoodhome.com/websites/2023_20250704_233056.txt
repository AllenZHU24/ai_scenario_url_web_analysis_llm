cancel home / materials we use materials we use we're going green in a big way. we now use certified organic latex, cotton, and wool, as well as natural flax and coconut husk fibers. the majority of our memory foams are made with plant-based biofoam®. and we integrate upcycled denim scraps, recycled plastics, and innovative polyesters made from wood pulp for more sustainable textiles. origin: usamemory foams made with biofoam®at brentwood, we use memory foams formulated with up to 20% biofoam®. biofoam® is a patented biological foam made in the united states from vegetable materials, such as corn, sunflower seeds, castor oil beans, and soybeans. biofoam received a cradle to cradle® certification™, a globally recognized measure of safer, more sustainable products. using biofoam® does not mean that our memory foam is now a natural product. it isn't. however, it does represent an improvement over traditional memory foams. our memory foams infused with purifying activated charcoal are not made with biofoam®. all polyurethane foams are certipur-us® certified. origin: india, guatamalaorganic certified latex from our rubber forestsour natural latex is gols-certified organic (cu861640). it has received the eco-institut® label (1119-34212-001) and fsc® (c156319) certifications. it’s a natural and renewable resource. we source our latex mattress cores from our rubber forests and processing facilities in india and guatemala. they're made by tapping hevea brasilienesis — known as “rubber trees." we collect the white sap in cups, then froth and bake it with steam to create a durable core. at brentwood, we use both dunlop and talalay processed latex. our latex contains more than 95% certified organic raw material based on total weight, with the remaining 5% comprises essential processing agents. origin: indiaorganic wool from the high himalayaswe’re proud to use gots-certified organic (cu861640) wool, sourced from our own farms in the himalayas and cleaned without chemicals in our own facility in central india. ethically sourced, it has received the responsible wool standard from textile exchange®, which addresses the welfare of sheep and the land they graze on. our wool is naturally breathable, wicks and absorbs water, and helps keep you cooler than any synthetic fiber. it’s also a natural and renewable resource. organic wool from the high himalayas origin: usa, canada, india, turkeyorganic cotton is naturally betterabout 95% of the world's cotton relies on synthetic fertilizers, harmful pesticides, and chemical additives that damage ecosystems — and our health. our gots-certified organic (cu861640) and fair trade® certified cotton is produced and certified to higher agricultural standards that restrict the use of toxic chemicals. this is better for farmers and our environment. organic cotton also uses up to 90% less water than conventional cotton. plus, it just feels better — it’s more breathable and has a gentler feel. origin: usatextiles made from recycled plastic bottlesbillions of plastic bottles go into landfills — and our oceans — every year. repreve® is an innovative material that harnesses used plastic bottles to create a recycled polyester performance fabric. it’s durable, soft, and breathable — the material is used for activewear, swimwear, and outerwear. by using repreve®, we produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use less energy and water compared to manufacturing virgin synthetic fibers. we use the fabric in a variety of woven tickings and covers. origin: indiacoconut husk fiber pads mixed with latexcoconut fiber has been used for thousands of years. our coconut fiber is made from the fruit's husk. it's lightly mixed with organic latex, pressed, and then baked to form a durable, yet airy core. due to its resistance to moisture and incredible breathability, mold or mildew will not grow. it is ideally suited as a core layer or pad to support innersprings, or to buffer layers of latex and wool. origin: the netherlandsflax, earth’s most sustainable fiberflax is one of the most sustainable natural fibers in the world. this beautiful, durable fiber — one of the oldest cultivated plants in human history — is derived from a blue flowering annual. it’s a hardy, renewable resource that grows with little water in even the harshest of environments. flax seed fiber is inherently eco-friendly and hardy, requiring sunshine and almost no water to thrive. it literally consumes carbon dioxide. one hectare of flax can absorb more than a 3.7 metric tons of co2 and convert it into oxygen. origin: usaupcycled cotton denim, from scraps to goodwe upcycle denim scraps — the byproduct from the production of new cotton denim jeans — to create a support layer that is natural, breathable, and reduces waste. our recycled denim pad is a high-performance thermoregulating material. so it isn’t stuffy, keeping your mattress airy and cool. it’s also free from volatile organic compounds (vocs), which contribute to indoor air pollution. by upcycling this natural material, we prevent the denim scraps from ending up in the landfill. origin: usanaturally contouring buckwheat hullsmost of our popular yoga cushions are filled with natural buckwheat hulls. buckwheat is a natural material that's actually not a wheat or grain. the hulls are small and sturdy. we use “fluffy” buckwheat, which means our hulls have been steam-cleaned and dusted. they are wonderfully supportive and breathable. when used as a fill, their size and odd shape allows the hulls to move around easily, adjusting to your body and providing support right where it's needed. and of course, they are natural, renewable, and biodegradable. origin: usarecycled steel for durable innerspringsspring coils have been used in mattresses for decades, serving those who are looking for a traditional mattress support system. steel is also sustainable — it's recyclable, the most recycled material in the world. we use recycled steel wire of various gauges in the production of our pocketed innerspring units — essential to our hybrid mattress designs. encasing coils individually and thoughtfully placing them in 5 zones improve this classic sleep experience by providing distinct and precise support. origin: usacooling & purifying charcoal-infused memory foamcharcoal is a natural material full of beneficial properties that are perfect for mattresses and pillows, like temperature and moisture control. it helps keep you dry, cool, and comfortable — all night long. our activated charcoal-infused, high-density memory foam helps facilitate a cooler sleep environment, using open-cell technology and purifying activated charcoal to draw heat and moisture away from the body and prevent hot spots. cooling & purifying charcoal-infused memory foam origin: usa, europesoft, light tencel® made from wood pulptencel® is a soft, versatile fiber made from wood pulp. the manufacturing process is complex: wood is harvested from sustainably managed sources, treated with solvents in a closed-loop system, where it is dissolved, before being dried, extruded, and ultimately spun into yarn and woven into cloth. because it’s plant-based, it’s biodegradable. we use tencel® selectively — as a soft, durable ticking on our oceano mattress. our mission: do better. use more natural, recycled, and innovative materials from the best domestic and international sources. consume less energy, create less waste, and fight climate change. if we all opt for quality over quantity, shop consciously, pursue social justice, and rethink our relationship with our planet, peace and sustainability is possible. brentwood home is owned by avocado green brands. we can help help center + faqs digital gift cards returns
