we make everything to order when you purchase from brentwoodhome.com. the handcrafting process usually takes 3–5 days to complete, and delivery times vary depending on your distance from our los angeles workshops. expect to receive your mattress within 5–10 business days after placing your order. we’ll send confirmation by email with a tracking number. may 2018 update: due to an increase in demand for products that include latex, expect 1-2 weeks plus shipping until you receive your order. 2. what are the dimensions of the box my mattress will ship in? foam & latex mattresses twin/xl: 15”x15”x42” full: 15”x15”x56” queen: 20”x20”x48” king/cal king: 20”x20”x48” spring & hybrid mattresses twin/xl: 15”x15”x42” full: 15”x15”x56” queen: 15”x15”x62” king/cal king: 15”x15”x79” 3. can an entire luxury mattress really fit in that box? yes! mattress technology has changed so much in the past decade. even high-end mattresses can be easily shipped to your home in smaller boxes. 4. how do i take it out of the box? open the box where you’d like your mattress to sit. the mattress will be sealed inside plastic, so you can slide it out easily. inside the box, you’ll also find a little white, plastic safety blade. use that blade to open the plastic. once the mattress is open, it’ll have a little rebound, but it won’t burst open. sit back and watch as it quickly recovers. 5. when can i sleep on it? your mattress might take up to 5 days to recover from being compressed in its box, but you can sleep on it right away with no problem. just give it a few days before you make any decisions. 6. what's my return policy? mattresses & box springs we offer a 120 night sleep guarantee. sleep on your mattress for 30 days to allow your body time to adjust to the new bed. during the remaining 90 nights, if you decide your new mattress isn't the right one for you, then we will send someone to pick it up and give you a 100% full refund. only applies to items purchased directly on brentwoodhome.com with a limit of 2 items per year per household. standard shipping costs will apply after that. all other products if you decide they're not right for you, then you may return your pillows, mattress protectors, and other products within 30 days of placing your order. 7. what if i purchased from a third-party retailer? if you purchased your brentwood home products from a third-party source, returns are a little different and subject to each respective retailer’s return policy, so we cannot honor the 120-night guarantee on purchases from outside vendors. 8. how does in home delivery work? once purchased, a representative will call to arrange a delivery date and confirm an appointment time. for mattresses that require in home delivery, estimated delivery time is about 2-3 weeks from time of purchase. health & materials 1. how is it possible that you don’t use chemical fire retardants? doesn’t every mattress have to use them? fortunately, it’s totally possible to avoid using chemical fire retardants with a hydrated-silica sand. hydrated silica is basically crushed quartz and opal gemstones. we also line our mattresses with new zealand wool, which is another natural fire barrier. 2. how does that work? when exposed to flames, the hydrated silica and the new zealand wool fire barriers naturally char and self-extinguish without the use of chemicals. 3. why don’t other people use this material? well, it’s a little pricier. but because we own our workshops and make all our mattresses ourselves, we save money without a middleman and can afford to put a little extra care into making our mattresses completely nontoxic. 4. what about the gel memory foam? i heard it might be toxic and give off a strong odor? we only use certipur-us-certified nontoxic polyurethane foam, which means low voc emissions. when you open up your brentwood home pillows and mattresses, you won’t get the same “off-gassing” odors you might find from other memory foams. 5. where do you source all your materials? since we handmake everything here in california, we try to source locally when we can. but if we can’t, we look for the next best thing. foams – california fire barrier fabric – california wool – new zealand textiles – illinois & north carolina 6. are the bamboo mattress covers removable/washable/replaceable? the bamboo cover on our mattresses can be removed and spot cleaned, but if that doesn’t do the trick, we sell replacements. definitely beware that washing your bamboo cover isn’t a good idea, because it’s lined with new zealand wool that can easily shrink in a washer or dryer. 7. what’s the difference between gel memory foam and regular memory foam? our gel memory foam is a specially formulated memory foam, designed to breathe better and sleep cooler than traditional memory foam. 8. is the kapok in some of your pillows hypoallergenic? kapok is an all-natural material picked from the seed pods of trees in south america. while it’s possible some people may have an allergy to kapok, most do not, making this a hypoallergenic alternative to latex and a vegan alternative to down. guarantee & warranty 1. what does the 120-night guarantee cover? when you get your new mattress, you’ll want to give your body at least 30 nights to adjust to your new mattress. your body might not be used to such contouring support right away. but if you give it some time, and the mattress just isn’t your style, you can contact us within the first 120 days of your purchase, and we’ll arrange for a pickup of your mattress to be donated to a local charity or shelter, free of charge. please note there is a limit of 2 items per year per household. standard shipping costs will apply after that. 2. what if there’s a defect in my mattress that i didn’t discover until after the 120 nights? we have a 25-year warranty for all the mattresses sold on our website and most of our third-party sites. so if a defect is present that you didn’t discover until after the 120-night guarantee, you can contact us directly for a warranty claim form. if it’s found there is a manufacturer’s defect after that 120 nights, we’ll pick up your old one and send you a new one. customers will be responsible for shipping costs for the replacement mattress. 3. is there a guarantee or warranty for other brentwood home products, besides the mattresses? for all of our non-mattress products, we offer a 30-day return policy with a 1-year warranty to cover any manufacturer defects. tell me more 1. what mattress do you recommend using? everyone at brentwood home has their favorite. our office is right in our showroom, so we can try out the products and remind ourselves why we love what we do. since feeling is so subjective, we’ve tried to simplify the process with a scale of firm to plush to help you better decide what’s right for you. 2. i have arthritis or other physical ailments. what mattress is right for me? those with delicate joints will need to pay attention to both the cushioning on top and the support at the base of the mattress. luxury plush models with eurotops tend to work well in these cases, but so do hybrids and latex. keep in mind that a hybrid will give more support, while the latex gives a little more bounce. 3. i definitely want a brentwood home mattress, but i don’t know what base or bed frame to buy. can you make any suggestions? you can use any boxspring, foundation, adjustable base, slatted base, or platform beds with 5-inches or less between the supports/slats. the base should also provide adequate airflow below the mattress to prevent condensation and mold. 4. i’m looking for a mattress for my rv. does brentwood home do custom sizes? if you’re looking for a mattress suitable for an rv or travelin’ van, take a peek at any of our foam or latex mattresses and give us a call. 5. i accidentally threw out my care instructions when i purchased my dog bed. how do i wash it again? you can unzip and remove the cover from your dog bed, washing it on cold and tumble drying on low. the liner of the orthopedic foam is coated with a waterproofed polyurethane to keep the foam fresh and dry, but you can easily spot clean the liner before placing the cover back on the bed. didn't find an answer to your question?
