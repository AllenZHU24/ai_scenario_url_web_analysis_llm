"we strongly believe our environment, especially our homes, are at the center of our well-being, allowing us to live comfortable, happy lives." however, before we started the brentwood home brand, most of our products were sold by retailers who added hefty markups, often times more than doubling the cost of our products. in 2012, with much thanks to the digital age, we saw an opportunity to bring that california comfort and craftsmanship directly to you. that’s why we started brentwood home. no more overwhelming trips to the store or pushy salespeople. no middlemen. no deceptive retailer markups. this, combined with our handcrafting excellence, allows us to provide you with luxurious goods at affordable, honest prices. we’re glad to share a piece of our home with you. look around, stay awhile, and enjoy a comfortable life with brentwood home. with love from california, in the press lifestyle #brentwoodhome inspiration follow us @brentwoodhome make yourself a better bedroom. continue shopping brentwood home is committed to creating the most comfortable and most natural sleep products as possible to give you your best night's sleep. shop mattresses bedding babies & kids pet beds gift cards customers 1-year sleep trial help center shipping warranty & returns my account newsletter company our story blog contact us affirm financing careers sitemap terms & conditions privacy policy become an ambassador guides customer reviews materials we use mattress-in-a-box non-toxic mattress natural latex mattress copyright © 2018 brentwood home. all rights reserved. processing... error added to cart successfully. added to wishlist successfully. × fall sale receive $175 off select mattresses with code: la175 learn more shop mattresses oceano mattress new! crystal cove mattress cedar mattress ojai mattress cypress bamboo gel compare our mattresses bedding pillows wedge pillows crystal cove yoga collection quilts candles mattress toppers babies & kids crib & kids mattresses nursing pillow lounger changing pad toddler pillow kids pillows pet beds griffith runyon learn about us 1-year sleep trial help center reviews materials we use mattress-in-a-box natural latex mattress non-toxic mattresses press blog contact sale sale view full product details → quantity unavailable sold out
