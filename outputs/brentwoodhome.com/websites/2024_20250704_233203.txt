available to you, it’s more important than ever to do your research. keep in mind that not everyone sleeps the same, and different bodies have different needs when it comes to the amount of support they require from a mattress. but everyone should be looking for a mattress made with natural and healthy materials that are lab-tested and proven to be safe for your health and home. problembabies & toddlers are most at risk of toxins & emissionsthe science is clear: physicians, health professionals, public safety officials, and environmental advocacy groups have linked toxic chemicals to the health of our children. research suggests the toxic chemicals found in household products and in our environment are directly linked to childhood disorders and may trigger disabilities such as autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia. that's why the investment in a natural crib mattress is critical. babies and toddlers spend 10 to 14 hours a day sleeping and playing on their crib mattress, potentially breathing the leaching and off-gassing toxic chemicals in their bed. solutionopt for a lab-tested crib and toddler mattressremove the toxins. get chemical flame retardants, spray-on adhesives, and other questionable chemicals out of your crib mattress. it's not hard to do. choose a crib mattress that marries real-world performance (breathability for safety and easy cleaning) with natural, recycled, and safe materials that have rigorous third-party certifications for toxicity and emissions. look for materials and products that are gots certified organic (cu861640) and gols certified organic and carry the greenguard gold certification for extremely low emissions. our ecoair crib mattress is an excellent option. shop natural crib mattress problemchildren's health & learning disorders are linked to toxic chemicalschildren need more rest than adults — from 10 to 14 hours of sleep. studies have shown children who perform poorly in school get less quality sleep than those children that do well. sleep-deprived children often have difficulty concentrating in school, behave poorly, display symptoms of adhd, exhibit poor social skills, and tend to doze off in class. with indoor air quality two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, according to research from epa, it's critical to provide children with healthy, non-toxic spaces to get the rest they need. solutionlook for a healthy mattress that's certified saferemove chemicals such as flame retardants, adhesives, and other questionable chemicals from the products we surround our children with and replace them with lab-tested, natural, and non-toxic ingredients that don't carry the same risk. look for certified products that carry the greenguard gold label. this lab-tested certification has the most strict criteria for emissions standards for chemical exposure and pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (vocs), formaldehyde, and phthalates. gots and gols organic certifications provide validate healthy materials and products, while the coveted made safe® certification shows no use of materials linked to or suspected to cause harm to humans, animals, and ecosystems. shop non-toxic mattresses problemtoxic chemicals, glues, & flame retardants are in many adult mattressesfinding a mattress that respects your health, the environment, and the well-being of everyone in it — at a price point that you can afford, from a brand you can trust — is a challenge. but research suggests that toxic chemicals commonly found in household products play a significant role in the dramatic increase in cancers and other illnesses. so the investment can pay dividends over the life of the mattress for the health and safety of those in your home. solutionchoose a
