(purchases prior to this date are covered by our previous 120 night sleep trial.) how the one year sleep trial works: sleep on your new brentwood home mattress for at least 30 days. your one-year trial period starts upon receipt of your mattress. if you're not happy, let us know via our contact page or web chat. if there is something we can address or fix, we'll try to make it right. after 30 days from receipt of your mattress, if you want to proceed with a return at any point within the first year, we'll start the return process. refunds are paid only after your mattress is received in good condition by brentwood home for recycling or a direct charitable donation is verified. how are mattresses returned? because our mattresses come compressed in a box, you do not have to ship the mattress back to us or try to get it back in the original box. instead, our large and experienced customer service team will work with you to coordinate the return, and will arrange pickup for you. there are no return shipping or restocking fees. although we can have the returned mattress picked up right away by a partner service, our priority is to have the mattress donated to a worthy local nonprofit or responsibly recycled. yes, this takes a bit more coordination and effort, but we firmly believe it is the most responsible and sustainable choice. we cannot and do not resell used mattresses. what exclusions apply? the mattress must be purchased directly from brentwood home. you must be the original purchaser. the one-year sleep trial is non-transferable. if you finance your mattress via affirm®, you’ll receive a full refund for the mattress and shipping from us, but we can not refund financing fees paid-to-date directly to affirm. our sleep trial is limited to one of each applicable product type per household. if you exchange a product, it ends your sleep trial for that product type (mattress, topper, base, sheets, protectors, pads) and no other sleep trials are eligible for your household in the future for that product type. (the only exception is pillows, for which two may be returned from a single order, since they are often bought in pairs.) we define this household-wide policy by your customer name, or shipping address, or billing method/account or billing address. physical abuse or damage to the structure and/or materials, including, but not limited to burns, cuts, tears, and/or liquid damage are not accepted. mold, odors, and/or discoloration caused by abnormal and inappropriate care, including, but not limited to liquid spills, improper ventilation and humid climates and/or areas where the mattress is exposed to excessive water or humidity. mattresses used directly on the floor are excluded, as the combination of body heat, restricted airflow, humidity and the proximity to existing bacterias on a floor may cause molds to form. last updated: may 27, 2020 shop mattresses get inspired, follow us #brentwoodhome questions? we can help: live chat monday - friday6:00am - 4:00pm pst-saturday & sunday6:00am - 2:00pm pst e-mail send us an e-mail: support@brentwoodhome.com or visit our contact page help center our help center can answermost of the questions you may have. visit our help center brentwood home is committed to creating the most comfortable and most natural sleep products as possible to give you your best night's sleep. facebook twitter pinterest instagram shop mattresses bedding babies & kids pet beds gift cards customers my account rewards 1-year sleep trial service members discount help center shipping warranty & returns newsletter company our story blog contact us affirm financing careers sitemap terms & conditions privacy policy become an affiliate guides customer reviews materials we use mattress-in-a-box non-toxic mattress natural latex mattress copyright © 2020 brentwood home. all rights reserved. × cyber sale up to $400 off select mattresses, 20% off yoga pillows and pet beds! shop sale cyber sale! explore our deals on mattresses, yoga pillows and pet beds. ends december 7, 11:59pm pdt. mattresses oceano mattress best-selling #1 rated luxury mattress, 9 layers of premium materials. medium-plush feel. hybrid latex mattress new the mattress, evolved. made entirely from alternative, natural, & recycled materials. provides extraordinary comfort and zoned support. cedar luxe mattress organic the pinnacle of eco-conscious green mattress design. medium to moderately plush experience. cypress memory foam mattress our best-selling and most affordable charcoal-foam mattress now available in hybrid. crystal cove mattress vegan for the active lifestyle, dual-feel, charcoal infused foam & latex. promotes therapeutic recovery & restorative sleep. see all | compare bedding foundations, frames & bases complete your set with our minimalist foundation, frame or adjustable base. sheets, blankets & protectors pillows wedge pillows seat cushions mattress toppers add softness and luxury to your existing mattress with our greenguard gold certified latex or memory foam toppers. replacement covers see all bedding crystal cove yoga the crystal cove yoga pillow collection is 100% certified vegan by vegan action. babies & kids a beautiful collection of natural and non-toxic mattresses and pillows for the little ones. crib & kids mattresses toddler pillow kids pillows crib protector pad new pet beds stylish therapeutic and waterproof pet beds, easy to clean, and beautiful in your home. learn about us 1-year sleep trial help center customer care team reviews materials we use mattress-in-a-box natural latex mattress non-toxic mattresses press relief bed certifications & partnerships blog search
