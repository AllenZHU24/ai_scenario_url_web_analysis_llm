home. problembabies & toddlers are most at risk of toxins & emissionsthe science is clear: physicians, health professionals, public safety officials, and environmental advocacy groups have linked toxic chemicals to the health of our children. research suggests the toxic chemicals found in household products and in our environment are directly linked to childhood disorders and may trigger disabilities such as autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia. that's why the investment in a non-toxic crib mattress is critical. babies and toddlers spend 10 to

have shown children that perform poorly in school get less quality sleep than those children that do well. sleep-deprived children often have difficulty concentrating in school, behave poorly, display symptoms of adhd, exhibit poor social skills, and tend to doze off in class. with indoor air quality two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, according to research from epa, it's critical to provide children with healthy, non-toxic spaces to get the rest they need. solutionlook for a healthy mattress that's certified saferemove chemicals such as flame retardants, adhesives, and other
