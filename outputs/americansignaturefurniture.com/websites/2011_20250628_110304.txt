name='more'></a><br /><br /><u><b>the materials are different</b>&nbsp;</u><br />spring mattresses and foam mattresses aren't very similar when it comes to materials and the way in which they're manufactured.<br /><br />a <b>spring mattress</b> is created using a system of metal coils. layers of cloth padding surround the springs.<br /><br />a <b>foam mattress </b>is made from latex combined with other materials. this type of mattress feels spongy to the touch.<br /><br /><u><b>the firmness level is different</b>&nbsp;</u><br />foam mattresses and spring mattresses both offer firmness in a variety of different levels. find out <a href="http://www.americansignaturefurniture.com/2011/11/choosing-best-mattress-for-your-body.html">which firmness level is the best fit for you</a>.<br /><br

target="_blank">firmness of a<b> spring mattress</b></a> is reflective of the amount and thickness of coils in the coil system. a mattress with a larger number of coils or thicker coils will result in a higher level of firmness.<br /><br />a <b>foam mattress </b>can range from <a

target="_blank">supple to firm</a> and contains small pockets of air. the firmness level of a foam mattress depends on the number and size of air bubbles.<br /><br /><u><b>each mattress type supports your body differently</b>&nbsp;</u><br />the most noticeable difference between how foam and spring mattresses perform is the amount of support each type offers your body.<br /><br />a <b>spring mattress</b> contains coils that are designed to push up on your body with the same amount of pressure. if your figure is curvy or you tend to sleep on your side, this can result in uneven pressure against your body that may leave you feeling sore when you wake up in the morning. however, spring mattresses can support larger amounts of weight over longer time periods than foam mattresses can. spring mattresses are ideal for people who sleep on their backs and heavier body types.<br /><br />a <b>foam mattress </b>distributes even pressure on your body. this type of mattress contours to your shape, surrounding your curves with the correct amount of support over your entire body. this type of mattress is ideal for those who suffer from back and joint pain. a foam mattress also fares well with those who sleep on their sides and curvier figures.<br /><br /><u><b>temperature sensitivity differs greatly</b></u><br />this is another big difference between foam mattresses and spring mattresses.<br /><br />a <b>spring mattress</b> isn't sensitive to temperature.<br /><br /> a <b>foam mattress</b> is sensitive to the heat your body projects. this means a foam mattress can become more supple when heated to higher temperatures. the foam reacts to your shape, creating a custom fit for your body. if you like a cold room when sleeping, temperature sensitivity could be a drawback, as the mattress could stay firmer when you lie down and also take longer to warm up.<br /><br /><u><b>the maintenance levels are different&nbsp;</b></u><br />foam mattresses don't require as much maintenance as spring mattresses.<br /><br />a <b>spring mattress</b> needs to be flipped and rotated to avoid wearing out the coils. if this type of mattress isn't flipped or rotated, valleys may form in places where coils have been worn down.<br /><br />a <b>foam mattress</b> never needs to be flipped or rotated.<br /><br /><u><b>the longevity level is different</b>&nbsp;</u><br />usually, foam mattresses last longer, but the durability of a mattress also depends on the manufacturer, materials used and quality of product.<br /><br />a <b>spring mattress </b>can last anywhere between 7 and 10 years. if your build is on the heavier side, this type of mattress could wear out sooner. though, spring mattresses do tend to last longer than foam mattresses when subjected to heavier weights.<br /><br />a <b>foam mattress</b> can last a long time -- 15 or 20 years! the lifespan of this type of mattress depends on the quality and it doesn't wear well under high pressure. a foam mattress tends to "give out" under heavier weight and may not be able to bounce back to its original state. <br /><br /><u><b>the price is different</b></u><br />the quality of mattresses can vary greatly. you can probably expect to pay a bit more for a foam mattress than a spring mattress. but, you must consider the lifespan of a foam mattress is typically longer and requires less maintenance than a spring mattress.<br /><br />read the top <a href="http://www.americansignaturefurniture.com/2011/12/do-you-really-need-new-mattress_21.html">10 ways to tell if you need a new mattress</a> now.

you go furniture shopping.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>do you have a budget?</b><br />setting realistic expectations of what you can spend on furniture will help you determine where to begin -- from where to shop, to the perfect finishes and fabrics for you. this will help you stick to your price range and not overspend or feel shopper's remorse upon leaving the store. as a smart, bargain-savvy shopper, you'll feel great about each new piece of furniture every time.<br /><br /><b>what is the size of your space?</b><br />&nbsp;a large <a

target="_blank">sectional sofa</a> might not be the best fit for a small living room or studio. and a tiny loveseat won't fill up a larger living area either. be sure to think about what size piece will fit inside the space you wish to furnish. take measurements before you head to the store because eyeballing the size of a sofa or other piece of furniture in a large showroom won't give you an adequate reading.<br /><br /><b>who will use the furniture?&nbsp;</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b>do you have children? what about pets? keep in mind who will actually be using the new furniture. this will help you decide on whether to purchase light colors, dark colors and delicate or strong finishes. this may also help you pick the correct style and size of the piece. do you usually host a lot of guests?

furniture first before heading to the furniture store. but sometimes it can be easy to forget about other challenges that could come between you and your new furniture. one of the biggest challenges of all? the staircase. these helpful tips by <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/roomplanner_10151_-1_10051" target="_blank">american signature furniture</a> will help you move your furniture up, down and around staircases in the smartest and safest way.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><ol><li><b>measure, measure, measure.</b><br /> first, you'll want to make sure that your new furniture will fit through the stairwell. that means measuring the staircase in addition to the furniture piece. measure the hallway leading up the stairs at the narrowest point, such as a turn in the stairs. you should also account for banisters and wall mounted railings, as well as chair rails or other moldings. don't be afraid to get creative if the piece won't fit due to lack of room. can you rotate the furniture? make sure to re-measure for different scenarios you may come across. can you remove the railing temporarily? can the furniture come partially assembled in order to carry it in smaller pieces?&nbsp; </li><br /><li><b>plan ahead.</b> <br />find out who will be helping you move your new furniture. if you purchased a heavy item, <a href="http://www.americansignaturefurniture.com/2012/01/5-things-to-ask-furniture-sales.html">ask your furniture sales associate</a> about delivery pricing. if you opt to pay the delivery fee, make sure to let the store know that a staircase is involved because movers may need to bring extra safety equipment or tools. if you decide to move your new furniture on your own, make sure to form a plan beforehand. pick a time that a moving helper is available. protect your feet by wearing durable, slip resistant shoes. decide who should bear the most weight before you lift a heavy piece and create a plan to turn the piece during every step of the move.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><b>educate yourself. </b><br />so, what if the piece of furniture still won't fit? be sure you take the time to educate

place felt pads on the bottom before you start moving. the felt pads will help protect the floor if you need to set the piece down while moving it. try not to scoot the piece on the pads, as heavy items can still leave marks on the floor. if the final destination of the piece is a hard floor, leave the pads in place to protect the surface for as long as your furniture stays there. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;make sure you know where a piece of furniture is structurally strongest and lift it holding those points. handle &lt;a href=" wcs="" webapp="" www.asfurniture.com="">chairs</a> by gripping the sides of the seat.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>lift furniture straight up using your legs and not your back.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>go slow! it’s worth spending a little extra time—and can save you from costly repairs or even bodily injuries.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>wear nice, comfortable, laced shoes. less protective shoes, like flip-flops, can cause you to stub your foot, drop something on your toe or lose balance on stairs.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>furniture can leave indentations in your carpet if left there for a while. once you move the furniture, the indentations may stay. to remove them, try combing the area or use a fork to fluff the carpet fibers. if the furniture is heavy or it’s been there a while, try vacuuming over each mark. if that still doesn’t work, drop an ice cube in each indentation. let the cubes melt overnight. the next day, when the water spot is completely dry, fluff up the area with a comb, fork or vacuum.&nbsp;</li><br

target="_blank"><u>latex mattresses</u></a>? that's because they're one of the newest types of mattresses in the mattress market. like memory foam, latex mattresses contour to the shape of your body, supporting you evenly as you sleep. they have a similar feel, but they’re actually made of different materials. here are some benefits of latex mattresses to consider if you’re thinking about buying a new bed.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><ol><li><b>they give pressure relief.</b> even support helps relieve pressure points on your body, which improves circulation and alleviates back and joint pain. that makes latex a great option for those with curvy builds, back pain or side sleepers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;</b></li><br /><li><b>they're firmer than foam.</b> while latex mattresses feel similar to foam, they are firmer and more spongy. this may be the perfect solution if you like the feel of foam, but you’re looking for a more firm sleeping option.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><b>they're hypoallergenic.</b> latex mattresses are hypoallergenic and prevent dust mites, so they’re perfect for people with allergy challenges and asthma. for people with latex allergies, experts say there’s usually enough space between your body and the actual latex that you will not have an allergic reaction. however, it’s best to see for yourself by testing one at a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/storelocator_10151_-1_10051">showroom</a>.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><b>they're made with more natural materials.</b> memory foam is often made with harsh chemicals. they have even been linked to itchy eyes, respiratory problems and headaches. on the other hand, latex mattresses are available in 100% natural latex, synthetic latex or a blend. as a result, latex mattresses are some of the healthiest and most eco-friendly mattresses on the market today.is a latex bed perfect for you? read <a

one size, it can seem larger or smaller depending on howyou decorate it. something as simple as furniture size can create the feelingof much more space. here are three solutionsthat can help you use the principles of scale to resize a smaller room.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>less is always more</b><br />think you need to putsmall furniture in a small space? not necessarily! several smaller pieces breakup the space and create a sense of clutter. instead, think about using a fewlarge pieces of focal furniture, <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category__10151_-1_10051_17001_17001_y" target="_blank">decorative accents</a> and wall decorations. this will give the room amuch cleaner look.<br /><br /><b>bigger is always better</b><br />when in doubt, go forbigger furniture pieces than you're normally comfortable with. the bigger thepiece, the bigger statement it will make, and the less accent pieces you'llneed to create a finished look.<br /><br />remember to allow largerfurniture pieces to "breathe." you might think that pushing furniture againstwalls will maximize space. it can actually do the exact opposite! a sofa squishedagainst a wall or a bed in a dark corner gives a cramped look. considerfloating a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17244&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch" target="_blank">sofa</a>in the center of a room and positioning a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17017&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch" target="_blank">bed</a>caddy corner. you'll find that the extra walking space around each piece createsan airy feeling.<br /><br /><b>consider ceiling and seat heights</b><br />take a look at the planes aroundyou and adjust accordingly. if you have a small room with a higher ceiling,make sure to utilize that vertical space. hang wall art up high, choose a sizeableindoor plant or feature a taller piece of focal furniture to draw the eyeupward and create a sense of openness.<br /><br />if you have a small spacewith a shorter ceiling, choose low-lying furniture, like a low <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?storeid=10151&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;langid=-1&amp;searchterm=cocktail+table&amp;stype=simplesearch&amp;searchtype=1000&amp;pagesize=15&amp;beginindex=0&amp;searchsource=q&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;orderby=0" target="_blank">coffee table</a>, platform sofa and even low chairs. this will give the illusion of morespace from standing eye level and as you sit. if you go this route, make sureseat heights are consistent with each other. you don't want one piece to dwarfanother or for guests to struggle holding conversations from multiple heights.<br /><br />read more <a

feel prepared, confident in your decisions andexcited about the transformation that's about to take place in your home.<b></b><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>furniture buying mistake #1: &nbsp;forgetting to measure</b><br />while you might think youhave a good idea of what size furniture you're looking for, it can be difficultto judge size and scale in a showroom setting.<br /><blockquote><b><i>howto avoid it:</i></b> before you headto the furniture store, make detailed notes about the dimensions of the room inyour home where the new furniture will go. that includes the accents and piecesthat go around it, as well. for example, if you're shopping for a new <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17244&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch" target="_blank">couch</a>,know the depth and length of the spot you've selected. did you already purchasea <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtermscope=&amp;searchtype=1000&amp;filterterm=&amp;orderby=0&amp;maxprice=&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;langid=-1&amp;beginindex=0&amp;stype=simplesearch&amp;metadata=&amp;pagesize=15&amp;manufacturer=&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;pageview=image&amp;searchterm=coffee+table&amp;minprice=&amp;urllangid=&amp;categoryid=17001&amp;storeid=10151" target="_blank">coffee table</a>? scribble down its dimensions so that you know you're staying withina similar scale. also, make sure to measure any delivery obstacles, such asnarrow doorways and staircases to make sure you can get the new sofa inside!</blockquote><b>furniture buying mistake #2: guessing a color match</b><br />if you choose to eyeballcolor in order to find a match, you may want to reconsider your color-matchingprocess.<br /><blockquote><b><i>howto avoid it:</i></b> bring as manycolor-matching tools with you as possible and get it right the first time.think accent pillows, paint swatches and fabric samples. window curtain ties orarm covers are great ways to take samples of immobile pieces. make thingseasier and grab your digital camera or cell phone then snap a photo of carpet,artwork or focal points such as fireplaces.</blockquote><b>furniture buying mistake #3: choosing style overfunction</b><br />if you tend to fall inlove with a look and forget how your new piece of furniture will be used, youjust might leave the furniture store without the correct item.<br /><blockquote><i><b>howto avoid it:</b></i> make sure toconsider who will be using the piece, interacting with it and how. do you have adog? children? if you have a pet with white fur, be sure to avoid fabrics darkin color and vice versa. for younger kids and snacking spouses, look to hardwoods that don't scratch easily, durable finishes and washable upholsteryoptions. head into the store with parameters in mind so that you aren't temptedby something that just looks good, but may not fit into your current lifestyle.</blockquote><b>furniture buying mistake #4: buying without testing</b><br />it's very important tosee, touch and test a furniture piece in person before going ahead with apurchase.<br /><blockquote><i><b>howto avoid it:</b></i> if you're an online shopper, try to find your favorites in a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/storelocator_10151_-1_10051" target="_blank">nearby showroom</a>. then, interact with the furniture just as you would at home. if you'relooking at a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17017&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch">bed</a>,get in your favorite sleeping position. if it's a couch, nestle into it the wayyou would before starting a movie. for <a

target="_blank">furniture pieces with drawers</a>, pull the drawers in and out to test how smoothly theymove. then, think through how you would designate drawer space. if you'relooking at a bedroom piece, where will your socks go? pajamas? shirts? makesure everything will fit the way you'd like it to be organized. </blockquote><b>furniture buying mistake #5: not asking for help, orasking too much</b><br />sometimes shoppers don't take advantage of the resources they have right attheir fingertips. and sometimes, they consider too many opinions. they key isto find a balance that helps you make the best possible choice.<br /><blockquote><b><i>howto avoid it:</i></b> take advantage ofthe sales staff's knowledge about furniture brands. these helpful people canshow you additional options you would like, but otherwise may not have noticedin the showroom. they can also inform you about the best value items, brandreputation and customized options you may not have been aware of. they willalso be able to help you discover important <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/helpview?storeid=10151&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;langid=-1&amp;usertype=g&amp;userstate=&amp;userid=-1002" target="_blank">warranty</a>,<a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/contactus_10151_-1_10051" target="_blank">delivery services</a> and special order details that will help you with your finaldecision. </blockquote><br />askingyour friends and family members for opinions can sometimes be a good choice,but keep the questions to a minimum. if you hear too many conflictingviewpoints, you just may wind up even more confused. when you go shopping forfurniture, take just one person with you like your partner or a good friend whoknows you well. this person may be able to point things out that you have yetto consider. <br /><br />at the end of the day, trust your own opinionand instincts above all others. after all, you know your lifestyle best and you'rethe one who will be enjoying your furniture every day for years to come.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1'

a few ways to make a smallspace feel less cramped and more cozy.<b></b><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>1. accentuate your space with smart storage</b><br />a great way to make a roomfeel more open is to get rid of extra clutter. because clutter breaks up aspace visually, it can give a room the appearance of being smaller than it reallyis. try <a

the ottoman with a serving tray, and it can evendouble as a <a

target="_blank">coffee table</a>. <br /><br />another example of a smartstorage accent is floating shelves. these can add storage space to wallswithout the addition of extra furniture. remember: the more floor that's madevisible, the more spacious the room will feel.<br /><br /><b>2. get strategic with furniture; avoid clutter</b><br />clutter is our number oneno-no. so rather than arranging several small pieces of furniture, considersome large statement pieces. and don't shy away from giving them some space! allowa couch to float in the middle of the room, or place a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category__10151_-1_10051_17014_17014_y" target="_blank">bed</a>caddy-corner. <br /><br />when choosing furniturepieces for a small space, go for low and light. <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17237&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch" target="_blank">sectional sofas</a> and platform beds lay low in a space creating an airy, open look tothe eye. lighter-colored furniture also blends in with the background moreseamlessly, creating an appearance of a much larger plane.<br /><br />resizable furniture canalso be a great choice. when you aren't entertaining, <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17109&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch"

target="_blank">removable leaves</a> can come in handy. multi-use seating, such as a <a

target="_blank">bench</a>,paired with an adjustable table can save space as well. when the leaves of thetable aren't being used, the bench can then be placed under a window for extrastorage or seating.<br /><br /><b>3. it's all about lights and mirrors</b><br />let your small space floodwith natural light by uncovering your windows as much as possible. the extralight with give an airy feel to a smaller room. another bright idea?lighter-colored walls. the sunlight from the open windows will illuminatethem--and the room--even more. <br /><br />for spaces without a lotof windows, placing a <a href="http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/searchdisplay?searchtype=1000&amp;resultcatentrytype=2&amp;pageview=image&amp;catalogid=10051&amp;orderby=4&amp;showresultspage=true&amp;categoryid=17013&amp;beginindex=0&amp;langid=-1&amp;storeid=10151&amp;stype=simplesearch" target="_blank">wall mirror</a> purposefully where it will catch and reflect the most sunlight willhelp. because they create the illusion of a window to more space, mirrors makea great option. <br /><br />if you wish to add a splash of color to thelighter, neutral palette, consider adding a bold hue to the ceiling instead ofthe walls. this design tactic will draw the eye upward and therefore elongatesa smaller space making it appear bigger.<br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="enhanced by zemanta"><img alt="enhanced by zemanta"
