scribble down its dimensions so that you know you're staying within a similar scale. also, make sure to measure any delivery obstacles, such as narrow doorways and staircases to make sure you can get the new sofa inside! furniture buying mistake #2: guessing a color match if you choose to eyeball color in order to find a match, you may want to reconsider your color-matching process. how to avoid it: bring as many color-matching tools with you as possible and get it right the first time. think accent pillows, paint swatches and fabric samples. window curtain ties or arm covers are great ways to take samples of immobile pieces. make things easier and grab your digital camera or cell phone then snap a photo of carpet, artwork or focal points such as fireplaces. furniture buying mistake #3: choosing style over function if you tend to fall in love with a look and forget how your new piece of furniture will be used, you just might leave the furniture store without the correct item. how to avoid it: make sure to consider who will be using the piece, interacting with it and how. do you have a dog? children? if you have a pet with white fur, be sure to avoid fabrics dark in color and vice versa. for younger kids and snacking spouses, look to hard woods that don't scratch easily, durable finishes and washable upholstery options. head into the store with parameters in mind so that you aren't tempted by something that just looks good, but may not fit into your current lifestyle. furniture buying mistake #4: buying without testing it's very important to see, touch and test a furniture piece in person before going ahead with a purchase. how to avoid it: if you're an online shopper, try to find your favorites in a nearby showroom. then, interact with the furniture just as you would at home. if you're looking at a bed, get in your favorite sleeping position. if it's a couch, nestle into it the way you would before starting a movie. for armoires or other furniture pieces with drawers, pull the drawers in and out to test how smoothly they move. then, think through how you would designate drawer space. if you're looking at a bedroom piece, where will your socks go? pajamas? shirts? make sure everything will fit the way you'd like it to be organized. furniture buying mistake #5: not asking for help, or asking too much sometimes shoppers don't take advantage of the resources they have right at their fingertips. and sometimes, they consider too many opinions. they key is to find a balance that helps you make the best possible choice. how to avoid it: take advantage of the sales staff's knowledge about furniture brands. these helpful people can show you additional options you would like, but otherwise may not have noticed in the showroom. they can also inform you about the best value items, brand reputation and customized options you may not have been aware of. they will also be able to help you discover important warranty, delivery services and special order details that will help you with your final decision. asking your friends and family members for opinions can sometimes be a good choice, but keep the questions to a minimum. if you hear too many conflicting viewpoints, you just may wind up even more confused. when you go shopping for furniture, take just one person with you like your partner or a good friend who knows you well. this person may be able to point things out that you have yet to consider. at the end of the day, trust your own opinion and instincts above all others. after all, you know your lifestyle best and you're the one who will be enjoying your furniture every day for years to come. tuesday, december 13, 2011 | categories armoires , bed , before you buy , cocktail table , coffee table , couch , featured , sofas no comment yet post a comment older post home newer post subscribe to: post comments (atom) recent comments popular articles resizing for smaller spaces using scale a few factors to consider when buying furniture how to make a small room look bigger 5 furniture buying mistakes to avoid 5 things to ask a furniture sales associate blog archive ► 2012 (8) ► january (8) foam mattresses and spring mattresses: is there a ... 5 things to ask yourself before buying new furnitu... how to find your furniture style better sleep starts with a better mattress before you buy furniture, consider the size of you... how to rearrange furniture safely 5 things to ask a furniture sales associate 4 big benefits of latex beds ▼ 2011 (6) ▼ december (6) resizing for smaller spaces using scale do you really need a new mattress?
