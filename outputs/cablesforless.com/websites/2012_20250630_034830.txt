resolutions to 4k by 2k - top-of-the-line digital cinema projectors are capable of 4k by 2k (4,000 lines wide by 2,000 lines high - roughly four times the resolution of a 1080p display). such projectors will allow high-end home theaters to produce a movie experience similar to commercial movie theaters. our performance and ultra hdmi cables are ready to handle the very high bandwidth that digital cinema projectors require. 120hz / 240hz / 600hz refresh rates - your equipment (i.e. dvd player, tv, etc.) will ultimately determine the refresh rate at which your tv will operate; our cables will support any refresh rate found in consumer electronic devices on the market today. 10.2gbps transfer rate - our hdmi cables have been tested to transfer data at speeds above and beyond current hdmi specifications. ethernet channel - one of the most exciting new features of the current hdmi revision is the addition of ethernet support. this means that many new devices will soon need only 1 cable for hd video, multi-channel audio and internet! audio return channel - if your hdtv has a built-in tuner, it may also be capable of sending an audio signal back to your audio receiver. with our hdmi cables making the connection, you won't have to make a separate connection for audio; there is a channel built right into the cable specifically for this. additional color spaces - some higher-end displays can show more colors than the average tv. technologies such as "deep color" and "x.v.color" can produce a very high quality picture, with stunning levels of detail. our hdmi cables will fully support these technologies. 3d capability - watch your home theater come alive with 3d!
