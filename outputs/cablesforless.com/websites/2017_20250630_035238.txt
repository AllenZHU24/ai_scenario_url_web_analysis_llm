this simply means that our hdmi cables conform to the latest revision of the hdmi standard, offering you some very exciting new features! to learn more about hdmi, check this out. gold-plated tip - gold is an excellent conductor of electricity, and also helps prevent corrosion. ideal for high definition satellite / cable - most hd satellite / cable boxes currently output a maximum resolution of 1080i @ 60hz, with a few exceptions such as pay-per-view programming. this means that standard quality hdmi cables are capable of supporting your hd programming, but higher quality hdmi cables are more "future-proof." resolutions to 1080p / 1440p - most tvs on the market today will boast a maximum resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) @ 120hz, which results in a very clear picture. rest assured that our hdmi cables are designed not only to support the audio / video equipment of today; our hdmi cables are also ready to support the audio / video equipment of tomorrow, for years to come! resolutions to 4k by 2k - top-of-the-line digital cinema projectors are capable of 4k by 2k (4,000 lines wide by 2,000 lines high - roughly four times the resolution of a 1080p display). such projectors will allow high-end home theaters to produce a movie experience similar to commercial movie theaters. our performance and ultra hdmi cables are ready to handle the very high bandwidth that digital cinema projectors require. 120hz / 240hz / 600hz refresh rates - your equipment (i.e. dvd player, tv, etc.) will ultimately determine the refresh rate at which your tv will operate; our cables will support any refresh rate found in consumer electronic devices on the market today. 18gbps transfer rate - our hdmi cables have been tested to transfer data at speeds above and beyond current hdmi specifications. ethernet channel - one of the most exciting new features of the current hdmi revision is the addition of ethernet support. this means that many new devices will soon need only 1 cable for hd video, multi-channel audio and internet! audio return channel - if your hdtv has a built-in tuner, it may also be capable of sending an audio signal back to your audio receiver. with our hdmi cables making the connection, you won't have to make a separate connection for audio; there is a channel built right into the cable specifically for this. additional color spaces - some higher-end displays can show more colors than the average tv. technologies such as "deep color" and "x.v.color" can produce a very high quality picture, with stunning levels of detail. our hdmi cables will fully support these technologies. 3d capability - watch your home theater come alive with 3d! many new devices on the market today offer this exciting new feature. our performance and ultra cables are ready to go! in-wall rated - cl2 rating meets building / fire code for new construction and existing structures. our in-wall hdmi cables will have no trouble passing inspection. ideal for xbox one & playstation 4 - get the most out of your high definition gaming experience! our performance and ultra hdmi cables will work perfectly with your xbox one or playstation 4 (ps4)! ideal for blu-ray - blu-ray players make use of the most advanced hdmi features; a higher quality hdmi cable is recommended to ensure that all of these features are properly experienced. braided mesh protector - for the ultimate protection! this nylon mesh is fire resistant, and adds another layer of protection to your investment! heavy duty construction - built tough for rugged conditions, our ultra hdmi cables feature a protective nylon braid, heavier-gauge wire and full-metal head shells to ensure maximum, consistent performance in any environment. perfect for trade shows or any other high-traffic situation. wire gauge - wire gauge, in conjunction with the length of cable, can ultimately affect your hd experience, especially when using higher-end devices such as a blu-ray player; it is generally better to use a heavier-gauge wire when using these higher-end devices. head shell construction - to put it simply, a full-metal head shell offers the most durability, and more importantly - the greatest protection against emi (electromagnetic interference). the back panel of your receiver is a busy place, with quite a few cables and connectors all coming in close contact with one another. our ultra hdmi cables will offer the best protection against potential interference! sign up for our newsletter name email quick links about us backorders company info faq fiber optics explained hours and hoidays learn more copyrightpayment optionsreturnstestimonials network cabling basics non-returnable products privacy policy shipping info terms and conditions which hdmi cable do i buy? shipping & returns contact us rss syndication categories custom cables custom audio cable assemblies custom cable calculators audio cable calculators cat5e and cat6 cable calculators d-sub cable calculators fiber cable calculators miscellaneous cable calculators rca and bnc cable calculators video cable calculators custom video cable assemblies misc custom cable assemblies fiber optic 62.5/125 multimode fiber fc to mtrj 62.5/125 patch cables lc to fc 62.5/125 patch cables lc to lc 62.5/125 patch cables lc to mtrj 62.5/125 patch cables lc to sc 62.5/125 patch cables lc to st 62.5/125 patch cables mtrj to mtrj 62.5/125 patch cables sc to fc 62.5/125 patch cables sc to mtrj 62.5/125 patch cables sc to sc 62.5/125 patch cables sc to st 62.5/125 patch cables st to fc 62.5/125 patch cables st to mtrj 62.5/125 patch cables st to st 62.5/125 patch cables 50/125 multimode fiber lc to lc 50/125 patch cables lc to sc 50/125 patch cables lc to st 50/125 patch cables sc to sc 50/125 patch cables 10 gigabit, 50/125 multimode fiber lc to lc 10 gigabit, 50/125 jumpers lc to sc 10 gigabit, 50/125 jumpers sc to sc 10 gigabit, 50/125 jumpers singlemode fiber singlemode apc fiber lc-apc/lc-apc jumpers lc-upc/lc-apc jumpers lc-upc/sc-apc jumpers sc-apc/sc-apc jumpers sc-upc/sc-apc jumpers lc to fc singlemode jumpers lc to lc singlemode jumpers lc to mtrj singlemode jumpers lc to sc singlemode jumpers lc to st singlemode jumpers fc to fc singlemode jumpers fc to mtrj singlemode jumpers mtrj to mtrj singlemode jumpers sc to fc singlemode jumpers sc to mtrj singlemode jumpers sc to sc singlemode jumpers sc to st singlemode jumpers st to fc singlemode jumpers st to mtrj singlemode jumpers st to st singlemode jumpers om4 50/125 multimode fiber lc to lc om4, 50/125 jumpers lc to sc om4, 50/125 jumpers sc to sc om4, 50/125 jumpers mtp/mpo fiber products mtp/mpo fiber optic cassettes om3 cassettes om4 cassettes mtp/mpo fiber optic fan-outs lc fan-outs sc fan-outs mtp/mpo fiber optic trunks mtp female to female trunks mtp male to male trunks mode conditioning fiber mode conditioning lc fiber mode conditioning sc fiber mode conditioning st fiber rack mount fiber patch panels modular patch panel system modular patch panel adapters modular patch panel plates multimode loaded patch panels singlemode loaded patch panels fiber optic termination boxes pigtails and fan out kits fiber optic fan out kits fiber optic pigtails 12 fiber pigtails 6 fiber pigtails clearance -
