the keurig® 2.0 thermal carafe is not designed for keurig® k-cup® or keurig® vue® brewers. it is specially designed to work with the keurig® 2.0 brewer to provide you with a perfect four-cup carafe every time. why am i getting grounds in my cup? coffee grounds may have gathered in the exit needle. to clean the needle, follow these steps: • remove and clean the exit needle in accordance with the k-cup™ holder cleaning instructions. • perform a small-cup cleansing brew and look for any grounds coming out. • repeat cleansing brews to clear out any residual grounds. • if you are using the my k-cup® reusable coffee filter, please make sure that you are using a course-drip. you should only fill the mesh basket to the bottom of the brown band, which is approximately 2.5 tbs. if you have not done so recently, it is also recommended that you de-scale your brewer. please refer to the de-scaling instructions. how do i fix a short cup? if your brewer is not brewing the full amount selected, it may be caused by the following: • the exit needle is clogged by coffee grounds or cocoa mix. please refer to the k-cup™ holder cleaning instructions. • the brewer may need to be descaled. please refer to the descaling instructions. • the removable water reservoir was removed during brewing. place the water reservoir back onto the brewer and perform a cleansing brew without a portion pod. how much power does the brewer use? keurig home brewers use the most power during their initial startup. when heating for the first time after being off, peak usage is 1,500 watts. if the power is kept on, the brewer will keep the internal tank up to temperature using between 200 – 400 watts when heating. while idle and not maintaining heat, the brewer will use the average electricity of a 60 watt light bulb. all keurig home brewers are equipped with an energy savings mode auto off feature should you choose not to leave the brewer on. the initial heating mode when turning the power on should take about three minutes. how hot is the water in the brewer? keurig believes that the optimal temperature for brewing coffee, tea and hot cocoa is 192° f. this is the internal temperature of the water in your brewer. however, once your coffee, tea or hot cocoa is brewed, the dispensed temperature can vary greatly. in-cup temperature depends on the cup temperature and material. when brewing into an insulated container, such as a foam or paper cup, 180-185°f in-cup temperature is typically attained. in addition, dispensing into a cold ceramic mug will cool the coffee significantly. please note that stream temperature of the first brew after turn-on or after an extended idle period can be a couple degrees cooler. to maximize initial in-cup temperature at home, we recommend running a small cup cleansing-brew prior to brewing a k-cup® pod, which warms both the mug and the brewer. can i change the internal temperature? several keurig brewers and keurig licensed brewers are designed with an adjustable internal brew temperature. models with this feature include the special edition, ultimate, platinum, select, cuisinart, breville and officepro® premier. these brewers allow you to adjust the pre-set temperature of 192°f down by 5 degrees for a temperature range of 187-192°f. can i use a home brewer in my office? keurig strongly recommends that our home brewers be used at home and our commercial brewers be placed in commercial/office settings. that is why our home brewers are ul listed for household use only and our commercial brewers are ul listed for commercial use only. if you would like to purchase a brewer for your home visit our home brewer’s page. if you would like to purchase a brewer for a small to medium office please consider our small-medium office brewers that can be purchased directly at keurig.com. who should i contact if i need support for my keurig licensed brewer?

and store your brewer in a safe and frost-free environment. please be sure to store your brewer in its upright position to avoid water leakage from the inner tank. if you store the brewer in a cold environment, you run the risk of water freezing inside the brewer and causing damage. when you prepare to use it after storage, we recommend rinsing the removable water reservoir with fresh water and running three cleansing brews without a portion pod. if you plan to move your brewer to a different location, turn the brewer off, unplug it and empty the removable water reservoir. if your brewer has been in an environment below freezing, please be sure to let it warm to room temperature for two hours before brewing. how does the water filter work? how do i install it? instructions filter your

fact that your brewer needs de-scaling every 3-6 months. to use the water filter, soak and insert the filter cartridge in the bottom of the handle assembly. simply grasp the handle and insert it into

primary objective with the my k-cup® filter accessory. the brewer heads between our classic keurig® k-cup brewers and our keurig® 2.0 systems are different, so at this time, the only way to ensure

system. which brewer models are compatible with each of the my k-cup® filter accessories? • the original my k-cup® filter accessory is compatible with all of our classic keurig® k-cup® brewers,

issue here. can i brew more than once using the same coffee grounds? for optimal flavor and taste, brewing more than once with the same grounds is not recommended. general brewer information why is water important? coffee and tea are over 98% water so quality drinking water is necessary to produce a quality beverage. we don’t recommend the use of softened water or distilled water. bottled or spring water works best when brewing with your keurig. the most common concern with water for brewing is the "hardness" of the water. this refers to various natural minerals found in water such as magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, sulfate and chloride. the number of grains of dissolved minerals changes the level of soluble solids extracted from the coffee and tea. as hard water passes through the brewer, it produces deposits of scale or lime. this reduces the life and efficiency of the equipment, and affects the brew flavor; bottled or filtered water should be used to solve this problem. keurig also recommends descaling your brewer at least every 3-6 months depending on your water source. brewer materials for most keurig® home brewers, you may purchase a

between home brewers and commercial brewers all keurig brewers and keurig licensed brewers share the same innovative technology that ensures a fresh-brewed, perfect beverage every time. however, keurig does market separate home and work brewers with features and ul certification appropriate for their intended use. brewers that are engineered for home use, are ul listed for household use only, and thus should not be used in a commercial/office setting. in general, these brewers are designed for typical home use – including features and aesthetics most appropriate for a kitchen environment. all home brewers can be purchased on keurig.com and specific models can be purchased through our retail partners. to find out which home brewer is right for you: view all home brewers keurig commercial brewers are ul listed for commercial use only. if you would like to purchase a brewer for a small to medium office please consider our small-medium office brewers that can be purchased directly at keurig.com or, if you require something for your larger office, we would be happy to have a keurig authorized distributor contact you. using a keurig brewer at high altitudes while keurig brewers are made to be used at elevations up to 6,000 ft., portion pods may need to be pre-punctured prior to brewing to release the pressure inside. to do this simply drop the k-cup® pod into the k-cup® chamber and push down slowly so that the bottom of the k-cup® pod is punctured by the exit needle in the bottom of the chamber. also, the keurig special edition, ultimate, platinum, select and officepro® premier brewers are equipped with a temperature control so you may want to experiment lowering the brew temperature in elevated areas. additionally, the k2.0 has a specific ‘high altitude’ setting to enable for use in high altitudes. user guides keurig® k-10 mini plus brewer user guide keurig® k-45 elite brewer user guide keurig® k75 platinum brewer user guide keurig® special
