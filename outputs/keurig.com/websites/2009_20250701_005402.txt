(gmcr) is a leader in developing fair trade/organic coffee blends that are great for coffee lovers, coffee growers, and our planet. also gmcr is repeatedly cited for best practices in business ethics. as such, we’d like to share what we are doing at keurig and what we are doing in cooperation with gmcr to build a better world for both gourmet coffee lovers…and lovers of best practices in corporate responsibility. sustainable packaging k-cup® portion pack packaging is an area of major environmental concern for all consumer product companies. as the single-cup coffee market and our keurig brewing systems grow in popularity, we understand that the impact of the k-cup® portion pack waste stream is one of our most significant environmental challenges. the k-cup package is made up of three main elements -- the cup itself, a filter and an aluminum foil top. the polyethylene coating of the foil - as well as the process of heat-sealing the various elements - makes recycling difficult. however, this packaging approach prevents oxygen, light and moisture from degrading the coffee. without the barrier the packaging materials provide, we could not maintain the quality and freshness of the coffee, which means that all the resources and effort put into growing and roasting great coffee would be wasted. finding a more environmentally-friendly approach to this packaging challenge is a big priority for us. we are working on a few different fronts to improve the environmental characteristics of the k-cup® system, as well as to mitigate its impact. here’s what we are doing we are actively researching alternatives to the the k-cup® portion pack’s petroleum –based materials we are conducting a life cycle analysis to help us understand the overall environmental impact of the k-cup® portion pack as compared to the use of a typical drip- brewer.there are environmental considerations at every step on the road from “tree to cup”. by studying the k-cup over its entire life cycle, we can more clearly understand how and where we can reduce its footprint. we are working to identify the right definition of "environmentally friendly" for all our packaging, including the k-cup portion pack. for example it could mean carbon-neutral, made with renewable materials, recyclable, biodegradable, compostable, petroleum-free, all of the above, or something entirely different. we are researching what is possible today and tomorrow, taking into account the current state of packaging technology, consumer preferences, community infrastructure, performance requirements, and the demands of the marketplace. we also continue to offer the my k-cup, a reusable filter cartridge assembly that can be refilled by the consumer, is easily cleaned, and is compatible with all keurig home brewers sold today. other keurig initiatives: rohs the rohs directive is a set of european regulations designed to reduce the effect of electronic equipment in the waste stream. europe is at the forefront in introducing regulations to better protect the environment. the united states is catching up, but we decided not to wait and have started to implement the rohs directive in all our brewers. we expect to be fully rohs compliant with all our brewers by the end of 2008. power saving-energy conservation many of you have asked if our brewers are energy star rated. the answer is no. even though our brewers are not energy star rated, our at home brewers all have an auto-off feature that when selected turns the brewer off a preset time after the last brew. for the non programmable brewers it is 2 hours. for the programmable brewers it is selectable from 1-9 hours. these also feature programmable start and stop times. when these features are used they provide considerable energy savings. recycling brewers we have started to add the appropriate recycling symbols to the plastic parts of our brewers. this will assist both consumers and recycling facilities to properly identify and recycle these components. summary we hope this environmental statement has been helpful. if you have further questions or comments, please contact john phillips at keurig, email john.phillips@keurig.com keurig.com  |  at home  |  explore  |  at work  |  hospitality  |  help  |  company © keurig, incorporated . all rights reserved. privacy policy  |  sitemap 1-866-901-brew (2739)
