us › ross-simons history ross-simons is committed to providing an extraordinary shopping experience since 1952, we've worked hard to guarantee your complete satisfaction with any ross-simons purchase. we're not happy until you are! the very first ross-simons retail store opened in historic providence, rhode island in 1952 with a mission to provide exceptional quality jewelry and luxury items at the most affordable prices possible. as the concept took off, the company quickly expanded — our second and third stores followed in 1965 and 1975, and our first catalog was mailed in 1981. today, ross-simons is a thriving multi-channel retailer. in addition to our web presence, we mail more than 50 million catalogs annually across the globe and operate two outlet stores and our flagship store in warwick, ri. in august 2013, sidney thomas jewelers opened nine high end stores in the spaces previously branded as ross-simons jewelers. the new brand is a reflection of sidney thomas ross, a jewelry visionary in his own right and the founder of ross-simons in 1952. though the times may have changed, our focus remains the same: a commitment to service and satisfaction, providing the finest jewelry, tableware, collectibles and more at legendary prices. we owe our long history of success to loyal customers like you, and we look forward to serving you for many years to come. sincerely,
