goods/accessories with his entrepreneurial spirit to create a new company. the company began selling product in several high volume flea markets in the midwest before selling through ebay. sales on ebay launched our website that has grown from storing product in the family basement to expansion that includes a multi-unit warehouse facility that now houses almost all operations.with a commitment to exceptional customer service and affordable, quality goods, beltoutlet.com went online with its own web store in 1999. over a decade later and with more than a million customers served, the same

service to our customers, providing quality goods at affordable prices.in 2012, we opened a new webstore, goinstyle.com, to offer a new selection of men’s and women’s accessories and travel goods

associates and whomever we encounter in our daily walk.one aspect of our philosophy, “we sell to help,” is based on our commitment to helping people in need through charitable giving. more than 15% of

business) samaritan’s purse international relief (disaster relief/community development) compassion international (child poverty) the salvation army (disaster relief, youth, elderly, etc.) loaves and fishes (community food pantry) feed my starving children (world hunger) national breast cancer foundation most importantly, what drives us in determining how we act in business and our personal lives is how we answer the following questions:where did we come from?why is there evil in the world?why are we here?what happens when we die?if you are searching for answers to these questions, please consider reading the gospel of john in the bible. jesus said, “that i am the way, the truth and the life…” listed below are books and web sites that can help you in your search. if you would like to
