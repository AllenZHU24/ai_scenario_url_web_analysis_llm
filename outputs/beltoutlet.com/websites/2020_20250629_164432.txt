business. our company’s founder decided to partner his knowledge of retail buying, manufacturing and leather goods/accessories with his entrepreneurial spirit to create a new company. the company began selling product in several high volume flea markets in the midwest before selling through ebay. sales on ebay launched our website beltoutlet.com that has grown from storing product in the family basement to expansion that includes a multi-unit office and warehouse facility that houses all operations. with a commitment to exceptional customer service and affordable, quality goods, beltoutlet.com went online with its own web store in 1999. more than two decades later, the company also sells most of its product lines on third party marketplaces such as amazon, walmart, ebay, sears, overstock, and several international marketplaces. in 2016, plg acquired the rights to crookhorndavis, a luxury men's accessories brand founded in 1948. currently located in bolingbrook, illinois, our entire staff is dedicated to providing you with a wonderful shopping experience by combining great products, unbeatable prices and outstanding service. shop now contact us 1-888-355-2358
