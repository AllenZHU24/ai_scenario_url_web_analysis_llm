factoring in shipping, the prices still beat their competitors for just the item cost. the standard shipping came within a couple of days (much quicker than i expected), and i am thrilled with my new item. i highly recommend beltoutlet.com to anyone who is looking for a high quality wallet for a low price. i got the eel skin money clip and the magnet is the strongest i've ever had in any of my past money clips." shop eel skin money clip cathy d. texas "i bought a silver shawl and received it timely. it looks good and the price was excellent. i am happy i found your website because i just couldn't afford to pay the price some websites were asking for a simple shawl. i will be using you again as needed, thanks for your quick delivery." shop shawls patricia g. pennsylvania "beltoutlet.com's website is super easy to navigate. i appreciate the suggestions on how best to place an order to minimize the shipping costs. their delivery is very speedy - even though i did not place an expedited order, i received the order extremely quickly. i also like that they plainly indicate their membership with the better business bureau on their check out page. i will definitely be a return customer." juan m. washington, d.c. "the items were as advertised and delivered quickly. i would order from beltoutlet.com again." neil m. alaska "products clearly presented and described, very efficient ordering process, prompt delivery of item i ordered. very satisfied with this seller." john h. connecticut "this merchant offers 2 spectacular fanny packs in buttery soft leather with a myriad of pocket compartments to keep the things that are too bulky for trouser or coat pockets and things that would stack one on top of another in a pocket book or backpack. all pockets have smoothly operating zippers and some have mesh compartments for even more organization. the design is practical and the craftsmanship is beyond criticism. it would still be a tremendous value if it were priced even higher. the merchant maintains a person-friendly simple-to-understand website with plain and straightforward ordering capability. the merchant is very fair with postage and handling and ships immediately. my fanny pack arrived within in a couple of days. the packaging is consistently professional. i would grade this merchant with an a in every aspect of online buying. to put it another way, if you are considering purchasing your fanny pack elsewhere, it won't be nearly as good in terms of functionality and high quality and likely will never last as long for what you will have paid. for a couple of bucks more you don't have to compromise and you can get the best!" shop fanny packs albert m. massachusetts "happy with the choice of fanny packs. purchase was without a hitch." shop fanny packs thomas b. south dakota "great products at great prices. leather goods too! you will be able to find unique gifts and items that you didn't know existed. fantastic leather wallets, gloves, belts, and gifts for men and women. i have been a satisfied customer for 5 years." berge b. california "the suspenders are high quality and just what i wanted. they arrived very quickly, actually sooner than i expected." shop suspenders robert c. new jersey "had to return a belt and replace it with another. no problems and fast refund. great place." shop belts spencer c. iowa "beltoutlet.com was exactly what i needed. a huge selection of belts with quick and efficient shipping. i will definitely be visiting again once i wear these out!" shop belts caryn m. new york "it was my first time ordering from this company. i ordered a few items as christmas gifts sometime in beginning of december. one of the items arrived in the wrong color. i emailed them immediately, and almost as quickly, i received a response with an apology and a promise that the correct color would arrive asap. it felt like the next day, but maybe it was 2 days later, the correct item arrived with a pre-paid shipping label to return the incorrect item. everything arrived in plenty of time for christmas and i would definitely order from here again." victoria t. oregon "this is my second review of beltoutlet.com that i am pleased to give since i had two orders within 2 weeks of each other. the service was great and the quality of the products was excellent plus the shipping was super fast. many thanks to beltoutlet.com. you are the best!" john f. washington "i have been buying from beltoutlet.com for several years. i am very happy with their products and their speedy shipping." steve w. virginia "great experience. the wallet insert i wanted was out of stock, and i could find no other place on the internet that carried it. beltoutlet.com had an option for me to sign up to receive notice when it was in stock again. i did, knowing that i was probably wasting my time, as i rarely hear back from merchants in these situations. much to my (pleasant) surprise, i received an e-mail from beltoutlet.com about 2 weeks later informing me the item was back in stock! i ordered it right away and it arrived a few days later. highly recommended seller!" shop wallets anonymous n/a “after looking at a multitude of sun hats, bucket hats and boonies, i ran across reviews for tilley hats. sadly, even though i’m 62 years old, i had not heard of tilley (as i’m not a hat wearer) let alone think of paying $80 for a hat. well long story short - after reading all the glowing reviews by happy tilley hat wearers on every site i searched, i decided to jump in and recently purchased the tilley t5mo organic cotton model as my first tilley for an upcoming trip to mexico. i agonized for days over the size issue as there are no local stores that carry this item. i worried about the 2 finger rule and people saying it should be loose, but i ordered a 7 1/2 based on tilley sizing guidelines. the hat did fit and was a little loose but i still worried if it was loose enough (by now my wife thinking i’ve lost my mind over ordering a simple hat). so i ordered another hat in a 7 5/8 size. the hat felt a bit looser on my head but i still could not decide on which one to get. it was not until i figured out the magic held in the rear strap that my mind was made up. this device is just pure genius by tilley. by adjusting the rear strap when you wear the hat you can snug any looseness up with no problem. once i figured that out i took the 7 5/8 hat as a keeper. i wore the hat the first time to an outdoor blues and wine festival recently and it was just perfect. it was 90 degrees that day with no shade, but even though i did sweat a little (who wouldn’t) the hat shaded the sun perfectly and i could feel the air circulating through the crown. final verdict: i love my tilley. i’m sad i didn’t find this sooner in my life and i can’t wait to wear it in mexico (and more!). and lest i forget to include that beltoutlet.com was just great during the purchase process and delivered my items without a problem.” shop tilley totes about us contact us popular searches volume sales privacy policy affiliates customer favorites site map my account order status my cart returns & exchanges shipping & handling faq testimonials mail order form stay informed sign up for our newsletter & receive 10% off!
