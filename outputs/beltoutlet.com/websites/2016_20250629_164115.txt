manufacturing and leather goods/accessories with his entrepreneurial spirit to create a new company. the company began selling product in several high volume flea markets in the midwest before selling through ebay. sales on ebay launched our website beltoutlet.com that has grown from storing product in the family basement to expansion that includes a multi-unit office and warehouse facility that houses all operations. with a commitment to exceptional customer service and affordable, quality goods, beltoutlet.com went online with its own web store in 1999. nearly two decades later, the company also sells most of its product lines on third party marketplaces such as amazon, ebay, sears, jet, walmart and several international marketplaces. currently located in plainfield, illinois, our entire staff is dedicated to providing you with a wonderful shopping experience by combining great products, unbeatable prices and outstanding service. customer service we strive for perfection in our
