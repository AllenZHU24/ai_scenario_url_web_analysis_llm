pull tight). order options are given in inches and hat sizes. how do i clean my hat? perspiration will definitely affect the look of your hat, usually resulting in white (salt) stains or dark (oil) stains around the crown. these can usually be cleaned with a diluted mixture of dawn dish soap and warm water. do not submerge the hat but rather use a clean sponge to dab the stains. dry it immediately with a clean paper towel, absorbing all of the excess water from the hat. this step may need to be repeated several times depending on the staining. use this same method on the inner sweatband to remove the dirt. again, several applications may be required. to help prevent future staining, wipe off all of the excess moisture after removing your hat. if it is very wet, turn it upside down and fold out the sweatband to allow the moisture to evaporate into the air. these suggestions should add some additional time to the life of your hat. when the time does come for a new hat, please think of beltoutlet.com. what size belt should i order? generally, we recommend buying a belt one full size above your even number waist (pant) size. for example, if you wear a 34 waist garment, please order a size 36 belt. our belts are measured from the third hole, down the length of the belt, not including the buckle. how do i measure suspenders? to measure for suspenders, begin measurement on the front, right side of your body at the top of your pants (where the clips will fasten) and go over the shoulder and down to the left side, top of the pants (where the clips will fasten). this measurement will work for x-back style suspenders and y-back style suspenders. contact us 1-888-355-2358 • service@beltoutlet.com home about us contact us customer reviews product
