bought a silver shawl and received it timely. it looks good and the price was excellent. i am happy i found your website because i just couldn't afford to pay the price some websites were asking for a simple shawl. i will be using you again as needed, thanks for your quick delivery." cathy d. - texas"products clearly presented and described, very efficient ordering process, prompt delivery of item i ordered. very satisfied with this seller." neil m. - alaska"beltoutlet.com's website is super easy to navigate. i appreciate the suggestions on how best to place an order to minimize the shipping costs. their delivery is very speedy - even though i did not place an expedited order, i received the order extremely quickly. i also like that they plainly indicate their membership with the better business bureau on their check out page. i will definitely be a return customer." patricia g. - pennsylvania"the items were as advertised and delivered quickly. i would order from beltoutlet.com again." juan m. - washington dc"i have been buying from beltoutlet.com for several years. i am very happy with their products and their speedy shipping." john f. - washington"happy with the choice of fanny packs. purchase was without a hitch." albert m. - massachusetts"this merchant offers 2 spectacular fanny packs in buttery soft leather with a myriad of pocket compartments to keep the things that are too bulky for trouser or coat pockets and things that would stack one on top of another in a pocket book or backpack. all pockets have smoothly operating zippers and some have mesh compartments for even more organization. the design is practical and the craftsmanship is beyond criticism. it would still be a tremendous value if it were priced even higher. the merchant maintains a person-friendly simple-to-understand website with plain and straightforward ordering capability. the merchant is very fair with postage and handling and ships immediately. my fanny pack arrived within in a couple of days. the packaging is consistently professional. i would grade this merchant with an a in every aspect of online buying. to put it another way, if you are considering purchasing your fanny pack elsewhere, it won't be nearly as good in terms of functionality and high quality and likely will never last as long for what you will have paid. for a couple of bucks more you don't have to compromise and you can get the best!" john h. - connecticut"had to return a belt and replace it with another. no problems and fast refund. great place." robert c. - new jersey"great products at great prices. leather goods too! you will be able to find unique gifts and items that you didn't know existed. fantastic leather wallets, gloves, belts, and gifts for men and women. i have been a satisfied customer for 5 years." thomas b. - south dakota"the suspenders are high quality and just what i wanted. they arrived very quickly, actually sooner than i expected." berge b. - california"it was my first time ordering from this company. i ordered a few items as christmas gifts sometime in beginning of december. one of the items arrived in the wrong color. i emailed them immediately, and almost as quickly, i received a response with an apology and a promise that the correct color would arrive asap. it felt like the next day, but maybe it was 2 days later, the correct item arrived with a pre-paid shipping label to return the incorrect item. everything arrived in plenty of time for christmas and i would definitely order from here again." caryn m. - new york"beltoutlet.com was exactly what i needed. a huge selection of belts with quick and efficient shipping. i will definitely be visiting again once i wear these out!" spencer c. - iowa"this is my second review of beltoutlet.com that i am pleased to give since i had two orders within 2 weeks of each other. the service was great and the quality of the products was excellent plus the shipping was super fast. many thanks to beltoutlet.com. you are the best!" victoria t. - oregon"great experience. the wallet insert i wanted was out of stock, and i could find no other place on the internet that carried it. beltoutlet.com had an option for me to sign up to receive notice when it was in stock again. i did, knowing that i was probably wasting my time, as i rarely hear back from merchants in these situations. much to my (pleasant) surprise, i received an e-mail from beltoutlet.com about 2 weeks later informing me the item was back in stock! i ordered it right away and it arrived a few days later. highly recommended
