this shipping method does not offer a tracking number and can take up to 4 weeks for delivery.in addition, ups standard ground to canada service is available for shipments for which timely delivery is important or where a tracking number is desired. beltoutlet has partnered with ups to reduce charges associated with importing items to canada by securing a flat brokerage fee for ups deliveries to canadian customers. in addition, you can choose to pay these brokerage fees in advance directly to ups (beltoutlet cannot accept these payments). read the language below for more details.ups brokerage to canada information/disclosurecanada customs requires canadian recipients to pay applicable duties and taxes on each shipment entering canada.these charges may include pst, gst, hst,duties and other taxes of goods (e.g. excise tax). a brokerage fee is also charged to process shipments and present the requisite customs paperwork to canada customs on the importer's behalf.if shipped via ups, your
