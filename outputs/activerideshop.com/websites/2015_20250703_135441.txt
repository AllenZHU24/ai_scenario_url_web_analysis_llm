shop active ride shop strives to support skateboarding in all communities that we reside in and to be the number one destination for all you’re skateboard needs. since 1989, we’ve been committed to providing southern california with the best skate product selection and shopping experience possible. we accomplish this through our many california retail locations and our employees, who actually use and are constantly trained on the products we carry. this empowers all active employees to be your personal product experts when you shop at our stores. we started in 1989 at a small store in chino, california. through hard work and dedication to our customers, we’ve been able to expand the active ride shop experience throughout southern and central california. we take these same

from slim to loose, with a slew of colors and washes that give you mad style on and off the skateboard. active r/s has become so popular and gained so much support within the industry, that we are proud to say we are one of the first skate shops to sponsor a professional skateboarder solely under the shop’s clothing line. we’d like to announce that justin “figgy” figueroa now has his own flannel and denim line under active r/s and will be in an active ride shop location near you soon. industry support active ride shop has pushed the boundaries of what a local skate shop can be. as a result of our success, we have earned the continued support of the world’s top skateboarders and snowboarders including, guy mariano, jamie thomas, justin figueroa, bryan fox, austin smith, keegan valaika and many more. if you plan to visit california, make sure to visit one of our active ride shop locations. our stores offer a wide range of snow, surf, and skateboard goods to suit your
