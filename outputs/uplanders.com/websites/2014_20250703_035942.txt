shipping costs vary depending on the weight of your order and where it is being shipped. they are calculated when you place your order and are available for review during the check-out process. what shipping service does uplanders warehouse use? our primary shipping partner is usps and our standard shipping method is priority mail. we also offer expedited (overnight, 2-day) options through fedex as well. we also feature usps shipping for international orders. how long will it take to get my order? in-stock items ship within 1 business days of the receipt of your order. some items ship from our drop-ship warehouse, so several boxes may come from different warehouses over a period of days. delivery time through our standard/ground delivery service will vary depending upon your location, but please allow 5-9 business days after we ship for receipt of your merchandise. is the uplanders warehouse price for ammunition for a box or a case of ammo? the ammo prices shown are "per box". the number of boxes in a case is indicated on the product page for those who prefer to order only case quantities. order just the amount that you need as there generally are no discounts for case quantities. can i place a back order if a product is out of stock? for regularly stocked items we do take back orders. however, we do not take back orders for products that are one-time special purchases. those products where we allow back-orders will have a special note on their page. click the "add to cart" button on the product page to place a back order. the product order will be cancelled if we can't ship the product within 30 days. your credit card will not be billed for a back-ordered item until it ships. do i need a special license to buy from uplanders warehouse? no. however, since some of the products we offer are intended for adult use, buyers must be at least 21 to purchase them. a waiver and age statement may be required to purchase some items such as ammunition. what forms of payment does uplanders warehouse accept? we accept amex, discover, mastercard, visa and paypal. can i pay by check? yes, though the process will take considerably longer than credit card payment. if you place your order by phone, you may mail a check to us for payment. we will hold your order until the check is received, deposited and cleared by the bank. once your check clears, your order will be released and shipped to you. please note: checks returned unpaid by your financial institution are subject to a service charge of $25. how do i know if uplanders warehouse has received my order? after you complete your purchase, you will receive a page that confirms your order was accepted and will show your web order number. you will also receive an email from uplanders warehouse confirming your order. please be sure that the email address you provide is accurate when placing your order. can i see when my order was shipped? you can check the status of your shipment by logging into your "my account" section and selecting the "order status" link. if we have already shipped your order, the page will display the date shipped along with the package tracking number. if you recently placed an order, but do not see tracking information for your order, it has likely not been processed or entered into the usps system. please wait 24 hours and check again. can i add to an order once it's been submitted? it depends on how quick you call us. we pride ourselves on fast shipping, so there's a chance we've already packaged and shipped your order. but call us and we'll let you know. if you happen to call immediately after the order is placed, we may be able to catch it and edit the order. however, if the order has been processed, you will need to place a separate order for the additional items you would like. does uplanders warehouse ship internationally? we do ship many of our products internationally, but some are restricted (ammunition, etc.). if you are an international customer, please send us an email to inquire if the items you are interested in can ship internationally. how do i return items? most items we sell fall under our 100% satisfaction guarantee. if you're not happy with your purchase for whatever reason, send it back to us for an exchange or refund. the only exception to this guarantee is ammo. for liability reasons, we cannot accept returns on ammo for exchange or refund. for non-ammo returns or exchanges, please package them up with all original packaging materials and tags and ship them back to us at the address below. please include a note or copy of your original receipt that shows your order number, and instruction on how you would like to handle your return (exchange or refund): uplanders warehouse 25026 mills pass ct katy, tx 77494 how do i contact customer service for information regarding an order?
