contact us home / how to put on your compression stockings how to put on your compression stockings compression hosiery, by necessity, is more difficult to put on than regular hosiery. to ease application... • apply your stockings when feet and legs are completely dry. • a dusting of talc to the feet and legs will help. • to prevent runs if your hands or nails are rough or if you are wearing sharp jewelry, wear latex or cotton gloves. follow these steps for easiest application: 1. put one hand inside stocking foot. 2. hold stocking top with other hand, pull down, turning stocking inside-out. 3. remove hand, leaving stocking inside out. 4. stretch stocking sideways at heel and slide your foot into the stocking's foot – up to the heel. be sure to center your heel in the stocking's heel. 5. grasp stocking top. pull up and over the ankle. with a "back and forth" twisting motion, continue working the stocking up the leg. 6. make sure heel and toe are properly aligned. toes should not be cramped. the heavier knit change area in the stocking's ankle should be located over the ankle bone's rotation area. 7. smooth the stocking as you work up the leg – removing wrinkles as you go, especially wrinkles over the instep and around the ankle. to remove: hold stocking top and "peel down" the leg and off the foot, leaving the stocking inside-out subscribe to sign up for exclusive sales ames walker about us customer support catalog leg health our promise coupon policy current deals testimonials privacy shipping returns mail/fax order form contact us site map shop compression therapy diabetic active & athletic shoes plus size hosiery upsurge maternity travel lymphedema braces & supports lounge doctor brands ames walker jobst juzo medi (mediven) sigvaris therafirm venosan shop all brands secure payment all transactions are secure. © 2016 ames walker international × estimate shipping close × email a friend × × estimate shipping close warning: you will not be able to place an order or use most features of this site with javascript disabled
