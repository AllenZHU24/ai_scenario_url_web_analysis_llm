"their advice, direction & always being available in a pinch, have helped make us the largest chocolate fountain rental company in north florida"... "we've been using chocoley chocolate for over 3 years and couldn't be happier, you couldn't pay us to go elsewhere. the product is fantastic, no question about it, but the level of service is incredible, second to none! my wife began researching chocolate suppliers almost four years ago in preparation of our expansion into chocolate fountain rentals, after talking to about 1/2 a dozen suppliers steve & traci leffer stood out. their willingness to take time & educate us not only about fountain chocolate but about fountains as well was absolutely priceless. after spending a couple of hours speaking to us over about 5 phone calls, we were sold. steve's knowledge of fountain chocolate was only half of the package, his years of experience working with the best fountains made him the total package. his advice, direction, & always being available in a pinch have helped make us the largest chocolate fountain rental company in north florida. chocoley is what small business is all about, putting the customer first and than some!!!" matt & rosemary richardson, www.rollinritas.com, jacksonville, fl “i just wanted to let you know i have been using your chocolate and making candies to give away. (hopefully i will be able to start selling soon.) i can’t believe the compliments i am getting on the candy. oh, also by the way, my polycarbonate mold is working great now. anyway i have made candies for at least 50 different people and they all are saying it is the best chocolate they have ever tasted. i am getting ready to place another order soon. i took some candy to some of our friends at our local casino, she passed them around at the steak house and the response from them was just unbelievable, the two managers came up to my table and they both were just going on and on about how it was the best chocolate they had ever tasted. they want me to make up a box so they can give to marketing and want me to start selling it in their gift shop. all the waiters and waitresses even stopped by to pay their compliments. then my other friend i gave a box to wants me to sell at a local craft fair this fall. i am so excited about this. thanks so much for the great chocolate and the great cream centers and the great customer service!” sharon schoenman, williamstown, ky it’s fast and easy to become a wholesale customer click here to access our wholesale application we will immediately email you wholesale pricing upon the approval of your application. would you like to be contacted when training programs will be available. allergen statement - about tempering - candy making chocolate - candy making tools equipment & supplies - chocolate 101 - chocolate candy making guide chocolate candy making kits - chocolate fountain & fondue - contact us - frequently asked questions - gifts - gift certificates - home ingredients and nutrion facts - kosher product information - peanut free chocolate - privacy statement - recipes - return policy - satisfaction guarantee shipping transit times - sitemap - specials - terms of use statement - testimonials - view cart - which chocolate - wholesale - why chocoley we take precautions, including use of sophisticated encryption and authentication tools, to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. website copyright ©2006-2009 chocoley fountain photo copyright ©2006-2009 south van events, lexington, ky
