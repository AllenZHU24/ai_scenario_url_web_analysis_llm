" we've been using chocoley chocolate for over 3 years and couldn't be happier, you couldn't pay us to go elsewhere. the product is fantastic, no question about it, but the level of service is incredible, second to none! my wife began researching chocolate suppliers almost four years ago in preparation of our expansion into chocolate fountain rentals, after talking to about 1/2 a dozen suppliers steve & traci leffer stood out. their willingness to take time & educate us not only about fountain chocolate but about fountains as well was absolutely priceless. after spending a couple of hours speaking to us over about 5 phone calls, we were sold. steve's knowledge of fountain chocolate was only half of the package, his years of experience working with the best fountains made him the total package. his advice, direction, & always being available in a pinch have helped make us the largest chocolate fountain rental company in north florida. chocoley is what small business is all about, putting the customer first and than some!!!" matt & rosemary richardson, www.rollinritas.com, jacksonville, fl “i just wanted to let you know i have been using your chocolate and making candies to give away.
