no tempering required "dear chocoley, i have been making the same cashew/raisin clusters to give as christmas gifts for the last 30 christmases. this past year, my local candy store in durham, nc went out of business. i got on the internet and found you. i had a nice conversation with steve as to which product might work for me. he suggested bada bing bada boom candy melts. i ordered on monday, received 10 lbs of dark on thursday and had clusters ready for the office luncheon on friday. what a hit! i have tried many different kinds of chocolate over the years and yours beats them all! there is just no comparison. melted beautifully and comes out just as shiny as the fancy cashew clusters at the mall. you know the ones. but never mind how beautiful, they are more delicious than any i have ever made. thank you for making my gifts such a success." barbara a. paradise, chapel hill, nc "i make toffee every christmas and i was in a panic when i found the chocolate shop where i usually buy my chocolate closed. what to do? i went to a local craft store but was not impressed with their selection of chocolates for candy making. i searched the internet and came across chocoley’s website. i must admit i was a little hesitant about ordering a food product -- especially for my world famous toffee -- off an internet site. the order arrived very quickly and most importantly, the bada bing bada boom candy melts tasted amazing! what a relief to find such a great product. people actually put themselves in a sugar coma eating the toffee ... it's that good! i will continue to be a loyal customer and have passed on your name to other friends who enjoy baking. thanks -- you provide a great service and product." barb hering, lombard, il "i wanted to tell you how much i love your chocoley bada bing! as i told you on the phone before my first order, i had tried all kinds of chocolate and coatings. when i received bada bing i couldn't wait to see if it worked as well as you told me. and, guess what? it did! this product is fantastically easy to work with. but, the decision to use this product exclusively was finalized when i tasted bada bing with my bourbon concoction. all i can say is wow! what a lovely compliment! and the drizzle and design saves me a lot of time and effort and give me the look i want. i've also fell in love with my infrared laser thermometer too - my life is so much cleaner and easier! thank you so much for recommending this to me! as a new customer i sincerely appreciated the time and effort you took with me on the phone. that meant more than i can tell you. i know that you understood the problems i faced and you gave excellent suggestions. feel free to give anyone that might want a testimonial to give me a call or drop me an email. i'm proof that they do not have to continue the search to find an excellent product once they found chocoley." kindest regards, barbara dunn, owner, bluegrass bourbon balls, louisville, ky allergen statement - about tempering - candy making chocolate - candy making tools equipment & supplies - chocolate 101 - chocolate candy making guide chocolate candy making kits - chocolate fountain & fondue - contact us - frequently asked questions - gifts - gift certificates - home ingredients and nutrion facts - kosher product information - peanut free chocolate - privacy statement - recipes - return policy - satisfaction guarantee shipping transit times - sitemap - specials - terms of use statement - testimonials - view cart - which chocolate - wholesale - why chocoley we take precautions, including use of sophisticated encryption and authentication tools, to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. website copyright ©2006-2011 chocoley fountain photo copyright ©2006-2011 south van events, lexington, ky
