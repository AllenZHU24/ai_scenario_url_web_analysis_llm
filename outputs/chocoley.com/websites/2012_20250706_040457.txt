fountain & fondue chocolate. needless to say, they preferred chocoley over the sephra/callebaut fountain chocolate. a couple of weeks later, in august 2004, at the cater source/event source trade show held in washington, dc. nicole conducted a blind taste test. predictably, the results were staggering - 80% of the catering and event professionals preferred chocoley over sephra/callebaut. nicole and i weren’t astounded. we thought the same thing when we received the samples from our belgian manufacturer. it reminded us of when we were once content with hershey’s candy bars and then had the opportunity to eat fine chocolates. anyway, here we were, little chocoley beating the tar out of the largest chocolate manufacturer on the planet, barry callebaut. of course, for a mass produced chocolate, callebaut was good. but, we wanted better than good – we wanted the very best, and we certainly did not want a mass produced chocolate. whether real chocolate or compound, chocoley is in a completely different class than the overwhelming majority of raw chocolate ingredients available nationwide (whether through the web, catalogs, etc.), and especially compared with mass produced grocery store chocolate products. don’t let well known brand names fool you. just because a company has been around for a hundred years and they’ve advertised that they have "the very best chocolate," doesn’t make it true. quality is quality, and cheap is cheap. the difference in our chocolate is not just the ingredients but that the chocolate is produced in relatively small batches (in comparison to other brands we’ve been able to research) and is therefore produced with far superior quality control from batch to batch. because of this, the chocoley indulgence line is an "artisan" chocolate. it’s like comparing your mother’s homemade "secret" recipe using fresh ingredients and the special way she makes that fantastic dish, that no one else can seem to reproduce or even come close to duplicating. preparing chocolate creations can be fun and simple, or you can express your creativity and talent and make it an art. chocoley is happy to assist those interested in pursuing this wonderful craft by offering not only chocolate ingredients, but a full line of chocolate candy making tools, equipment, supplies, kits, molds and tempering equipment. chocoley has six distinct lines of chocolate, each offering 2 to 5 flavors, all produced in thin disk (wafer) form for easy melting. each line is formulated differently so that we can provide a chocolate for every use. as you’ll discover, each of our specialty chocolates can be used for multiple applications. combining two different types and/or flavors of chocolate is a fun and delicious way to experiment for ultimate results in your creation. please use our descriptions simply as a starting point, but we encourage you to be creative and adventurous. allergen statement - about tempering - candy making chocolate - candy making tools equipment & supplies - chocolate 101 - chocolate candy making guide chocolate candy making kits - chocolate fountain & fondue - contact us - frequently asked questions - gifts - gift certificates - home ingredients and nutrion facts - kosher product information - peanut free chocolate - privacy statement - recipes - return policy - satisfaction guarantee shipping transit times - sitemap - specials - terms of use statement - testimonials - view cart - which chocolate - wholesale - why chocoley we take precautions, including use of sophisticated encryption and authentication tools, to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. website copyright ©2006-2012 chocoley fountain photo copyright ©2006-2012 south van events, lexington, ky
