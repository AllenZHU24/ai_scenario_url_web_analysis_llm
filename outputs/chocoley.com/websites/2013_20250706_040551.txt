(yeah, we couldn’t think of anything either!) you can set up a recurring order to ship to you weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly.  both retail and wholesale customers are eligible to set up recurring orders. how it works: 1. create or login to your chocoley.com account (top right corner of the site). 2. go shopping on chocoley.com, just like normal and fill your cart with everything you want to include in your recurring order.   all chocolate, caramel, ingredients, edibles items and consumable supplies (candy cups, foils, bags, skewers, etc) are eligible to be included in your recurring order.  tools, molds, equipment and other items that are not “consumed” or depleted are not eligible. 3. make sure your order only contains items you want to ship every time, not just this order. 4. if your order contains chocolate items that need to ship cold in hot weather, add the required number of insulated cold-pack shippers to your order (one per 30 lbs of chocolate).   your recurring order will be charged half of the normal cold-pack price ($3.47 instead of $6.95) on each order, and your recurring order will ship cold year round anytime the weather makes it necessary in order to protect your chocolate from melting –even if that’s more than half of the time.   (if your recurring order contains any chocolate items other than just melt it! packed in tubs and drizzle & design we highly recommend you add a cold-pack). 5. once you’re happy with all of the items in your cart, proceed to checkout. 6. if everything in your order is eligible to be in a recurring order you will see a section at checkout (below your address information) to set up your recurring order.  select your order frequency from the dropdown menu under recurring orders. 7. click the checkbox to agree to make this a recurring order. 8. continue to checkout. 9. sit back, relax and let your chocoley start showing up on your doorstep, automatically!  your first order will ship immediately. notes about recurring orders: you can manage your recurring orders under the “my account” tab here you can: edit the items in your recurring order. change the frequency of your recurring order. edit your recurring order payment information. cancel a recurring order. payment methods we accept all major credit cards for recurring orders.  unfortunately for these orders we cannot accept paypal. recurring orders faq can i have multiple recurring orders at the same time? sure!if you need items at different frequencies you can set up multiple recurring orders. you can also set up multiple recurring orders shipping to different addresses (great for businesses with multiple locations, and gifts!).  just run each one as a separate initial order. what about sales/discounts/coupons and recurring orders? how does that work? you will be charged the same amount every time if you place a recurring order unless or until you edit it. this means that if you use a coupon code on your first order that gives you a discount,  or an item is on sale, you will pay the discounted price every time your recurring order is processed. if you have a discount code that includes any free or bonus items, the bonus items will only ship with your initial order. if you update your recurring order with new items or information, the pricing on your entire recurring order will become the current price for all items at the time you amend your order. am i locked in at the price i pay on my first order, every time-- or will the price ever increase? you will be charged the same amount every time if you place a recurring order unless or until you edit it.  if you update the your recurring order with new items or information, the pricing for everything will become the current price for all items at that time. we promise to honor the pricing you pay on your initial recurring order for 6 months from the time that it is first placed (unless you change the items in it which will automatically reset it to current pricing).  after six months, we reserve the right to amend pricing on any items if our costs on those items have increased.  in the event this occurs, we will contact you with the option to approve the new pricing or cancel/change your recurring order. everything to make perfect gourmet chocolate creations products recipes & resources search recipes resources blog gifts why chocoley testimonials loyalty rewards recurring orders santa's workshop wholesale program chocolate shop by type gourmet compound chocolate couverture & ultra couverture chocolate fountain & fondue chocolate shop by product line bada bing bada boom candy & molding formula bada bing bada boom dipping & coating formula drizzle & design chocolate just melt it! fountain & fondue chocolate v125 indulgence couverture chocolate indulgence ultra couverture dipping & enrobing chocolate fair trade organic couverture chocolate white chocolate with coloring sets shop by viscosity (thickness) high viscosity (thicker formulas) low viscosity (thinner formulas) shop by flavor dark milk white shop by what you want to make bark cake pops chocolate dipped caramel apples chocolate covered strawberries chocolate covered bananas chocolate fountain dipped items with a thick coating of chocolate dipped items with a thin coating of chocolate fondue chocolate fudge ganache molded chocolate candy truffle coating turtles/clusters chocoley chocolate is safe for food allergies all chocoley chocolate is peanut free, tree nut free, egg free and celiac safe get more allergy information is it 78° or warmer where your chocolate is shipping?
