fanatics is a privately owned sports merchandise company headquartered in jacksonville, florida, offering the largest selection of officially licensed team and league products found anywhere on the web. what began as two people with a passion for football has evolved into a team of employees fanatical about all sports and dedicated to bringing that excitement to other fans while providing the best shopping experience possible. our beginning when it was announced the jaguars would plant roots in jacksonville, florida, two football loving, anxious brothers got together and opened fanatics in 1995 as a retail shop out of a small room in the back of a mall. although jaguars gear was selling very well, the brothers recognized there was an even greater need for displaced fans around the world to buy merchandise to support their favorite teams. thus, we made our first online retail sale in 1997. business got crazy after that and with the boom of the e-commerce era, the brothers realized they needed to shift focus to online and hired help for the retail stores. (running through the mall with merchandise in a shopping cart in order to quickly ship to customers just wasn't cutting it!) today, those two founding brothers still work in our headquarters which is located in jacksonville, florida, and there are now two retail stores in local malls, along with a fulfillment center for online business. why shop with us? at fanatics we measure our business success in personal relationships, not transactions. we pride ourselves on offering not only the largest selection of top quality products from the best brands, but also the best customer service experience, shipping and return policies in the industry. our customer service professionals are committed to your satisfaction and view each time you contact us as a chance to build a relationship. we're shoppers too and dedicated to delivering to our customers the kind of shopping experience we would want to have. if your expectations are not exceeded and if you don't look forward to coming back, then we haven't done our job! $4.99 flat rate, 3-business day shipping we don't feel you should be punished with higher shipping fees based on your total order value. no matter how many items you purchase, you will enjoy one low rate for shipping. we proudly offer flat rate, 3-business day shipping for only $4.99 per order, as well as other low cost, expedited shipping options. 365-day hassle free returns our top priority is to provide the best service possible and if you don't love what you ordered, we don't want you to keep it. if for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return the item(s) in original condition for a full refund or exchange. unconditional satisfaction guarantee our guarantee is backed with $10 fan cash™ (merchandise credit) for use toward future purchases. if we don't exceed your expectations, we want to know in order to help us improve your shopping experience. endless assortment with over 140,000 officially licensed items from over 600 teams across multiple leagues, you'll find everything you need for all sports, not just football, all in one convenience place. we carry top quality merchandise from the best brands in sports fan gear such as nike, adidas, and reebok, among others. fanatics rewards club as a member of our free club, you will receive 10% back in fan cash™ on every purchase for use toward future purchases with us and free shipping on all orders over $75. shop with confidence protecting your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. we use state-of-the-art encryption technology (ssl) to protect your credit card/personal information. your information is 100% safe when you shop with us. you will never be liable for any unauthorized charges and we will never share your information with outside sources. we sometimes email you to alert you of special sales or new arrivals, but you are free to opt-out of these messages with one click. need more info? view our privacy and security policies. account informationorder statusmy account   |   sign outview cartworry free shoppingsafe shopping privacy policyfanatics experiencesite mapcustomer servicefaqshelpshippingreturnscall: 1-877-827-8965size chartinformation about us affiliate program gift cards fanatics rewards club corporate info careers follow usfacebooktwitteryoutubejoin us on google+we are fanatics © 2011 fanatics, llc. all rights reserved. no portion of this site may be reproduced or duplicated without the express permission of fanatics, llc.
