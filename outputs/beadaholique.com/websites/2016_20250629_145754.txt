we've got a treat for you this week -- the first half of the videos becky nunn shot for us during her visit late last year are now available to watch. the nunn design founder brought a whole box of fascinating projects and innovative mixed media tips and tricks to show, and you can now see her latest instructional videos on our website! in this newest batch of videos, becky demonstrates how to use colorized resin in an open frame hoop (and how to use this technique to create pendants), how to use excess colorized resin pieces to create mosaic pendants (my personal favorite technique -- so creative!), and how to create a shadow-box pendant with resin. next friday we'll have even more of becky's videos up, so get inspired and stay tuned!

"satisfying our growing desire to rejuvenate and revitalize, greenery symbolizes the reconnection we seek with nature, one another and a larger purpose," according to pantone. this earthy color will be easy to incorporate into jewelry designs when spring rolls around, but why wait? you can get started using this hue with help from our greenery pinterest board, which showcases beads, cord, findings and inspirational projects featuring a similar shade of green. see what you can dream up using the dyed jade gemstone beads shown above, or the gleaming czech crystal cup chain (maybe something like our pretty piper earrings, featuring a vibrant green tassel). for in-depth color-pairing suggestions, visit pantone's color of the year report. let us know what you think of the 2017 color of the year in the comments below! this entry was posted in inspirations, trends and tagged greenery, color of the year, pantone, fashion, color trends on thursday, december 29, 2016 by rachel zaimont. 1-3 of 3 page: 1 2 3 4 5 ... 305 next welcome welcome to strung out, the official beadaholique blog maintained by our team of in-house jewelry designers! learn more about our designers » tip: browsing the main page and want to leave a comment? click on the pink title link for the blog entry you want to comment on; its comment box will be at the bottom! categories select category artist profiles beading table wednesday behind the scenes brands contests & giveaways designers facebook live events find out friday holiday inspirations oldblog products projects tips and tricks trends search search archives select month january 2017 (2) december 2016 (13) november 2016 (8) october 2016 (3) september 2016 (4) august 2016 (4) july 2016 (10) june 2016 (3) may 2016 (5) april 2016 (4) march 2016 (14) february 2016 (10) january 2016 (8) december 2015 (21) november 2015 (8) october 2015 (13) september 2015 (16) august 2015 (21) july 2015 (21) june 2015 (24) may 2015 (20) april 2015 (22) march 2015 (16) february 2015 (14) january 2015 (8) december 2014 (18) november 2014 (13) october 2014 (7) september 2014 (9) august 2014 (12) july 2014 (9) june 2014 (12) may 2014 (6) april 2014 (20) march 2014 (10) february 2014 (10) january 2014 (8) december 2013 (16) november 2013 (12) october 2013 (8) september 2013 (13) august 2013 (14) july 2013 (17) june 2013 (11) may 2013 (10) april 2013 (8) march 2013 (15) february 2013 (14) january 2013 (8) december 2012 (20) november 2012 (10) october 2012 (13) september 2012 (11) august 2012 (13) july 2012 (13) june 2012 (14) may 2012 (15) april 2012 (10) march 2012 (17) february 2012 (19) january 2012 (11) december 2011 (16) november 2011 (14) october 2011 (13) september 2011 (15) august 2011 (18) july 2011 (15) june 2011 (15) may 2011 (18) april 2011 (4) march 2011 (4) february 2011 (2) december 2010 (2) november 2010 (2) october 2010 (3) september 2010 (7) august 2010 (27) recent posts new becky nunn videos available! join our next facebook live class -- memory wire tips and tricks, plus a giveaway! pantone's 2017 color of the year: greenery congratulations to the winners of our 12 giveaways of christmas! ended: giveaway #12: swarovski crystal newsletter sign up for our newsletter: join us, for news, updates, special deals, discounts and everything beads. sign up now shop sale & clearance new & trending beads, pendants & charms jewelry making supplies jewelry making tools jewelry making kits gift cards shop by brand learn beading project tutorials instructional videos techniques & guides jewelry making glossary blog as seen in customer service support contact us about us beader's rewards policies sitemap get in touch 1-866-834-4618 service@beadaholique.com follow us facebook twitter you tube pinterest instagram google plus tumblr 1-866-834-4618 follow us facebook twitter you tube pinterest instagram google plus tumblr &copy2017beadaholiqueall rights reservedprivacy questions? feedback? powered by olark live chat software
