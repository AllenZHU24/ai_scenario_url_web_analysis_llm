just had to say again how much i love your tutorials. you are the best because you go at my speed and i learn faster. thank you! - vera b. received my supplies as ordered. thank you for the quick service and well organized website. - cory j. my order has arrived and as always, everything is beautiful. thank you. - peggy g. just wanted to say how your website continually impresses me every day. the videos are amazingly helpful, professional, easy to understand, and pleasant to watch. i've used your live chat twice & received quick, helpful answers to my questions. i'm very new to beading - working on my second project - but i've been to other beading websites and they don't even compare to yours. i felt like "you don't even want my business, do you" when browsing their pages, while yours says "hello, how can we help you, your beading wish is our command." in these days of staying home & being bored out of our minds, you'd think companies would be vying for business instead of repulsing it. glad to have found you. good job, well done! - holly j. hello beadaholique! i received my order today and - again - the quality is exceptional. with every order you exceed my expectations. i may shop sparodically, but i always look to you first for fabulous finds. - lynn b. account & support support center my account wishlists contact us news & sales join the beadaholique newsletter list for new product announcements, exclusive coupon codes, sale alerts and more. email address sign up follow us find us on facebook find us on twitter find us on pinterest find us on instagram find us on youtube find us on e-mail about us search store policies mobile messaging policy privacy policy terms & conditions ca prop 65 accessibility statement covid-19 california consumer privacy act copyright © 2023 beadaholique. added to your cart: subtotal view cart () checkout
