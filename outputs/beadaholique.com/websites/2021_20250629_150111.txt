(i still have that file cabinet in my office today.) i answered customers’ emails and we hired a friend that sat at the kitchen table and counted out bags of beads while sarah created auction listings. the file cabinet became the spare room in her apartment, and soon the entire apartment. we hired more friends and then bought a house which ultimately couldn’t accommodate our growth after only a few more fast paced years. this picture was taken as we moved into our first warehouse in glendale, california. within three years we were again bursting at the seams and broke through the walls to take over a second and then a third adjacent warehouse. now, twenty years later, beadaholique ships thousands of orders each day to beading hobbyists and jewelry makers that find us on multiple marketplaces in 85 countries. many of the friends that helped us as we began are still with us. lidia, who used to clean sarah’s apartment, is now our inventory supervisor who manages her own team. john, who used to do mail, is now the company’s systems manager and programmer. it has been the most personally rewarding experience i have known to work with so many smart, talented and fun people and to see how we’ve grown as individuals as well as a company. we owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of our friends, many of whom have shopped with us since “the early days.” it means the world to us that we can serve you. and it’s still a blast to go to work! facebook | youtube | instagram | twitter | pinterest beadaholique reviews & customer testimonials here are just some of the many comments we've received from our wonderful beaders! just had to say again how much i love your tutorials. you are the best because you go at my speed and i learn faster. thank you! - vera b. received my supplies as ordered. thank you for the quick service and well organized website. - cory j. my order has arrived and as always, everything is beautiful. thank you. - peggy g. just wanted to say how your website continually impresses me every day. the videos are amazingly helpful, professional, easy to understand, and pleasant to watch. i've used your live chat twice & received quick, helpful answers to my questions. i'm very new to beading - working on my second project - but i've been to other beading websites and they don't even compare to yours. i felt like "you don't even want my business, do you" when browsing their pages, while yours says "hello, how can we help you, your beading wish is our command." in these days of staying home & being bored out of our minds, you'd think companies would be vying for business instead of repulsing it. glad to have found you. good job, well done! - holly j. hello beadaholique! i received my order today and - again - the quality is exceptional. with every order you exceed my expectations. i may shop sparodically, but i always look to you first for fabulous finds. - lynn b. account & support support center my account wishlists contact us gift cards new website guide news & sales join the beadaholique newsletter list for new product announcements, exclusive coupon codes, sale alerts and more. email address sign up follow us find us on facebook find us on twitter find us on pinterest find us on instagram find us on youtube find us on e-mail about us search store policies mobile messaging policy privacy policy cookie policy terms & conditions ca prop 65 accessibility statement covid-19 california consumer privacy act copyright © 2021 beadaholique. added to your cart: subtotal view cart () checkout ↑
