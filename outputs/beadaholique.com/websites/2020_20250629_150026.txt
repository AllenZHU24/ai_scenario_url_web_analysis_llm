(i still have that file cabinet in my office today.) i answered customers’ emails and we hired a friend that sat at the kitchen table and counted out bags of beads while sarah created auction listings. the file cabinet became the spare room in her apartment, and soon the entire apartment. we hired more friends and then bought a house which ultimately couldn’t accommodate our growth after only a few more fast paced years. this picture was taken as we moved into our first warehouse in glendale, california. within three years we were again bursting at the seams and broke through the walls to take over a second and then a third adjacent warehouse. now, twenty years later, beadaholique ships thousands of orders each day to beading hobbyists and jewelry makers that find us on multiple marketplaces in 85 countries. many of the friends that helped us as we began are still with us. lidia, who used to clean sarah’s apartment, is now our inventory supervisor who manages her own team. john, who used to do mail, is now the company’s systems manager and programmer. it has been the most personally rewarding experience i have known to work with so many smart, talented and fun people and to see how we’ve grown as individuals as well as a company. we owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of our friends, many of whom have shopped with us since “the early days.” it means the world to us that we can serve you. and it’s still a blast to go to work! facebook | youtube | instagram | twitter | pinterest account & support support center my account wishlists contact us gift cards new website guide news & sales join the beadaholique newsletter list for new product announcements, exclusive coupon codes, sale alerts and more. email address sign up follow us find us on facebook find us on twitter find us on pinterest find us on instagram find us on youtube find us on e-mail about us search as seen in store policies data and privacy policy ca prop 65 accessibility statement covid-19 california consumer privacy act (ccpa) copyright © 2020 beadaholique. added to your cart: subtotal view cart () checkout ↑
