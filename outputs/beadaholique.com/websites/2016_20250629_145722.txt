(i still have that file cabinet in my office today.) i answered customers’ emails and we hired a friend that sat at the kitchen table and counted out bags of beads while sarah created auction listings. the file cabinet became the spare room in her apartment, and soon the entire apartment. we hired more friends and then bought a house which ultimately couldn’t accommodate our growth after only a few fast paced years. this picture was taken as we moved into our first warehouse in glendale, california. within three years we were again bursting at the seams and broke through the walls to take over a second and then a third adjacent warehouse. now, seventeen years later, beadaholique ships thousands of orders each day to beading hobbyists and jewelry makers that find us on multiple marketplaces in 85 countries. many of the friends that helped us as we began are still with us. lidia, who used to clean sarah’s apartment, is now our inventory supervisor who manages her own team. john, who used to do mail, is now the company’s systems manager and programmer. it has been the most personally rewarding experience i have known to work with so many smart, talented and fun people and to see how we’ve grown as individuals as well as a company. we owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of our friends, many of whom have shopped with us since “the early days.” it means the world to us that we can serve you. and it’s still a blast to go to work! newsletter sign up for our newsletter: join us, for news, updates, special deals, discounts and everything beads. sign up now shop sale & clearance new & trending beads, pendants & charms jewelry making supplies jewelry making tools jewelry making kits gift cards shop by brand learn beading project tutorials instructional videos techniques & guides jewelry making glossary blog as seen in customer service support contact us about us beader's rewards policies sitemap get in touch 1-866-834-4618 service@beadaholique.com follow us facebook twitter you tube pinterest instagram google plus tumblr 1-866-834-4618 follow us facebook twitter you tube pinterest instagram google plus tumblr &copy2017beadaholiqueall rights reservedprivacy questions? feedback? powered by olark live chat software
