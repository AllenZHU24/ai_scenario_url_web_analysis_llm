test page for the ssl/tls-aware apache installation on web site hey, it worked ! the ssl/tls-aware apache webserver was successfully installed on this website. if you can see this page, then the people who own this website have just installed the apache web server software and the apache interface to openssl (mod_ssl) successfully. they now have to add content to this directory and replace this placeholder page, or else point the server at their real content. attention! if you are seeing this page instead of the site you expected, please contact the administrator of the site involved. (try sending mail to <webmaster@domain>.) although this site is running the apache software it almost certainly has no other connection to the apache group, so please do not send mail about this site or its contents to the apache authors. if you do, your message will be ignored. the apache online documentation has been included with this distribution. especially also read the mod_ssl user manual carefully. your are allowed to use the images below on your ssl-aware apache web server. thanks for using apache, mod_ssl and openssl!
