account once your order has been fulfilled. for more information, please visit our modsquad rewards page for more information. 250 points = $10500 points = $20750 points = $301000 points = $40 where do i login to view my rewards and tier status? to check the balance of your points and available gifts navigate to the modsquad rewards page. i can’t log into my account! what do i do? no problem! click "forgot password?" to reset your password. from there, you'll need to verify your email address and it will lead you through the process to get you back into your account. if you're having any further issues, please email us at support@modcloth.com and we'll get you sorted! do rewards points expire? your points will expire after one year of inactivity. inactivity includes not interacting with our program i.e., redeeming points, placing an order, etc. we will send you an email to remind you to use your rewards points. is there a limit to the number of reward points i can apply to an order? yes, there are discount brackets as listed below. for more information, please visit our modsquad rewards page for more information. 250 points = $10500 points = $20750 points = $301000 points = $40 how do i use my points to redeem rewards? you can use your points at checkout to redeem products or discounts! you must purchase at least one item in order to redeem points for a product or discount. please note that points can only be redeemed through domestic checkout at this time. international point redemption is coming soon. we apologize for any inconvenience. please feel free to reach out to customer care with any additional questions or concerns**please note that our system only accepts one discount per order, so points and a coupon cannot be applied to the same purchase. checkout dropdown instructions: once logged in and ready to check out, on the right-hand side you'll see a drop-down menu underneath your cart total [above the "gift card or discount code" field]. select the reward you would like to redeem, and click "apply". the page will refresh, and the product will be added to your cart. discounts are not eligible on shipping fees or taxes. if you are not signed in with your rewards account, you will not see this dropdown option at checkout. if after signing in, the drop down is still empty -- please clear your browser's cache and cookies and allow some time to load. can i transfer or merge my points between two separate accounts? unfortunately, you cannot transfer points between two accounts. you can accrue points on 2+ separate accounts (depending on which account/email you're logged in with while shopping), but we recommend only using one account to maximize your points! what happens when i return or cancel an order in which points were earned? if a purchase is made and points were earned through the purchase, the earned points will be refunded back to modcloth.com, even if this makes your points balance negative. what happens when i return an order in which points were applied? if you are returning the entire order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent after the discount was applied. the points you used to redeem the discount will also be added back into your account! if you return part of your order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent after the discount was applied, but your points will not be refunded. please note that loyalty coupons are divided as a per dollar percentage across all items in your order, so more expensive items will receive a larger percentage of the dollar amount off the coupon than a less expensive item. **note that shipping cost is not refunded, and there is a $5 usd return fee for the use of our return label deducted from the refund total. how am i notified of my benefits? with every tier earned, there will be an email notification sent out to the email used to register your modsquad rewards account. do i have to be logged into my account in order to earn points when placing an order? yes. will i receive rewards points for purchases i made before creating my rewards account? you will only receive points for purchases made after creating your rewards account. make sure to create an account before placing an order so you can receive points! how long does my rewards status last? once you are in a modsquad tier, you will be in that tier for one year from the date you unlocked it. make sure to keep interacting with our program to maintain your status (or even move up a tier)! how do i make a referral? to make a referral, you must be logged into your rewards account. you will then be able to input a friend's email to send a referral link. referrals must purchase their items through the direct link provided to them to receive referral benefits. once the order is complete, a notification will be sent. how do i know if i got a referral coupon? referrals must purchase their items through the direct link provided to their email for you to receive referral benefits. an email notification will be sent to you once the referral order is completed. please be sure to check your spam and junk mail folders as emails can go there from time to time. how do i apply a referral discount? to apply a promo code, you must add the items you wish to purchase to your cart. next, enter your code in the “gift card or discount code” box upon checking out. please note we do not allow stacking of coupon codes, so a referral code may need to be removed to take advantage of higher discounts during site wide sales and other special events. **please note that direct referral link is not compatible with paypal or afterpay payment methods. what is a qualifying review? how do i get points for reviewing a product? at this time, only reviews submitted through a post purchase review email as a verified buyer will qualify for receiving loyalty points. due to a system limitation, we are not able to reward points for reviews made through product pages on the website. please note that the review email is set to send 25 days after the purchase date and can sometimes go to the junk or spam folder. can i earn points when i use a gift card to make a purchase? at this time, points can only be earned off of unique dollars spent in our store. while points can be earned for purchasing gift cards, they can not be earned from spending them. account my info modsquad rewards give 20%, get 20% picked for you! new arrivals best sellers plus size sale help shipping & returns sizing guide / size charts customer care faqs
