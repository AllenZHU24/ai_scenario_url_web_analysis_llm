guidelines. these guidelines set forth the requirements with which business partners must comply in order to continue to work with modcloth. pursuant to the california transparency in supply chains act, modcloth discloses as follows.verification modcloth engages a qualified third-party to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery involving business partners which meet certain

they are found and build management systems that prevent problems from reoccurring. by working with business partners in this way, modcloth can improve the lives of people who work for these partners.
