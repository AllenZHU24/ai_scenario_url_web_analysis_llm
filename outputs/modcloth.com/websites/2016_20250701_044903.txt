if an item you love is still listed on the site, but the sizes are greyed out, there’s a good chance we’ll get it back! just click on the “i need it!” button next to your size to let our buying team know you’re waiting for it. depending on the availability of the item with the vendor, we’ll do our best to bring it back in stock! if you see “sorry this item isn't available anymore” when you’re looking at a product, that sadly means we will not be getting that item back in stock. many of the products we carry come from smaller companies and independent artists, and they are a bit more limited on runs. feel free to chat our customer care team and they can find some more information for you! where do you find your clothes? here at modcloth we strive to be a fun, friendly spot for style and decor that’s as expressive and unique as you are! we’ve created our exclusive line of apparel based on and inspired by feedback from our dedicated community. we also carry a curated selection of styles from hundreds of independent designers found all over the world! we carry a variety of things, and all of them come from different places. we love to source our clothes from all over, because it means we can bring you the best and most unique variety. can i use more than one coupon on my order? no, sorry! our system only accepts one coupon at a time and will default to the last coupon entered. coupon codes cannot be combined. why don't i get modcloth emails? we like to keep in touch with our community, so we send our members emails about fun features, contests, and sales, in addition to other news and important order info. we also take care to respond to every customer email that we receive. so, if you've joined modcloth but aren't receiving these emails, or if you're simply having trouble communicating with us, we're sorry! gmail, yahoo!, and hotmail can mistakenly block modcloth messages as spam, and many of our customers who have these addresses don't receive our messages at all. if your address is through one of those providers, this is most likely the reason. but, you can adjust your settings to make sure our emails get to your inbox and not your spam folder. here's how to do it with gmail, hotmail, and yahoo. if that's not the problem, give us a call at 1-888-495-9699, and we'll happily help you over the phone. if you're not a modcloth member, but you'd like to receive our emails, won't you join us? how do i change my email preferences? if you've joined modcloth, you're automatically set to receive emails about our fun features and contests, exclusive opportunities, and first-to-know info, as well as other news and important order info. but, you can also customize the types of messaging you wish to receive. wanna do that? first make sure you're signed in, then click on your name at the top of the page to access your email settings. from there, you can select, adjust, or limit your email preferences as you wish! are modcloth's products manufactured in the united states? we search the globe to bring you the cutest, most unique items from indie designers all over the world, and sometimes, we don't have to look too far! we offer an extensive list of products made right here in the u.s., and we're always looking for more. to check our 'made in the usa' items, click here! do you carry petite, larger, additional, plus, or extended sizes of your clothing? we know not everyone is built the same, and we’ve made it our mission to make sure that all of our customers feel like the best versions of themselves when they wear our clothing. when our buyers fall in love with certain designs that come in petite or larger sizes, we make sure to stock them. we’re constantly looking to increase our assortment of extended sizes, so be sure to check back often to see the newest additions to our collection. to see a list of our current styles in extended sizes,click here! how do you determine if a dress is long, short, or somewhere in-between? for every dress we carry, we determine length by using our own guidelines and taking our own measurements. we pull a size small for each dress and measure it from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the skirt hem. our maxi dresses measure 40+ inches long, or if they're strapless, 32+ inches long. our mini dresses are 31.75 inches long or less, or 24.75 inches long or less if strapless. and our longer length dresses measure between 32 - 39.75 inches long, or 25 - 31.75 inches long if strapless. you can find these length measurements under the 'details' section of the page for that item. that's the long and short of it! if you need some more help with figuring out how this will work on your specific body type, be sure to visit our modstylists. they’ll be able to guide you through the process. my order status says, "pending." what does that mean? 'pending' just means that our system successfully received your order. once the order leaves our fulfillment center, we'll email you a tracking number, and your order status will change to 'shipped.' oh, no - an item i love is out of stock! what can i do? sign up for a restock notification - it's an easy way to find out when sold out items are available for purchase again. if that dress you've fallen in love with is sold out or that lamp you're dying to have is no longer available, just sign up for the restock notification. that way, whenever the item comes back, you'll be the first person to find out! do you ship internationally? yes, we do! in fact, we just started offering a new, lower cost shipping option for all international orders. read all about it on our shipping information page! where's my return? if you used one of our return labels to send your return back to us, it will normally take around 2 weeks to arrive back to us. once delivered to our fulfillment center in pittsburgh, you can expect your return to be processed within 5-7 business days. as soon as we process your return, we’ll send you an email with all of the details inside! in the meantime, you can keep track of your package with the tracking number listed on your return shipping label or right within your modcloth account under “return information”. can i receive a refund for an order that was purchased with store credit? at this time, refunds can only be issued in the same manner in which they were paid. if you placed your order with store credit, you can only receive store credit for that return. if you paid with a credit card or paypal, you may receive the refund to your original form of payment or the store credit applied to your modcloth account. do gift certificate purchases qualify for special offers or promotions? sorry, but gift certificates do not count toward the purchase amount required to be eligible for free shipping or promotional offers. i just placed an order yesterday, and now you're offering a coupon. can i use it on my previous order? if your order was placed in the last 60 minutes, we can absolutely apply the coupon to it! however, we are unable to apply a coupon to an order after 60 minutes have passed due to system limitations. something i just ordered yesterday at full price is now on sale! can i get the sale price? we're more than happy to make that adjustment in the form of store credit, as long as the item was purchased within seven days of the beginning of the sale and the item was full price at the time you purchased it. additionally, we will only honor price adjustments when items are red-lined discounted and found on the sale page. promotions via coupon codes do not qualify for price adjustments as coupons carry no cash value and cannot be refunded. one thing to note, receiving the price difference for your order will make your item non-returnable. if you haven't had a chance to try on your items, you may want to do so before we process the price adjustment. that way, in case they don't fit, you'll still be able to return for a refund! what happens if i return an item that i bought on sale or used a promo code on? coupons and discount codes are allocated across all applicable items. if you applied a coupon or discount code on the order you're returning, or if you are returning an item purchased on sale, you'll be refunded the amount that you paid after the applied discount. what currency are your prices listed in? all of the prices listed on modcloth.com are listed in us dollars. still not sure, or need to know more? call us at 1-888-495-9699, or contact us via email or live chat. we're here to give you a hand! close account my info my loved items wishlists notifications help customer care faq shipping information returns & exchanges modstylists company about us blog careers affiliates press follow us facebook pinterest twitter googleplus instagram youtube site map ca notice privacy & security terms of use copyright ©2002-2017 modcloth.com. all rights reserved. loading... kaboodle polyvore stumbleupon tell a friend ;
