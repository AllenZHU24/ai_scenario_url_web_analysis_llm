affiliate sign up site feedback modcloth » help » faq faq what does final sale mean? if an item is marked "final sale," this means that it cannot be returned or exchanged. store credit or a refund will not be issued for any returned "final sale" items. will you be getting ______ back in stock? for our vintage items, which are one of a kind, we're generally not able to re-stock. however, sometimes we are able to find something similar! our non-vintage items can often be re-ordered, and if we have enough interest we do our best to get more. when you see an item that you'd like that isn't currently in stock, click on the "notify me" link and let us know! where do you find your clothes? all over! we carry a variety of things, and all of them come from different places. for our one-of-a-kind pieces we scour thrift shops, flea markets, garage sales, and estate sales. we order our vintage-inspired items from small, independent designers who fit our style and ideals. we love to source our clothes from all over, because it means we can bring you the best and most unique variety. can i use more than one coupon on my order? no, sorry! our system only accepts the last coupon entered. why don't i get modcloth emails? if you'd like to receive the modcloth newsletter via email for fun contests, exclusive sale previews, product sneak peeks, and more, sign up under the navigation on the left. if you've already signed up for our newsletter and are not receiving it, or if you're simply having trouble communicating with us, we're sorry! we always want to make sure our communication with customers is the best it can be! we take care to answer every customer email that we receive. yahoo! and hotmail frequently block modcloth messages as spam, so many of our customers that have addresses with them don't receive our messages at all. if you have a yahoo! or hotmail address, this is the most likely reason. if not, give us a call at 1-888-495-9699 and we'll happily assist you over the phone. are modcloth's products manufactured in the united states? we search the globe to bring you the cutest, most unique items from indie designers all over the world, and sometimes, we don't have to look too far! we offer an extensive list of products made right here in the u.s., and we're always looking for more. to check our 'made in the usa' items, click here! do you carry petite, larger, additional, plus, or extended sizes of your clothing? we know not everyone is built the same, and we do our best to accommodate all body types at modcloth! when our buyers find great, indie designs that come in petite or larger sizes, we're excited to stock them! to see a list of our current additional sized garments, click here! what makes a dress "longer length" or "mini?" longer length dresses are 35+ inches long, or, if they're strapless, 28+ inches long. mini dresses are 31 inches long or less if not strapless, and 25 inches or less if strapless. you can find these length measurements under the measurements tab on the item's product page. that's the long and the short of it! what is so special about modcloth's shipping materials? today, most retailers incorporate just a ratio eco-friendliness into their shipping methods by settling for a 30/70 split of recycled and new materials. however, we wanted to go completely green — our new kraft-brown boxes are made of 100% post-consumer recycled content! this post-consumer material is unique in that it’s an end product that has completed its life cycle as a consumer item, which would have otherwise have been disposed of as solid waste. in addition to our new packaging, the lovely logo and interior design is printed using waste-free, biodegradable eekoflex ink. unlike petroleum or soy based inks, eekoflex ink can be remade into usable product. here’s to a more colorful, earth-friendly future! my order status says, ‘pending.’ what does that mean? "pending" just means that our system successfully received your order! once the order leaves our fulfillment center, we’ll email you a tracking number, and your order status will change to “shipped.” oh, no! an item i love is out of stock! what can i do? sign up for a notification - it’s an easy way to find out when sold out items have been restocked. if that dress you've fallen in love with is sold out or that lamp you're dying to have is no longer available, just sign up for an email restock notification. that way, whenever the item comes back, you'll be the first person to find out! do you ship internationally? yes, we do! in fact, we just started offering a new, lower cost shipping option for all international orders. read all about it on our shipping information page! why don’t you remove the vintage items once they sell? we keep the vintage items up on the page so that our customers get an idea of what styles and types of items we typically get in for sale. we add new products every day, but they do sell fast! if we removed every vintage item once it was sold, we would have nothing up on the site to show our customers! to find out when our vintage items launch, check out http://twitter.com/modcloth1stlook. where’s my return? returns are usually processed within about 3-5 business days after we receive your package, and we’ll email you as soon as we open it! in the meantime, you can keep track of your package with the tracking number listed on your return shipping label. have a question? fill out our contact us form and we'll get back to you as soon as possible! get modmail enter your email to receive special messages! sign up facebook twitter pinterest flicker polyvore youtube rss join modmobile! our story modcloth on facebook new arrivals clothing shoes bags & accessories apartment be the buyer vintage sale blog my account my info my loved items wishlists notifications about us susan's story life at modcloth careers testimonials press help customer care modstylists faq shipping information returns & exchanges size & fit site feedback copyright © 2002-2012 modcloth.com | all rights reserved. | privacy & security | terms of use|site map loading... facebook twitter kaboodle polyvore stumbleupon tell a friend x an unknown error has occurred there was an unknown error that occurred. it seems that something went wrong. we apologize for the inconvenience! an unknown error has occurred x an unknown error has occurred oops! there was an unknown error that occurred. it seems that something went wrong. we apologize for the inconvenience! an unknown error has occurred x an unknown error has occurred there was an unknown error that occurred. it seems that something went wrong. we apologize for the inconvenience! oops! an unknown error has occurred our guarantee at modcloth, we know what it's like to be a customer. we realize that shopping on the internet can be frustrating, so we work hard to provide you the best possible online shopping experience. popular questions my order status says, 'pending'. what does that mean? oh, no! an item i love is out of stock! what can i do? do you ship internationally? how much will it cost? why don't you remove the vintage items once they sell? where's my return? popular links fit and form details shipping information returns and exchanges gift certificate faq notifications faq still have questions? check out the faq live chat online now! got questions? we've got answers! chat now call us available now! want to talk to someone over the phone?
