often, vintage items come to us without labels or with outdated sizing information. that's why every one of a kind vintage garment sold on modcloth is specifically measured for bust, waist, and hip fit. these dimensions are provided in the "details" section of each product page. dimensions given are in inches and taken flat across the garment. the listed measurements do not include any stretch the item might have, nor do they correspond directly with the item's circumference. while it may seem unconventional to provide each vintage item's specific measurements, it's the most accurate way for us to help you determine fit with one of a kind garments. to best assess your fit, choose a garment that you already own and that fits you well. lay this item flat and measure across the front. then, compare your measurement with your desired garment's "details" information. bust to determine an accurate bust measurement, lay your measuring tool flat across the garment's front, just under the arms. waist the waist measurement included in the "details" of a product's profile provides the garment's natural waist dimension - this is the most narrow part of your mid-section. for a dress' waist measurement, find the narrowest part of the garment (the waist line), and measure it. for pants or a skirt, measure the top of the garment to ascertain its waist. hip measure the widest part of a skirt or pants, below the waistband. length for tops and dresses, measure from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the garment. for pants and skirts, this is the measurement from the waist to the bottom. inseam this is a measurement for pants, and refers to the length from crotch to bottom of pant leg. need a special measurement for a particular item?
