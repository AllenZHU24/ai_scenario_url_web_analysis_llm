all over! we carry a variety of things, and all of them come from different places. for our one-of-a-kind pieces, we scour thrift shops, flea markets, garage sales, and estate sales. we order our vintage-inspired items from small, independent designers who fit our style and ideals. we love to source our clothes from all over, because it means we can bring you the best and most unique variety. why don't you remove the vintage items once they sell? we keep the vintage items up on the page so that our customers get an idea of what styles and types of items we typically get in for sale. we add new products every day, but they do sell fast! if we removed every vintage item once it was sold, we would have nothing up on the site to show our customers! to find out when our vintage items launch, check out http://twitter.com/modcloth1stlook. my order status says, 'pending.' what does that mean? 'pending' just means that our system successfully received your order and we're processing it! once your package leaves our fulfillment center, the order status will change to 'shipped.' we'll email you a tracking number so you can follow its journey, too. have another question about checkout? call us at 1-888-495-9699, or contact us via email or live chat. we're here 24/7 to give you a hand! gift certificates & coupons how do i purchase a gift certificate? it's the simplest, speediest way to send something special. gift certificates are purchased just like any other item in our store, except that they go straight to your inbox instead of your mailbox! we'll email you or your recipient a lovely image file accompanying your personalized message and gift code. read more. how do i redeem a gift certificate?
