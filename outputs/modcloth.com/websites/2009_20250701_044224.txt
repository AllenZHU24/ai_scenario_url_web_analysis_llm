(measuring your body directly may give you misleading measurements.) if you are shopping for skirts or dresses, measure a skirt or dress you already have that fits you well. same for tops, jackets, etc. bust/chest measure from just under the armpit to the armpit on the other side. waist this refers to the natural waist: the thinnest part of your mid-section. so for a dress, the thinnest part is the waistband area. for pants or skirts, this refers to the top of the garment. hip measure the widest part of a skirt or pants, below the waistband. length for tops and dresses, measure from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the garment. for pants and skirts, this is the measurement from the waist to the bottom. inseam this is a measurement for pants, and refers to the length from crotch to bottom of pant leg. need a special measurement for a particular item? call us at: 888-492-9699 or e-mail us now! ease of fit information for outerwear we recommend allowing for at least one inch of ease in the bust when purchasing outerwear. for example, if the flat measurement across the bust of a top that fits you well is 17 inches, you should order a coat with a flat bust measurement of at least 18 inches. the extra inch will allow room for seam thickness, as well as ease of movement. as always, the best method of ensuring proper fit is to measure a garment that already fits you well. the garment should be similar in thickness and/or shape to the piece you are interested in purchasing. you may realize you prefer no ease at all, or two inches instead of one - it all depends on your particular style! winter coat rating outerwear is rated on the following guidelines, with 1 being the most lightweight and 5 being the heaviest: 1 materiallightweight liningunlined sleeveany sleeve length bodyany body length specificsthis jacket is more “fashion” than “function.” this category includes unlined, “hoodie-type" jackets. 2 materiallightweight lininglined sleeveany sleeve length bodyany body length specificsthis category includes light, spring and summer jackets and pieces used for layering. 3 materialmid-weight to heavyweight liningfully-lined, or partially-lined. for example, the body of the garment may be lined, but its sleeves may not be. sleevecropped sleeves or full-length bodyfull or cropped lengths specificsitems in this category are suitable for fall and mild winters. 4 materialmid-weight to heavyweight liningfully-lined sleevefull-length bodyno cropped styles specificsthis outwear is suitable for fall and winter, but may require layering for colder winters. 5 materialheavyweight material, or mid-weight with heavy lining. liningfully-lined sleevefull-length bodyno cropped styles specificsthis category includes our very warmest styles that are suitable for winter in cold regions. in the press about us composition and fit international shoe sizes returns careers find us rss feed facebook myspace twitter kaboodle polyvore products rss copyright © 2002-2009 modcloth.com, all rights reserved | privacy policy support: 1-888-495-9699 | contact | powered by crowd interactive loading... facebook myspace stumbleupon polyvore stylehive kaboodle twitter tell a friend please sign in to view your wishlists rss feed facebook myspace twitter kaboodle polyvore
