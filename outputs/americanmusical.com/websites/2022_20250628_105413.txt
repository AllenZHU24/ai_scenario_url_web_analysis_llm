well, it is if you’re looking for maximum overall volume and low frequency response. and trust us, you will not find a louder unamplified acoustic guitar than the jumbo. gibson created this category in 1937 with the introduction of their j-200 model, featuring an oversized body shape. larger than a dreadnought, the jumbo provides the most bass for the fullest sound available from all body sizes. however, the caveat is that the jumbo can be somewhat less focused than a dreadnought. nylon string nylon string guitars have a wide, flat fretboard and are outfitted with nylon strings for the ultimate in mellow tone. popular for classical and flamenco music with different bracing and tonewoods used for each, a nylon string guitar is the only logical choice if this is the style of music you wish to perform. however, even willie nelson has used a nylon string guitar throughout his entire country, folk, and pop music career. many beginners also choose to learn on a nylon string guitar before switching to a steel string model due to its smaller size and ease of playability. tonewoods just as size and body shape affects the tone, so does the species of wood used in the instrument’s construction. you’ll find backs and sides made of rosewood (balanced and loud with a slow decay), mahogany (a warm, woody, mellow tone), maple (bright, clear tone with pronounced upper-mids with a short decay), and koa (warm tone with a pronounced top-end) — plus tops commonly fabricated from sitka spruce or cedar. solid or laminated? laminated plywood is less expensive to produce and can take a lot of abuse. however, an instrument constructed of solid tonewoods will resonate better and project louder than its laminated counterpart. straddling this divide, you’ll find instruments with laminated back and sides, and solid tops. amplify your sound whether it’s a band situation or a solo gig, an acoustic electric will allow you to plug directly into an acoustic guitar amplifier or pa system and bring your sound to the masses. built-in pickups (and sometimes microphones) faithfully reproduce your sound at a volume that can fill a room and keep up with the bass and drums. check out our acoustic electric guitars page for more information on this category. ready to buy?
