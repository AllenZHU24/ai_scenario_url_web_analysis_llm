"my bud said he'd sell me his 'sweet new guitar' for $325. will you match the price?" ams's price match guarantee is only to match the price on new items offered by authorized u.s. dealers in accordance with their dealer agreements. discontinued items, demos, items out of the box, even from authorized dealers, do not count. they cost less for a reason! but, if you find a great deal somewhere else, we'll try and match it. •   ams doesn't price match dealers outside the u.s. •   ams cannot match a price from a dealer who does not have the product in stock, available, and ready to ship to you. unfortunately, sometimes unscrupulous retailers may advertise a hot product at an unrealistic price without having the product in stock. you could place the order and wait weeks to receive it and end up canceling the order. if you want to wait till the retailer has the product in stock and submit a price match - guarantee form at that time, we'll do our best to match it. •   ams will not offer price protection against other dealers who have advertised "loss leaders." some retailers will try to attract you to buy a product by selling certain products below a reasonable price. based on our information on dealer cost, if another vendor is advertising an item at a price below which we think they can profitably offer all their items, ams cannot offer price protection. if you find a retailer who will sell you a product for less than what they paid for it, you should buy it, but they might not be around for long. •   ams will not take part in bidding wars with other dealers for the opportunity to sell you a "package" of products. we price match, but we don't haggle. we're in the business of selling quality musical instruments and accessories at the lowest prices possible. period. •   price matched products may not be eligible for ams easy pay plan. •   this excludes blowouts, discontinued merchandise, factory seconds, apple products, bose products, korg products, vox products, rivera products, special sales, floor and demo models. price must be printed in a local or national ad by an authorized dealer. products must be new and factory packaged. return to shopping return to help center most popular searches 12 string acoustic guitars - 12 string electric guitar strings - 4 string bass guitar strings - 4 string electric bass guitars - 5 string electric bass guitars - 6 string acoustic electric guitars - 6 string acoustic guitars - 61 key synthesizer - 7 string electric guitar strings - acoustic guitar bags - acoustic guitar cases - acoustic guitar effects - acoustic guitar pickups - acoustic guitar strings - audio compressors - audio enhancers - bass guitar pedals - china cymbals - classical guitar strings - crash cymbals - cymbal packs - digital audio cables our company about us contact us chat for help! privacy policy affiliate program need help? customer service track your order edit your account order a catalog returns policy shipping information why we rock! free shipping easy payments gold lock protection guaranteed lowest price 45 day money back guarantee resources gift certificates weekly giveaways catalog quick order product warranties product manuals all rebates join our community follow us shop: site map see all brands homeguitarsbasslive soundrecordingcomputerwarekeyboarddjdrumaccessories bizrate bizrate circle of excellence price grabber verisign secured american musical supply, one of the world's largest musical instruments and equipment retailers offers our no-hassle/no-interest easy payment plans, free 12-month extended warranty, and a 45-day money back guarantee. ams brings you more than unbeatable deals on a huge inventory of musical instruments and accessories - we offer the best customer benefits in the business! you'll find the greatest selection of electric guitars, guitar effects, guitar amps, pa speakers, studio monitors, audio interfaces, digital pianos and studio gear anywhere. our customer service experts are available to you 24/7 by online chat, email, and phone. check out our exclusive extras: in-depth reviews, tech tips, and more! at ams, we are proud to be a part of the bizrate circle of excellence for customer service and satisfaction. be assured...when you buy musical instruments and equipment from ams, you buy from the best! copyright © 1996-2011 american musical supply, inc. all rights reserved. american musical supply is not responsible for typographical errors in pricing or product specification inaccuracies in our catalog or web site. prices are subject to change without notice. tools tap to call navigate site new day new deal my cart track order my account loading....
