.042. common gauges for electric guitar strings include 9’s (light gauge) or 10’s (medium gauge.) acoustic strings are generally a little thicker to produce more volume. common gauges are 12’s (light gauge) or 13’s (medium gauge.) nylon strings are labeled as “tensions”, light tension, normal tension and hard tension. about the author -
