versatile instrument steeped in tradition! it can be soft and sweet, or it can rock out with the best of them. whether used for fingerpicking some country or bluegrass, or strummed aggressively as the driving force of a rock band, the acoustic guitar is among the most adaptable instruments in music. it’s also one of the most portable, as you can take it from the bedroom to the beach and from the campfire to the concert stage. american musical supply carries trusty acoustic guitar models that are ready and waiting to help you make incredible music day-after-day. this includes martin guitars, taylor guitars, gibson acoustic guitars, breedlove, alvarez, and many more top brands known for their superior craftsmanship, consistency, and playability. there are many styles of acoustic guitars made from many different species of wood, and ams carries them all. not completely sure what size, look, and build is right for you? fear not, because we’re here to walk you through the basics. more price ranges while cruising our acoustic guitar pages, you’ll notice that we have guitars and acoustic guitar packages available for under $100, others priced at several thousands of dollars, plus many more in between. and although it’s true that there are spectacular instruments at the higher end of the spectrum, you’ll still find well-made, great-playing acoustic guitars at the lower end. the difference in price can reflect the species of wood; whether it’s solid or ply; where it’s made; whether there are any hand-made components; additional electronics; and overall fit and finish. size and shape acoustic guitars come in many different sizes and shapes, and there are generally two considerations when choosing a body style — comfort and tone. some of these styles are also available with a cutaway, making it easier to access the highest frets. mini known more for their convenience than their tone, small acoustic guitars or mini guitars are great for grab-and-go situations where something smaller is preferred, or for little ones with smaller hands. mini guitars are usually available in ½ and ¾ scale. there are currently some well-built and very playable models of mini guitars manufactured by name brands such as martin and taylor, among many others. parlor (or parlour) originally popular with folk and blues guitarists from the late 19th century through the 1950s, the parlor guitar is among the smallest of body styles, producing a smaller, punchier mid-range tone. gaining popularity in recent years due to a resurgence in folk-style music, the parlor guitar’s smaller body size is also found to be more comfortable by guitarists of a smaller stature. and like the mini, they’re easy to travel with. 000 auditorium this professional-sized instrument produces a well-balanced tone that’s suitable for live performance or studio recordings. while these guitars are about the same overall size as a dreadnought, their deeper “waist” makes it easier to wrap your arms around and helps the body sit firmly on your lap. this deeper contour also reduces its bass and midrange response as compared to a dreadnought, which many guitarists find complements their particular style. the grand auditorium originally introduced by taylor guitars, the grand auditorium is a larger version of the smaller auditorium size, producing a bit more bass response and projection than a 000. and due to its larger body style, it is also similar in tonal quality to a larger dreadnought. the grand auditorium has a balanced and clear bell-like tone that’s perfect for strumming or fingerstyle playing. om or orchestra model c.f. martin created this category in 1929 by fulfilling a special order for popular band leader perry bechtel. perry wanted a steel string guitar with a narrower, longer neck that would sonically cut through the other instruments in his ensemble. based on their largest body size available at the time (the 000), and sized just below the standard dreadnought, the om offers strong projection and a wide frequency range with a more standard fret scale, rounded bouts and a deeper waist. dreadnought when you envision an acoustic guitar, chances are you’re picturing a dreadnought, by far the most popular size and shape. and once again, c.f. martin was responsible for creating this category. named for a battleship (the hms dreadnought) due to its larger physical and sonic size, this model produces more volume and a well-balanced tone throughout the bass, mid, and treble ranges. as such, the dreadnought is suitable for almost any style of music and is at home in the studio or on the stage. the jumbo bigger is better, right? well, it is if you’re looking for maximum overall volume and low frequency response. and trust us, you will not find a louder unamplified acoustic guitar than the jumbo. gibson created this category in 1937 with the introduction of their j-200 model, featuring an oversized body shape. larger than a dreadnought, the jumbo provides the most bass for the fullest sound available from all body sizes. however, the caveat is that the jumbo can be somewhat less focused than a dreadnought. nylon string nylon string guitars have a wide, flat fretboard and are outfitted with nylon strings for the ultimate in mellow tone. popular for classical and flamenco music with different bracing and tonewoods used for each, a nylon string guitar is the only logical choice if this is the style of music you wish to perform. however, even willie nelson has used a nylon string guitar throughout his entire country, folk, and pop music career. many beginners also choose to learn on a nylon string guitar before switching to a steel string model due to its smaller size and ease of playability. tonewoods just as size and body shape affects the tone, so does the species of wood used in the instrument’s construction. you’ll find backs and sides made of rosewood (balanced and loud with a slow decay), mahogany (a warm, woody, mellow tone), maple (bright, clear tone with pronounced upper-mids with a short decay), and koa (warm tone with a pronounced top-end) — plus tops commonly fabricated from sitka spruce or cedar. solid or laminated? laminated plywood is less expensive to produce and can take a lot of abuse. however, an instrument constructed of solid tonewoods will resonate better and project louder than its laminated counterpart. straddling this divide, you’ll find instruments with laminated back and sides, and solid tops. amplify your sound whether it’s a band situation or a solo gig, an acoustic electric will allow you to plug directly into an acoustic guitar amplifier or pa system and bring your sound to the masses. built-in pickups (and sometimes microphones) faithfully reproduce your sound at a volume that can fill a room and keep up with the bass and drums. check out our acoustic electric guitars page for more information on this category. ready to buy? regardless of your preferred music genre or
