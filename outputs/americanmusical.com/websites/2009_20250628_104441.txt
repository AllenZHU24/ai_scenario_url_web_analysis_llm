"my bud said he'd sell me his "sweet new guitar" for $325. will you match the price?" ams's price match guarantee is only to match the price on new items offered by authorized u.s. dealers in accordance with their dealer agreements. discontinued items, demos, items out of the box, even from authorized dealers, do not count. they cost less for a reason! but, if you find a great deal somewhere else, we'll try and match it. ams will not beat prices from dealers outside the us. ams cannot match a price from a dealer who does not have the product in stock, available, and ready to ship to you. unfortunately, sometimes unscrupulous retailers may advertise a hot product at an unrealistic price without having the product in stock. you could place the order and wait weeks to receive it and end up canceling the order. if you want to wait till the retailer has the product in stock and submit a lowest price match form at that time, we'll do our best to match it. ams will not offer price protection against other dealers who have advertised "loss leaders." some retailers will try to attract you to buy a product by selling certain products below a reasonable price. based on our information on dealer cost, if another vendor is advertising an item at a price below which we think they can profitably offer all their items, ams cannot offer price protection. if you find a retailer who will sell you a product for less than what they paid for it, you should buy it, but they might not be around for long. ams will not take part in bidding wars with other dealers for the opportunity to sell you a "package" of products. we price match, but we don't haggle. we're in the business of selling quality musical instruments and accessories at the lowest prices possible. period. any products for which you receive an ams price match are not eligible for the ams easy pay program. this excludes blowouts, discontinued merchandise, factory seconds, apple products, bose products, special sales, floor and demo models. price must be printed in a local or national ad by an authorized dealer. products must be new and factory packaged. return to shopping return to help center copyright â© 1996-2010 american musical supply, inc. all rights reserved. american musical supply is not responsible for typographical errors in pricing or product specification inaccuracies in our catalog or web site. prices are subject to change without notice. homeguitarsbasslive soundrecordingcomputerwarekeyboarddjdrumaccessories site links | site map | help? | catalog quick order | weekly giveaways | gift certificates | email this page | affiliate program | privacy policy | about us as one of the world's largest musical instruments and equipment retailers, american musical supply offers you more than unbeatable deals on a huge inventory of musical instruments and accessories - we offer the best customer benefits in the business! you'll find the greatest selection of electric guitars, guitar effects, guitar amps, pa speakers, studio monitors, audio interfaces, digital pianos and studio gear anywhere. our customer service experts are available to you 24/7 by online chat, email, and phone. ams makes your musical instruments and equipment purchase an easy choice with free shipping on many items, price matching, free 12-month extended warranty, a 45-day money back guarantee, and our no-hassle/no-interest easy payment plans. check out our exclusive extras: in-depth reviews, tech tips, and more! at ams, we are proud to be a part of the bizrate circle of excellence for customer service and satisfaction. be assured...when you buy musical instruments and equipment from ams, you buy from the best!
