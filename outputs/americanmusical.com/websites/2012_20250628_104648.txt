thanks! how are shipping charges handled? if you are returning a product for an exchange, ams will pay the shipping charges on the exchange order. if you are returning a product for a refund, ams will refund the full purchase price excluding any shipping charges incurred on the original order. however, you are responsible for the shipping costs on the product that you are returning to ams. we do not credit any original shipping charges toward the exchange. if the return is needed as a result of damage, defect, or our mistake, ams will pay the shipping charges - both to have your item sent back to ams, and to send you a replacement item. ams can issue a factory-fresh product in advance (pending approval). these exceptions are at the sole discretion of american musical supply and its returns department. how are restocking fees handled? we rarely charge restocking fees. we can only accept items that are returned without signs of wear and tear and with all of the original contents and packaging. “wear and tear” refers to any damage that was not present when the merchandise was received - rack mounting damage, scratches, dents, etc. “contents” consist of any included parts and accessories, as well as the warranty card and manual, void of notes or markings. packaging includes all inner and outer packaging, complete with the original barcode affixed. items not returned in the condition described here may be subject to restocking fees (minimum 15% of the purchase price, as determined by our cost of replacing the missing items including a processing fee for this labor-intensive process) or refusal of the return. larger items and items that we ship directly from our vendors can be subject to a minimum 30% restocking fee. this fee may apply if you refuse delivery or as a result of delivery exceptions, as well as from a typical return. these conditions apply to all returns regardless of the reason for the return. a restocking fee will be charged for any defective item that is returned in damaged condition. how long does it take to receive a refund? once our warehouse receives the returned merchandise, a refund is typically processed within 1 to 2 business days (monday through friday). processing time may vary depending on daily return volume. processing time may exceed 3 business days during january (typically our busiest month) and other times during the year when we are exceptionally busy. return to shopping return to help center our company need help? why we rock!
