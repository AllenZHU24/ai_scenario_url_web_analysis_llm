thanks! how are shipping charges handled? if you are returning a product for an exchange, ams will pay the shipping charges on the exchange order. if you are returning a product for a refund, ams will refund the full purchase price excluding any shipping charges incurred on the original order. however, you are responsible for the shipping costs on the product that you are returning to ams. we do not credit any original shipping charges toward the exchange. if the return is needed as a result of damage, defect, or our mistake, ams will pay the shipping charges - both to have your item sent back to ams, and to send you a replacement item. ams can issue a factory-fresh product in advance (pending approval). these exceptions are at the sole discretion of american musical supply and its returns department. how are restocking fees handled? we rarely charge restocking fees. we can only accept items that are returned without signs of wear and tear and with all of the original contents and packaging. "wear and tear" refers to any damage that was not present when the merchandise was received - rack mounting damage, scratches, dents, etc. "contents" consist of any included parts and accessories, as well as the warranty card and manual, void of notes or markings. packaging includes all inner and outer packaging, complete with the original barcode affixed. items not returned in the condition described here may be subject to restocking fees (minimum 15% of the purchase price, as determined by our cost of replacing the missing items including a processing fee for this labor-intensive process) or refusal of the return. larger items and items that we ship directly from our vendors can be subject to a minimum 30% restocking fee. this fee may apply if you refuse delivery or as a result of delivery exceptions, as well as from a typical return. these conditions apply to all returns regardless of the reason for the return. a restocking fee will be charged for any defective item that is returned in damaged condition. how long does it take to receive a refund? once our warehouse receives the returned merchandise, the return is typically processed within 3 to 5 business days (monday through friday). processing time may vary depending on daily return volume. processing time may exceed 5 business days during january (typically our busiest month) and other times during the year when we are exceptionally busy. 45-day money back guarantee protected 12 months extra for free! product warranties product manuals product condition get it fixed or serviced getting started payment information security & privacy online store info how to order why we rock upload your image customer review setting up your wish list site map pay methods easy payment plans sales tax gift cards/certificates lowest price guarantee secure shopping policy privacy policy contact us chat for help! order a catalog glossary rebates institutional purchase orders our company about us contact us chat for help! privacy policy affiliate program need help? customer service track your order edit your account order a catalog returns policy shipping information why we rock! free shipping easy payments gold lock protection guaranteed lowest price 45 day money back guarantee resources gift certificates weekly giveaways catalog quick order product warranties product manuals all rebates join our community follow us shop: site map see all brands homeguitarsbasslive soundrecordingcomputerwarekeyboarddjdrumaccessories bizrate bizrate circle of excellence price grabber verisign secured american musical supply, one of the world's largest musical instruments and equipment retailers offers our no-hassle/no-interest easy payment plans, free 12-month extended warranty, and a 45-day money back guarantee. ams brings you more than unbeatable deals on a huge inventory of musical instruments and accessories - we offer the best customer benefits in the business! you'll find the greatest selection of electric guitars, guitar effects, guitar amps, pa speakers, studio monitors, audio interfaces, digital pianos and studio gear anywhere. our customer service experts are available to you 24/7 by online chat, email, and phone. check out our exclusive extras: in-depth reviews, tech tips, and more! at ams, we are proud to be a part of the bizrate circle of excellence for customer service and satisfaction. be assured...when you buy musical instruments and equipment from ams, you buy from the best! copyright © 1996-2011 american musical supply, inc. all rights reserved. american musical supply is not responsible for typographical errors in pricing or product specification inaccuracies in our catalog or web site. prices are subject to change without notice. tools tap to call navigate site new day new deal my cart track order my account loading....
