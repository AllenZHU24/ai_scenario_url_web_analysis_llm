"iâm calling it a moral victory at least. we had a really fun weekend." smithâs buoyant outlook at least partially stems from having been joined at the track by his brother jeff and longtime friend wayne kintz. the two shared the role of crew chief in a tag team approach that leveraged their combined thirty years of experience in arca racing. although jeff smith has been involved with bradâs racing career from the beginning, heâs been unable to participate for most of this year. said jeff: "bradâs got a lot of new and younger guys on his team this time around and needed wayne and i to show them the ropes. basically, they just need to learn from people that have done it âjust like we did. having come up from the back at talladega and again today, the team is getting a real boost in spirits." persons interested in pit crew positions on the team (detroit area residents only) should send an email to brad smith (brad@bradsmithmotorsports.com). arca series brings brothers together again at toledo -- driver brad smith joined by his brother jeff as crew chief may 2010 corydon, indiana â brad smith, driver of appliancezone.com racingâs #26 ford in the arca series, will see a familiar face in the pit when his brother jeff assumes the role as crew chief during the menard 200/ federated car care race starting 2:00 p.m. this sunday at toledo speedway. the two brothers, both raised and still living in the romeo, michigan, area, have been involved in racing since youngsters âtheir father was a racing enthusiast and, briefly, a driver as well. "my dad was a backyard mechanic that always had a passion for cars and he planted the seed for me and jeff," smith said. "we were too young to watch him race but attended many events with him at the old mt. clemens race track and got to see a number of the legendary michigan drivers like benny parsons, joy fair, ray neece, irv baumgarten and others." although the two brothers collaborated in arca racing for many years, in recent years jeff had other obligations that kept him from attending. the toledo race is therefore a family reunion of sorts at the track âfans may get a glimpse of the "raw intensity" between the two siblings in a sport both pursue with great passion. "jeff is a very knowledgeable crew chief and a great fabricator," said smith of his brother. "he also has a very good understanding of racing from a business perspective and is also calm under pressure and able to think quickly on his feet. â when heâs at the track he is the anchor of the team and iâm able to trust him completely with the car." smithâs sponsor, appliancezone.com racing, is glad the two brothers will be working together again.
