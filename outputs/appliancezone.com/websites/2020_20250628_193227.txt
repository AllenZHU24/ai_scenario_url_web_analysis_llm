we are open and still shipping. however, due to the high volume of orders during this outbreak, our shipping carriers may experience delays from unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances that we are unable to control. as stated in our unforeseen & unavoidable circumstances and carrier shipping delays policies below, we are not responsible for these delays and cannot provide refunds for delayed shipments. however, we guarantee we are doing everything we can to get your orders out as soon as possible. please have patience as we work through this, together. shipping policy once an order is placed at appliancezone.com, it is set to an "awaiting fulfillment" status as we begin sourcing the oem item(s) directly from manufacturer vendors. the order will remain in "awaiting fulfillment" status until the item(s) arrive and the order is shipped from our facility. once shipped, notification of the shipment and tracking information is emailed to the customer. due to our sourcing process we are unable to cancel orders once they have been placed. on occasion, there are extenuating circumstances, such as a manufacturer back-order, when we may be able to make an exception. since appliance zone sources oem parts directly from manufacturer vendors, we cannot offer expedited shipping. however, we do offer free standard shipping on all orders. on average, orders placed with us will arrive in 4-10 business days (monday through friday, not including holidays or weekends). if you have not received your order after the tenth business day, please contact us for further information on your order. we ship via all major mail carriers, including ups, fedex, and the united states postal service. the carrier chosen for individual orders is based on the location and delivery time of your order and cannot be chosen by customers. on the occasion that an unforeseen delay occurs we will work with you to see that the order arrives as soon as possible. it is important to note that although some carriers may operate on weekend days, we cannot guarantee movement of any order on these days, nor holidays, and therefore do not count them as applicable shipping days. you can, however, sign up to receive movement notifications. click for more info on setting up shipping notifications. additional policies customer billing & shipping addressesit is the customer’s responsibility to enter the correct information at checkout for billing and shipping address information. we greatly encourage customers to carefully check that the information entered is correct and accurate prior to submitting their order. once the order has been submitted we are unable to change address information and will ship to whatever address has been submitted. the customer is also responsible for checking and confirming the accuracy of their browser's auto-fill settings, as well as any information being submitted through a third party service, such as paypal, g pay, amazon pay, or apple pay, prior to submitting their order. in the event that an order is returned due to an incorrect address, the customer is responsible for the incurred shipping charges, which will be deducted from the amount refunded/credited for the returned part(s). in addition, the customer would need to place a new order with the correct address, if they are still interested in purchasing the part(s). shipping surcharges & oversized itemssome orders may require additional shipping & handling fees due to contents, size or product/services. also, orders shipped to more remote areas may incur additional costs. if shipping charges are more expensive than indicated on your web order, you will be contacted by phone or by email informing you of additional fees or duties that may be required to ship your package. if this is the case the customer retains the right to cancel their order. furthermore appliancezone.com reserves the right to cancel any order at any time that requires any additional shipping charges from the carrier. please note: we will not charge you any additional freight without your authorization. customs duties and taxesorders that are shipped to countries outside of the u.s. may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country ("import fees"). the recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. customs policies vary widely from country to country; therefore we recommend that you contact your local customs office for further information. when customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates. to obtain details regarding the actual import fees, or to obtain documentation or receipts in connection with customs clearance, you may contact the designated carrier specified in your shipment confirmation e-mail. unforeseen & unavoidable circumstanceswe cannot predict unforeseen circumstances such as weather delays, power outages or other things often referred to as “acts of god.” although these delays may prevent your order from arriving on time, they are out of our reasonable control. in those cases we will work with you and the shipping carrier to be sure you get your package as soon as possible, however our normal shipping and delivery guarantees don’t apply. carrier shipping delaysalthough we strive to make sure all of our orders arrive within or before their estimated delivery date, occasionally there are carrier delays that are beyond our control. sometimes when shipping an order we discover that none of our carriers can deliver the order within the customer selected time frame. additionally, some carriers no longer guarantee their delivery times, which unfortunately means we cannot guarantee that orders will arrive within the estimated timeline and cannot refund customers for orders that the carrier failed to deliver by the estimated delivery date. however, we do guarantee that we are doing everything we can to get all orders out of the door as soon as possible to allow our carriers ample time to deliver the orders within the estimated shipping timeline. in the event, at the time of shipment, that none of our carriers can deliver the order within the customer selected time frame, we will ship the order under whichever option will deliver the order closest to the chosen time frame. cancellation policyonce an order is placed, it is automatically sent to processing. we do this so we can ship your order as soon as possible. unfortunately, this means that we are unable to cancel an order after it has been submitted. we apologize for this inconvenience, and encourage you to speak with us if you have any questions or concerns prior to placing an order. unreceived, incorrect, & damaged ordersin the event that your order is not received by the estimated tracking date, or has arrived with damaged, incorrect, or missing pieces please notify customer service within (3) days of receipt or of the projected arrival date. if we do not notate your account of the issue within (3) days we cannot guarantee that we will be able to offer you a replacement order. please note that we are not authorized to offer refunds under these circumstances, as it is our policy to replace the missing/problem items in these situations. usps damagesif your order has been damaged in shipment by usps (united states postal service) usps requires you (the addressee) contact/take the damaged item and packaging to your local post office to submit a claim for refund. they will have to print a ps-2856 form, to file a 'damage report of insured article and contents'. once printed the ps-2856 form will need completed and mailed/faxed to the st. louis, mo post office for review. once
