once an order is placed at appliancezone.com, it is set to "awaiting fulfillment" status as we begin sourcing the oem item(s) directly from manufacturer vendors. the order will remain in "awaiting fulfillment" status until the item(s) arrive and the order is shipped from our facility. the entire process of sourcing your parts, receiving them, and then shipping them out can take up to 10 business days. once the order has shipped your order status will change to a "shipped" status. if it has been more than 10 business days and your order status is still "awaiting fulfillment", it's likely that one or more of your parts is on backorder with the manufacturer. typically, manufacturer backorders are nationwide meaning that the item(s) are likely out of stock everywhere. in these situations, we put the item(s) on order, to reserve it for you. that way, once the part is available, your order has priority and is fulfilled before others who may have purchased the item after you. if it has been more than 10 business days and your order is still "awaiting fulfillment", you can complete an order status request form to get more information on your order. my tracking shows delivered, but i have not received my order yet if your tracking details show the package was delivered and you cannot locate it, we recommend waiting 48 hours following delivery confirmation as some tracking displays a delivered status prior to their arrival at the destination. if it has been more than 48 hours following the delivery confirmation: look for a notice of attempted delivery left by the carrier. look around the delivery location for your package (on the porch, by your garage etc.) see if someone else in your household or a neighbor accepted the delivery. verify the shipping address used by the carrier and on your order was correct. some packages travel through multiple carriers, double-check your mailbox or wherever you normally receive mail. my order has shipped, but seems to be held up if your tracking details show that the package has not moved after a couple business days, it can appear that your order has been held up in shipment. however, there are steps you can take to determine if your order is actually held up or if the tracking has not successfully updated. select the carrier of your order below to see what steps you can take to locate your order. find my usps shipment find my fedex shipment i received my order damaged / missing pieces we're sorry that this happened. we understand how inconvenient it can be to have an appliance out of comission, and will work with you to get this resolved as soon as possible! please be aware that if you received a damaged order, you must contact us within 3 days of receipt in order to claim a damaged order. we also will need pictures of the damage, including any damage to the packaging to verify and claim the damage with the carrier. once we have verified the missing or damaged pieces, we will issue a replacement. it is our policy to send replacements for missing or damaged parts. we do not offer refunds in these situations. if you ordered multiple parts or a kit, please be aware that we will only replace the items that are missing/damaged and not the entire order. i understand and would like to claim a damaged or missing  part. i believe my part is defective we're sorry that you're having problems with your part. please be aware that we will need your complete appliance model and serial number in order to review a warranty claim. we require this information because we have found that most of the time a part will go bad because the wrong part was installed to begin with. so, we must check to make sure this is not the case before we can proceed with the claim. once the claim has been submitted we will review and respond to your claim via email. click here to review our limited warranty policy and complete a warranty claim. i need a different part if you would like to return your part and/or get a different part, click here to review the policy and complete the return application. about our products product questions × ok subscribe to our newsletter get the latest updates on new products and upcoming sales email address navigate info returns contact us blog sitemap info appliance zone llc 1203 highway 62 ne corydon, in 47112 © 2020 appliance zone llc |   sitemap   |   terms & conditions   |   privacy policy   |   shipping policy   |   return policy   |   refund policy   |   warranty policy
