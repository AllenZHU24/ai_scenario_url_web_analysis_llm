orders are returned back to us by the shipping company due to an incomplete or incorrect address entered when the order was placed. this can often be caused by making a mistake or typo when placing the order or by not entering the apartment or unit number of the address. in these cases we require that a $5.00 fee be paid by the customer before the order can be reshipped to the correct address. cancellation policyonce an order is placed, it is automatically sent to processing. we do this so we can ship your order as soon as possible. unfortunately, this means that we are unable to cancel an order after it has been submitted. we are only able to cancel an order if it is backordered with the supplier/manufacturer. we apologize for this inconvenience, and encourage you to speak with us if you have any questions or concerns prior to placing an order. refund/return policy:customers have 90 days from the date of receiving the part to contact us for a return. once we have been contacted, we will issue the return authorization. the return authorization will need to be included with the return for proper credit processing. we recommend that customers get a tracking number from the carrier they have chosen to return the part. once the part is delivered to our receiving department most refunds are issued within a few days. however, depending on the bank’s policy it may take up to two weeks for them to post the credit to your account. if it has been three weeks since we received your shipment and you still have not received credit, please contact us for further information. *as long as we receive this return in the original packing, the part(s) is unused and not installed we will be able to process the refund. if we do receive the part(s) used, installed or without original packaging we will not be able to process the refund. installed and used parts will be disposed of immediately and we will not be able to get these back from the warehouse. all electrical parts that are returned are inspected by technicians for signs of installation on the parts. return authorizationpart(s) may not be returned without the return authorization. appliance zone has the right to refuse any unauthorized package. any parts returned without obtaining a return authorization will be charged a 50% restocking fee. an unauthorized package is any part return that has not been given an ra number or any part found to have been previously installed/used. unauthorized packages may be refused at the warehouse and returned to the sender. customers may incur the cost of shipping the unauthorized package back to the sender. for items cancelled or returned due to reasons other than an error on our part, the actual cost of shipping will be deducted from the refund and appliance zone is not responsible for return postage. parts in non-oem packaging will be declined for a refund. used & installed partsfor the purposes of this policy, electrical parts are considered installed when the wires and or harnesses are attached. electrical parts that have been plugged-in but have not had power applied to them are still classified as having been installed and do not qualify for return.

attached. damaged & missing itemsif your order was damaged or is missing an item(s), please notify customer service within 10 days of receiving your order. if we do not notate your account with 10

an in store credit. however, we are not authorized to offer a refund. unforeseen & unavoidable circumstances we cannot predict unforeseen circumstances such as weather delays, power outages or other things often referred to as “acts of god.” although these delays may prevent your order from arriving on time, they are out of our reasonable control. in those cases we will work with you and the
