there are so many companies out there who accept electrical part returns, why shouldn’t we do it too? were you aware that those companies resell the returned parts to other consumers? we can guarantee you that the companies that are allowing these returns are then in turn selling these parts back to the public because it would be to costly for them to dispose of them so what else can they do but to resell them. so when you see this –“return any part for any reason”- beware because ultimately you may be the one buying that part. appliancezone.com has a strict duty to you, the consumer, to not sell you any electrical or gas parts that has been used and or installed. we estimate that approximately 80% of part return requests on electrical parts are parts that have been installed and after doing so the customer discovered that they had misdiagnosed the problem and replaced the wrong part. if we allowed customers to return electrical or gas products then we would of course in turn have to resell them and this would create a situation in which our customers are receiving used parts that other customers have used, perhaps while misdiagnosing a problem with their appliance and in which the part could have been damaged and or the life of the part shortened because of improper diagnosis or installation. this is not fair to our customers and we can not in good faith resell these parts. if we allow these items to be returned we are then not able to guarantee to you, our customers, that we are selling you new genuine factory parts. if we allowed returns on electrical parts that have been installed we would in fact be hurting our customers because they are receiving parts that may now be damaged and that would defiantly be void of a manufacturer warranty. so out of respect for you, and others like you, we cannot accept electrical or gas parts returned for a refund. but however if you purchase a part that is not for your model we will exchange it for you for the correct like part, an example would be a timer exchanged for a timer, but only if the part has not been used or installed. it is only fair that way. the allenbar : appliance technicians you're going to love this tool! march 2004 i designed this for my own personal use when i was an appliance service technician. around 2002 i was changing a motor in a whirlpool dryer and i was having a hard time getting the last motor clip fastened down, generally most service guys use a flat blade screwdriver to do this, anyways the screwdriver slipped off the clip and there went my left hand right across the motor mount resulting in several stitches. afterwards i called my parts supplier up and asked our sales rep if he could locate a tool that would help prevent this sort of thing from happening again. after checking with whirlpool, maytag, frigidaire, and ge he was unable to locate any kind of tool that could be used specifically for changing dryer motors. so i decided then to make something up for myself to use, after a few attempts i finally found a design i was happy with. i carried this around in my tool box for about a year when i decided that since it worked so well i would try my hand at selling it to other service technicians such as myself. after several thousands of dollars in design, packaging, logo's, advertising, and of course...lawyers, my product hit the shelves nationwide of most major appliance parts distributors in 2004. to date about twenty thousand have been sold worldwide but most right here in the good ole usa! it was definitely a trying experience and i'm glad my wife and kids pushed me to follow through with it because there were definitely times i wanted to abandon the project. it won't ever bring millions but if this handy tool can save a few appliance technicians knuckles from being busted up or fingers sliced, then i guess its worth it! most appliance distributors carry the allenbar nationwide. after searching for a tool specifically designed for removing retainer clips, and coming up dry, jim was determined to make his own. jim allen perfected his invention and named it the allenbar. buy it here! sign up now for the latest info on new products, newsletters, and specials! © appliancezone® terms & conditions website suggestions home | find parts | contact us | helpzone | about | | sign in whirlpool parts | maytag parts | ge parts | amana parts | bosch parts | kitchenaid parts | jenn-air parts | dacor parts | magic chef parts | frigidaire parts | hotpoint parts | dishwasher parts dryer parts | microwave parts | refrigerator parts | stove oven range parts | washer parts
