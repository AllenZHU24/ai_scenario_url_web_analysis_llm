stones can come out during cleaning (small ones are especially prone to this), in which case you have averted a loss by proactively maintaining the jewelry in a controlled way. insurance for many customers protecting their fine jewelry investment with a personal jewelry insurance policy makes sense and gives great peace of mind. while whiteflash does not sell insurance, we do recommend jewelers mutual insurance co., a leading specialist in the field. their policies are all-risk, covering theft, loss and damage. our clients can get quotes and apply for coverage conveniently through a link on our website. whiteflash is a full manufacturing jeweler and can perform any service you may need to maintain or repair your fine jewelry. if we can be of assistance please call us toll free at 877-612-6770. continue shopping at whiteflash.com search diamonds view rings see jewelry view gallery shopping cart (3) 1. your ring $3,628.00 remove move to your ring 0move to your ring 2add to wishlist $2,575.00 remove move to your ring 0move to your ring 2add to wishlist total: $6,203.00 2. your ring + add diamond $495.00 remove move to your ring 0move to your ring 1add to wishlist shape any shapes round princess cushion emerald radiant asscher pear marquise oval heart trillion spring cut european cut old miner flanders kite star carat - color d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z - d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z clarity if vvs1 vvs2 vs1 vs2 si1 si2 si3 - if vvs1 vvs2 vs1 vs2 si1 si2 si3 cut ideal excellent verygood good fair - ideal excellent verygood good fair price - search find your ring size solitaire settings three stone settings diamond settings designer rings wedding sets design your ring whiteflash gallery request design wedding bands diamond earrings diamond pendants diamond bracelets right hand rings men's jewelry whiteflash design anniversary jewelry news diamond education whiteflash books promotions wallpapers the perfect fit enter amount: select country australia canada singapore united kingdom alberta british colombia manitoba new brunswick newfoundland northwest territory nova scotia nunavut ontario prince edward island quebec saskatchewan yukon sub total: duty: shipping: total: calculate ? rings diamonds jewelry wedding engagement rings solitaire wedding bands diamond rings wedding sets verragio follow us sign up for our newsletter: whiteflash news dreams of africa blog whiteflash rating : 5rating based on 3153 reviews. read all testimonials contact us give us feedback if you have suggestions regarding whiteflash.com site, please, fill form below and click "send". your name your e-mail send thanks for your feedback. we appreciate your help in improving whiteflash website. close info@whiteflash.com telephone 1-877-612-6770 outside usa 1-832-252-6770 2150 town square place suite 330 sugar land, tx 77479 usa winner of the 2012 bbb pinnacle award best jeweler in houston, texas mobile version © 2000-2012 whiteflash - a brilliant diamond buying experience ® privacy policies sitemap what would you like to do? buy this diamond without setting – you can still add the diamond to a setting later if you decide to do so. buy this diamond with setting. search from our selection of diamond settings to find your perfect ring. what would you like to do? buy this diamond pair without setting – you can still add the diamond pair to a setting later if you decide to do so. buy this diamond pair with earrings. search our selection for studs and earrings to find the perfect match for your diamonds. what would you like to do? buy setting now without diamond. you can add a diamond to this setting later. buy diamond with this setting. choose from our selection of loose diamonds to create your ideal engagement ring. what would you like to do? buy earrings now without diamond. you can add a diamond to these earrings later. buy these earrings with our diamonds. choose from our selection of loose diamonds to create your gorgeous earrings.
