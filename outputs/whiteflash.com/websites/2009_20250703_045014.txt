as a material is very light and extremely durable although it is not indestructible. in particular, titanium is used in a number of industries including the military, aerospace and sporting goods. as a result, titanium jewelryis highly resistant to corrosion and scratching. tungsten: tungsten is a very heavy and hard metal for its size (4x harder than titanium) but can scratch easily. tungsten will hold its shine and shape longer than any other jewelry available on the market.  a downfall of this metal is that it can not be re-sized so make sure that you get your finger size before ordering! sterling silver pure silver is a fairly soft metal and is mixed with other metals, usually copper, to attain greater hardness and durability for use in jewerly and flatware. sterling silver contains 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% alloy. sterling silver is often expressed and stamped as .925. silver is the most reflective of all metals. for this reason it is used as the backing for mirrors. it's ability to take a very high polish and its malleability and durability make it a great metal for jewelry making. it's relative availability compared to gold and platinum make it an affordable precious metal. sterling silver has a tendency to oxidize in air, causing it to darken. to look it's best it needs to be polished from time to time in order to retain its luster. polishing clothes are available that with gentle rubbing can quickly remove the oxidation and restore a bright finish. sealers are also used on some silver products to provide tarnish resistance. about us whiteflash is the first company in the u.s. to specialize in the coveted hearts & arrows diamond and bring the sheer beauty of âsuper ideal cutâ to the internet. debi wexler, a computer entrepreneur founded whiteflash in 2000 bringing an expansive selection of loose diamonds to the internet, including an exclusive brand of hearts & arrows. a cut above (aca®) is unmatched in its brilliance, fire and sparkle and remains the only hearts & arrows diamond sold online with advertised standards and a âtrue patterningâ guarantee. in addition, whiteflash offers original handcrafted platinum and gold settings, diamond engagement rings and wedding bands, custom designed engagement rings and diamond jewelry. whiteflash articles
