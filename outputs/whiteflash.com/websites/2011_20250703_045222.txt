stones can come out during cleaning (small ones are especially prone to this), in which case you have averted a loss by proactively maintaining the jewelry in a controlled way. insurance for many customers protecting their fine jewelry investment with a personal jewelry insurance policy makes sense and gives great peace of mind. while whiteflash does not sell insurance, we do recommend jewelers mutual insurance co., a leading specialist in the field. their policies are all-risk, covering theft, loss and damage. our clients can get quotes and apply for coverage conveniently through a link on our website. whiteflash is a full manufacturing jeweler and can perform any service you may need to maintain or repair your fine jewelry. if we can be of assistance please call us toll free at 877-612-6770. continue shopping at whiteflash.com search diamonds view rings see jewelry view gallery shape any shapes round princess cushion emerald radiant asscher pear marquise oval heart trillion spring cut european cut old miner flanders kite star carat - color d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z - d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z clarity if vvs1 vvs2 vs1 vs2 si1 si2 si3 - if vvs1 vvs2 vs1 vs2 si1 si2 si3 cut ideal excellent verygood good fair - ideal excellent verygood good fair price - search solitaire settings three stone settings diamond settings wedding sets design your ring whiteflash gallery request design wedding bands diamond earrings diamond pendants diamond bracelets right hand rings men's jewelry whiteflash design anniversary jewelry news diamond education whiteflash books wallpapers vatche rings diamonds design jewelry garnet dreams of africa wedding ring celebrity earrings ring size engagement rings solitaire prong bezel settings champagne eternity halo lotus micro pave v prong solitaire rings mens jewelry wedding bands follow us subscribe sign up for our newsletter: whiteflash news dreams of africa blog contact us info@whiteflash.com telephone1-877-612-6770 outside usa1-832-252-6770 6222 richmond ave. suite 700 houston, tx 77057 usa give us feedback if you have suggestions regarding whiteflash.com site, please, fill form below and click "send". your name your e-mail send thanks for your feedback. we appreciate your help in improving whiteflash website. close © 2000-2011 whiteflash - a brilliant diamond buying experience ® privacy policies resourcessitemap what would you like to do? buy this diamond without setting – you can still add the diamond to a setting later if you decide to do so. buy this diamond with setting. search from our selection of diamond settings to find your perfect ring. * register with whiteflash to receive better prices and discounts what would you like to do? buy setting now without diamond. you can add a diamond to this setting later. buy diamond with this setting. choose from our selection of loose diamonds to create your ideal engagement ring. what would you like to do? buy earrings now without diamond. you can add a diamond to these earrings later. buy these earrings with our diamonds. choose from our selection of loose diamonds to create your gorgeous earrings.
