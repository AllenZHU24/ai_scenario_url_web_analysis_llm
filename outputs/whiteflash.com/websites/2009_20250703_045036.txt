"majorca pearls" are an example of a high-end imitation or simulated pearl, also known as a "faux pearl". about us whiteflash is the first company in the u.s. to specialize in the coveted hearts & arrows diamond and bring the sheer beauty of âsuper ideal cutâ to the internet. debi wexler, a computer entrepreneur founded whiteflash in 2000 bringing an expansive selection of loose diamonds to the internet, including an exclusive brand of hearts & arrows. a cut above (aca®) is unmatched in its brilliance, fire and sparkle and remains the only hearts & arrows diamond sold online with advertised standards and a âtrue patterningâ guarantee. in addition, whiteflash offers original handcrafted platinum and gold settings, diamond engagement rings and wedding bands, custom designed engagement rings and diamond jewelry. whiteflash articles
