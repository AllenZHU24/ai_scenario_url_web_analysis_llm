whiteflash truly delivers excellent customer service! i was researching engagement rings to buy, and online vendors seemed like a viable choice. there were a couple of online sites that i tried to contact and speak to, but whiteflash seemed like the easiest to access and gave me the most information, including personal opinions on diamonds and ring settings. replies were prompt, and they always kept me in the loop regarding the shipment of the ring. the ring i received was more beautiful than i had expected! i do need to get the ring resized though (error on my part), but i don't see any hiccups sending it back for a quick tweak. barring any future mishaps, whiteflash seems to be a very, very trustworthy place to buy a ring. 12/29/2011, albert c, usa share this best buying experience ever! the photographs were amazing. i must say, that your operation is so well done. this has been probably the best buying experience i have ever had. thank you so much! 12/29/2011, richard h, usa share this impressed - for the second time! the pendant is perfect! thank you for your help and for getting the order together so quickly. i’m truly impressed, for the second time, with everyone at whiteflash 12/29/2011, michael w, usa share this the ring is beautiful i picked up the ring yesterday. i wasn't expecting such a big package but the ring is beautiful. everyone i showed it to loved it. thank you for doing such a great job and checking in. merry christmas and happy new year to the entire whiteflash team. 12/29/2011, david a, usa share this exactly how engagement ring shopping should be! the ring is fantastic! it came out even better than expected and i truly enjoyed the whole experience. this is exactly how engagement ring shopping should be! merry christmas! 12/29/2011, arun s, usa share this whiteflash - simply the best online diamond vendor i've been searching for a diamond for over a year. the idea of purchasing online can be a bit daunting for those not experienced in what to look for in a diamond. thankfully, with the assistance from the honest and knowledgeable diamond specialists of whiteflash, this is no longer true. they are completely truthful about their diamonds as well as their competitor's diamonds and how the "4 c's" affect the beauty of the diamond. they push nothing onto the seller and encourage the seller to check out other vendors after obtaining information on what to look for in a diamond. this was fantastic, as i felt like i was able to pick wanted without any pressure. i ended up purchasing their signature "a cut above" diamond and can say that this is the prettiest diamond i've ever seen. imagine the sparkle and fire that is seen in many diamonds under the special lighting at various jewelers and then getting that from low light, everyday situations. the sparkle that comes from this diamond is unbelievable! with the quality of the diamond and the quality of the customer service i received from whiteflash, they will have my business for many, many years to come. 12/29/2011, tony p, usa share this amazing experience i got to hear about whiteflash through a friend who purchased his engagement rings from them. he only had great things to say. but i was skeptical about the whole buying and shopping experience let alone the security and assurance of online diamond shopping after shopping around at local jewellers in melbourne, i was dissapointed at the quality and pricing of the designs available. hence i decided to give whiteflash a shot. i was really impressed with their custom designs and range of diamonds, however being a skeptic, i thought they could have easily photoshopped these pictures and have a really awesome web designer to design their site. but i decided to inquire anyway. i was really impressed with their prompt and excellent service, especially their online chat and vast knowledge and expertise. i just received my ring yesterday and it is way better than the photos on the site . 12/22/2011, jay t., australia share this a great buying experience--twice! at first i was very skeptical to purchase diamond jewelry online (that was a lot of money to spend "sight unseen"). after talking with several people at whiteflash, i finally decided to give them a try. all i can say is, wow! their customer service is outstanding, the ring was absolutely beautiful, and shipping was lightning fast and packaged very well. after i purchased the e-ring, we went to a mall jewelry store to purchase a wedding band. after a disappointing fit between the two rings, we consulted with whiteflash once again. they gave us 2 different recommendations, one of which we ended up purchasing from them. the rings fit together beautifully. i couldn't be happier with the experiences i've had with wf. two gorgeous rings and absolutely stellar customer service keeps me coming back. 12/22/2011, clay w., usa share this happy...excellent customer service! i purchased the halo bezel pendant in platinum - the pendant does not flip at all due to its great design and sliding chain. this is my second purchase from whiteflash (first purchase was diamond stud earrings) and i am always happy with the excellent customer service and quality of end product. i worked with liza and she was very knowledgeable and responsive. 12/22/2011, lysa b, bermuda share this best experience ever! whiteflash is one of the best companies i have dealt with. some might be skeptical about buying jewelry online as i was but i cannot be more happy with my purchase. i spoke with liza both in an email and on the phone and i couldn't have brought my ring without her. the customer is in the best interest and their company policies cannot be beat. their prices are super competitive because you can search their database and compare it to other diamond sites. their settings for rings cannot be beat, it is absolutely beautiful. they are also custom made with every order. be sure to try to negotiate because you can take a few percentage off here and there. i would definitely buy from them without any hesitation. best ring company online in the business!!
