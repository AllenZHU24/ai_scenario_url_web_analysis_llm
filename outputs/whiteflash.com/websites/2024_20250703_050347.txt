and we are very happy about them. both diamonds are truly outstanding as compared to those inside the local jewellery store in hong kong. to be honest, buying a diamond online is a difficult decision

against her engagement ring. santiago r, california, usa january 07, 2025 the earrings are beautiful. thank you again for your support and responsiveness. joseph p, california, usa january 07, 2025 my wife was thrilled with the tennis bracelet and earrings i purchased from whiteflash. they arrived on time and in perfect condition. i appreciated the quality of the gold work, the perfectly matched near colorless stones and the surprising sparkle from both pieces. many tennis bracelets can be dull and lifeless given their smaller, poor quality diamonds. while i had options to purchase these items elsewhere for less money, i chose whiteflash because of their focus on offering only quality products. i also purchased my wife’s hearts and arrows diamond engagement ring from whiteflash several years ago, and it has provided great joy due to its white color and constant sparkle. it still gets frequent compliments from strangers. thank you, brittany for your advice and help with the purchase. you were on target as usual! and thanks to whiteflash for being steadfastly dedicated to quality. looking forward to my next purchase. tim s, connecticut, usa january 06, 2025 my wife really
