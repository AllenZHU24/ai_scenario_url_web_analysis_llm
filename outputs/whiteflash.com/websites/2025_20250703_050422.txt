force in the modern era bringing both quality and value to the online diamond shopper. our extremely popular 100% lifetime upgrade guarantee is another wonderful benefit of choosing an a cut above® diamond. while most trade-up programs have complicated restrictions or burdensome requirements, the whiteflash upgrade benefit is simple and straight-forward. it allows you to purchase any a cut above® diamond with the knowledge that you will have full stored value to use in the future should you ever wish to upgrade a different diamond. and with the biggest inventory of ideal and super ideal diamonds of any retailer anywhere, wonderful options for upgrades are plentiful.most jewelry stores do not even offer a written trade up guarantee, and those merchants that do usually require their customers to choose a new diamond that is double the price, or to increase size, color, clarity or particular combinations, often with very limited inventory options available. still others require their customers to return to the store at regular intervals to have the diamond inspected in order to maintain the trade-up policy. such a requirement is highly impractical for the internet shopper.whiteflash is very different. ours is a hassle-free, no red tape, no fine print, customer- centric benefit. we make sure our program is as generous as possible because we want to serve our customers in the way that is best for them. we know that a great upgrade program allows a shopper to buy comfortably within their budget today without compromising quality, and increase size when the time is right.while many buyers plan on upgrading at some point in the future, others who never thought they would trade-up eventually do take advantage of the benefit. 5 year and 10 year anniversaries prove to be great opportunities for upgrades as tastes change and buying power increases. it’s a tremendous benefit to always have in your back pocket!below you will find our uncomplicated trade up policies clearly explained.whiteflash a cut above diamondsthe purchase of any whiteflash a cut above® diamond automatically qualifies you for our 100% lifetime upgrade
