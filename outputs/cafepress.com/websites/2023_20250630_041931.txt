(including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs), actions and damages of all kinds based on, arising out of or in connection with your use of the services and/or the products, your breach of these terms and/or your use of any third-party site, service and/or product. if you are a california resident, you hereby waive california civil code section 1542, which states that: “a general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” if you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you hereby waive any comparable statute or doctrine. privacy policy the terms of our privacy policy are hereby incorporated by reference into these terms. dispute resolution (arbitration agreement; class action waiver; jury trial waiver) please read this section carefully. it affects rights that you may otherwise have. it provides for resolution of disputes that you and we may have with each other by using final and binding individual arbitration (except as specifically provided below). for purposes of this dispute resolution section only, “we” or “us” refers to us and our present and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, shareholders, members, directors, managers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents. in individual arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and potential for appellate review than in court. this dispute resolution section, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement, class action waiver, and jury trial waiver, will survive termination of these terms. arbitration agreement binding arbitration. this provision is intended to be interpreted broadly. any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these terms, the service, and/or your purchase and/or use of the product(s), or your relationship with us whether based in contract, tort, product liability, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory (“dispute”) will be resolved only through binding individual arbitration, except that either you or we may elect to take a dispute to small claims court so long as it isn’t removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. whether a dispute falls within the jurisdictional limits of small claims court will be for the small claims court to decide in the first instance. dispute will include, without limitation: (a) any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of these terms or prior iteration hereof (including, without limitation, disputes or claims pertaining to advertising); (b) any dispute or claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (c) any dispute or claim that may arise after termination of these terms. dispute, however, does not include disagreements or claims involving intellectual property rights. the arbitrator will decide all issues except the following (which will be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide): (a) issues that are reserved in these terms for a court; (b) issues that pertain to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this dispute resolution section; and (c) issues that pertain to the arbitrability of any dispute. these terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you or us from bringing a dispute to the attention of any government agency. these terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and that they will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the federal arbitration act and federal arbitration law. mandatory informal dispute resolution process. you and we will work together in an effort to informally resolve any dispute between us. the party initiating the dispute must send the other a written notice of the dispute that includes all of the following information: (a) information sufficient to identify any transaction and account at issue; (b) the initiating party’s contact information (name, address, telephone number, and email address); and (c) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the dispute and the relief sought, including, without limitation, a calculation for it. the notice must be personally signed by the party initiating the dispute (and their counsel, if represented). if you have the dispute with us, you must send this notice to us at planetart, llc, 23801 calabasas road, suite 2005, calabasas, california 91302, attn.: general counsel. if we have the dispute with you, we may send this notice to the most recent contact information we have for you. for a period of sixty (60) days from receipt of a completed notice (which can be extended by agreement between you and us), you and we will negotiate in good faith in an effort to informally resolve the dispute. the party receiving the notice may request a telephone settlement conference to aid in the resolution of the dispute. if such a conference is requested, you and we (through a company representative) agree to personally participate in the conference (with your and our counsel, if represented). the conference will be scheduled for a mutually convenient time, which may be outside of the 60-day period. completion of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process (this “process”) will be a condition precedent to initiating a claim in arbitration. if the sufficiency of a notice or compliance with this process is at issue, such issue may be raised with and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either party’s election, and any arbitration will be stayed during the pendency of such action. the court will have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to initiating a claim in arbitration, which includes, without limitation, the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. nothing in this section limits the right of either you or us to seek relief in arbitration for non-compliance with this process. all applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed notice through the conclusion of this process. you or we may commence arbitration if the dispute is not resolved through this process. arbitration procedures. the arbitration of any dispute will be administered by national arbitration & mediation (“nam”) and conducted in accordance with the applicable nam rules as modified by this arbitration agreement (including the comprehensive dispute resolution rules and procedures and/or the supplemental rules for mass arbitration filings, as applicable) (“nam rules”). the nam rules are available online at https://namadr.com, by calling nam at 1-800-358-2550, or by requesting them in writing at the notice address. if nam is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this arbitration agreement, you and we will agree on an administrator that will do so, provided that if you and we cannot agree then you and we will jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so. an arbitration demand must be accompanied by a certification of compliance with the process and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and counsel, if the party is represented). by submitting an arbitration demand, the party and counsel represent that, as in court, they will comply with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure 11(b). the arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under federal rule of civil procedure 11 on represented parties and/or their counsel. the arbitrator will have the right to re-allocate their compensation, expenses and/or administrative fees, as well as your and our fees and costs related to the arbitration, if they determine that a claim, defense and/or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous. an arbitration will be before a single, neutral arbitrator. you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by a phone, video, or in-person hearing, or through written submissions, except any dispute seeking $25,000 or more and any dispute seeking injunctive relief will have an in-person or video hearing unless you and we agree otherwise. you and we reserve the right to request a hearing in any matter from the arbitrator. you, along with our company representative, will personally appear at any hearing (with your and our counsel, if represented). any in-person hearing will be held in the county, parish or equivalent governmental geographic area in which you reside or another location upon which you and we agree. an arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the single party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of us may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. further, unless you and we agree otherwise, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. an arbitrator will apply these terms as a court would. if, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain essential findings and conclusions. the arbitrator will apply the cost-shifting provisions of federal rule of civil procedure 68 after entry of an award. judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, except an award that has been satisfied may not be entered. an award will have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding in which you are not a named party. costs of arbitration. payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the nam rules and fee schedule. you and we agree that you and we have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. you and we (and your and our counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all parties. additional procedures for mass filings. these additional procedures for mass filings (in addition to the other provisions of this arbitration agreement) will apply if you choose to participate in a mass filing. if 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“mass filing”), you understand that the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court and not in arbitration. as part of these procedures, your and our counsel will meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and nam’s resource. if your claim is part of a mass filing, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled for your dispute from the time that your dispute is first submitted to nam until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this provision. stage one: if at least 100 disputes are submitted as part of the mass filing, counsel for the claimants and counsel for us will each select 50 disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. the number of disputes to be selected to proceed in stage one can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 100 disputes, all will proceed individually in stage one). each of the 100 (or fewer) cases will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. if a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim will be selected to proceed as part of stage one. the remaining disputes will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims. after this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in stage one), and we will pay the mediator’s fee. stage two: if the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of stage one, counsel for the claimants and counsel for us will each select 100 disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process. the number of disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 200 disputes, all will proceed individually in stage two). no more than five cases may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually. if a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim will be selected to proceed as part of stage two. the remaining disputes will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor will any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. after this second set of staged proceedings, the parties will engage in a global mediation session of all remaining disputes with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in stages one and two), and we will pay the mediator’s fee. upon the completion of the mediation set forth in stage two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn will be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the terms. notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in stage two (except disputes will be randomly selected and mediation will be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually-agreeable process. a court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce the additional procedures for mass filings, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. the additional procedures for mass filings provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. if, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the additional procedures for mass filings apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute will not proceed in arbitration and will only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the terms. future changes to arbitration agreement. if we make any future changes to this arbitration agreement (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice to the following address within 30 days of the change: planetart, llc, 23801 calabasas road, suite 2005, calabasas, california 91302, attn.: general counsel. such written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration altogether. by rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and us in accordance with this version of the arbitration agreement. class action waiver; jury trial waiver any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action. you and we will each waive any right to bring or to participate in such an action in arbitration or in court to the fullest extent allowable by applicable law. notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we each retain the right to participate in a class-wide settlement. to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and we waive the right to a jury trial. miscellaneous

provided herein, if any provision of these terms is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. in addition to such other provisions that, by their terms, survive any termination of these terms, the following sections will survive termination of these terms: (a) limitations of liability provisions; (b) disclaimer of warranties; (c) indemnification; and (d) dispute resolution (including arbitration agreement, class action waiver and jury trial waiver). except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of these terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, a modified provision will be substituted that carries out as nearly as possible your and our original intent as evidenced solely by the language of these terms, and the validity, legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of these terms will not in
