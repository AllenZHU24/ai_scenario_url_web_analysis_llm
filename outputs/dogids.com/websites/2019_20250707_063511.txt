international or apc logistics.  each option offers different prices and timelines. usps international: delivered through the united states postal system and then your country's postal system. taxes and duties will be requested upon delivery and are the responsibility of the receiver. ups international: delivered through ups. taxes and duties will be requested upon delivery and are the responsibility of the receiver. apc international: dogids will ship your items to apc's facility in the united states, and then they will ship internationally with tracking all the way to your door. this is a duty and tax prepaid service meaning you will not incur any additional charges upon delivery. you can track your apc tracking number here: https://us.mytracking.net/apc/track/ because the shipping rates depend on the products being ordered, the shipping destination & the speed of delivery, we are unable to give specific rates per country. however, with our mix of shipping partners, we are confident that we have some of the best rates in international shipping available for our customers. zonos international icon troubleshooting if you are shipping to a foreign country, but don't
