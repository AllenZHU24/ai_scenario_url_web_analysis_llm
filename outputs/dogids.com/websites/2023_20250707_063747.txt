dogids shipping information our primary delivery methods are usps and fedex for standard shipping on most tags, collars and other smaller items. fedex and ups are used for larger items or expedited orders. orders will ship after they are made by our team - every product is different, so we recommend checking the product listing for details on how long it takes to make the item before it ships. choosing expedited shipping will only change the shipping time, not  the production time, of your order. however, we do try to move expedited orders to the top of our production queue best we can. once your order is shipped, you will receive an email notification from us with your tracking information. you can then follow the tracking link in your email to the usps, fedex or ups order tracking web page to check on the status of your shipment. we guarantee delivery* of our orders, so if your package is misplaced or lost in transit, we will remake and reship your order to you. if you think your package may have been lost in the mail, please contact us as soon as possible. if you have not reached out to us within 60 days of the package being shipped, we may be unable to replace it for you. please note that orders with multiple items may result in multiple shipments as not all products ship from the same warehouse. if your order is shipped from various warehouses, you will receive email notifications and tracking information for each shipment. you will not be charged extra for multiple shipments. *please note, dogids does not guarantee delivery of orders if an error is made by the customer, i.e. entering the incorrect shipping address. oversized shipping items with heavy weights or large dimensions are considered oversized. this applies to most beds, elevated dog bowls, dog crates, dog gates and dog doors. orders with oversized items in them will cost more for expedited shipping than our other products, but are still eligible for free u.s. shipping if your item total is $59 or more. flat rate shipping within the usa & canada free usa standard shipping: we offer free standard shipping within the united states if your shopping cart item total is $59 or more. the subtotal will be calculated after you select the standard usa rate in the shipping estimator area when on your shopping cart page or during checkout. orders being shipped outside of the united states are not eligible. this rate does not apply to any other expedited shipping rates we offer. all dog id tags and items that include a dog tag such as keychains, necklaces, memorial tags, etc. ship free for delivery in the usa. all other items in our store ship to usa locations at a flat rate of $6.95. standard and expedited shipping options are available for orders from the united states, puerto rico and u.s. virgin islands as well as apo, fpo, and dpo addresses. the shipping rates for these locations are listed in the table below. usa standard shipping: orders will be delivered to you within 3-5 days after your order ships, depending on your location. usa fedex 2 day shipping: orders will be delivered to you within 2 days after your order ships. **the fedex 2 day option is only available for the items that we make and ship directly out of our workshop, so not all orders are eligible for this option. you will only be offered this option if your order is eligible. canadian shipping: all orders from our canadian neighbors are shipped via first class usps/canada post. if you would like expedited shipping to canada, please contact us at service@dogids.com and we will be happy to give you a shipping quote. duty & tax calculations for shipments outside of the united states are the responsibility of the customer and will vary depending on final delivery location and merchandise value. dogids does not claim responsibility for any accrued import duties & taxes, as these fees are collected by your local government. ***usa & canadian shoppers: make sure usa or canada is active in the widget located in the lower left portion of your screen displaying a round flag. selecting countries other than usa or canada will redirect you to our international checkout flow, which does

checkout portal when you are ready to checkout. if you are from the usa or canada, make sure usa or canada is already selected so you do not get redirected to our international checkout portal. if you are shipping to a foreign country, but don't see a small circle shaped widget in the lower left portion of the screen with your country's flag in it, please add this text: ?zcountry=your 2 digit country code to the end of your url and it will make our international checkout widget pop up for your country. this procedure may be necessary if you are using a vpn or other type of ip address
