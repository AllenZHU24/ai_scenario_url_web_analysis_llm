personalized dog id tags are still a necessity technology is rapidly advancing, but we still have the same issue...dogs can't talk. hence, dog id tags are a necessity. yes, tracking them with the latest high-tech tracking collar helps us keep tabs on them, but batteries go dead, and wi-fi and cell phone signals aren't always reliable. most people who find a lost dog still prefer to look for a dog id tag with a phone number to call immediately rather than go through additional technology steps. and let's face it, not everyone is tech-savvy. a personalized collar or pet tag is still the most reliable way to keep your pet known and safely home. our dog tags aren't just for dogs let's get something straight. just because our company name has "dog" in it, doesn't mean we only make id tags for dogs. oh no, we make them for animals of all shapes and sizes. cats, horses, goats, cows, ferrets, you name it. we even make them for people too! making personalized dog tags, dog collars and personalized pet accessories has been our core business over the years. we like to apply that same wisdom we've gained to all pets whenever we get the opportunity. many pet parents also like to use our name plates and id tags for: leashes kennels harnesses food bags travel pet carriers other pet accessories our dog tags can be put on pretty much anything you want to keep track of that you can attach a split ring or s-hook to. always have backup tags on hand still have “dog id tags” on your checklist? while you're checking the box off of your list, we recommend taking advantage of our discounts for multiple dog tags. our quantity discounts are listed on all of our pet id tag product pages. if you buy 2 or more dog tags, we automatically discount the price of each tag by 25% in your cart! it's good to always have backup tags on-hand for your pooch in case you get a new collar, or he happens to lose his name tag. we don't know how they do it, but it seems if they find a way to lose their dog tags, they will, and sometimes even repeatedly. it's also a good idea to have multiple tags if you travel to different locations like a weekend cottage. you never know when your pet will decide to go on a solo adventure so having ids with contact information for wherever you travel is always a good practice. if you foster or dog sit, you may want to have a few extra id tags on hand for new canine clients staying with you as well. that way, if the dog you're watching gets lost, the finder will call your phone number for a more swift return. huge selection of pet id tag designs to choose from we have lots of options to help you create a perfect personalized id for your pooch. our dog tags for pets are available in several colors, shapes, and sizes. if you prefer the classic dog tag look, we carry brass dog tags, which aren't as easy to find as they used to be. unique dog tag collections with hundreds of designs while you're browsing our hundreds of unique dog id tag designs, make sure to check out our themed dog tag collections too. you'll find many designs to pick from in each collection once you get to its product information page. some of our themed tag collections have dozens and dozens of designs to choose from. choose from: dog id tags with a dog breed design state designs representing where you’re from a hobby related design and more! if you don't see one that you believe will be the perfect design for your pup, contact us so we can help you get a custom tag order started. what information should you put on your custom dog tags? no matter which style id tags you prefer for your pet, we highly recommend including at least one phone number when deciding on what personal contact information to have engraved on your pet's name tag. two or three phone numbers is even better. other information you might include is: any medical conditions whether your pet needs medication your pet’s name your last name we also have medical alert tags that add extra awareness to whatever health condition people need to know about. are double-sided custom pet tags better than one-sided? yes, the more contact information on a pet tag, the better. even if it seems you only need a dog name tag with one side engraved and the other side blank, we recommend considering a tag with both sides engraved, so you can include as much contact information as possible on the id. even if it's just a name on one side, that frees up space for contact information on the other side of your tag. is my dog's id lifetime guaranteed? seriously? yes! every dog id tag we produce is laser engraved deeply and comes with a lifetime guarantee. and yes, they're made in the usa , right here in fargo, north dakota. if you find any part of our workmanship to be unsatisfactory, we'll replace your pet id at no cost to you. what if my dog loses his tag? we always joke in our office, "if you ever want to thoroughly test or break a product, just put it on a dog." dogs put products through extreme conditions, and sometimes they lose their dog tags. if this happens, just contact us. we'll look up your latest order to help you duplicate your dog's lost tag and get it shipped out to you as soon as possible. dog name tags with flat rate shipping and tracking our flat-rate shipping ensures no shipping fee surprises when you check out, and you'll receive a tracking number when your order ships. your dog's id will arrive on time and in mint condition, ready to wear with the necessary attachment hardware. we utilize usps for shipping dog tags and always provide you with a tracking number for your shipment. you can relax knowing that dogids takes your pet's safety seriously from the moment we start producing your dog's ids, until you receive them.
