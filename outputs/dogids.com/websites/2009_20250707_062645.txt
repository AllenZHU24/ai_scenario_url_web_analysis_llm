stamped on a small piece of metal that is worn on a metal chain around the neck. during world war ii, certain medical information such as the date of the soldier's last tetanus shot was also included on the tag. the name tag is primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded. in the event the member has a medical condition that requires special attention, an additional red tag with the pertinent information is issued and worn with the dog tags. painted stainless steel designer dog tags by andrewprice: $15.00now: $15.00, 2 for $27.00, 5 for $60.00personalized leather dog collar with name plate built inprice: $29.00personalized double braid dog collar with name plate built inprice: $22.00now: $18.00, 2 for $32.00engraved stainless steel dog collar nameplate -
