solid brass does tarnish. some people like the look of tarnished brass better than polished brass...to each his own. while your dog is wearing a solid brass id tag, depending how active he is, he is constantly rubbing it on his coat and other obstacles. this alone will usually keep the id tag in a polished brass state. however, if your dog is not wearing his id tag for extended periods, it may tend to tarnish from the elements - humidity, etc. depending on wear and how it is stored. if your dog's id tag does happen to develop some tarnish, not to worry...lightly polishing it with a standard brass polish will bring it back to a like-new state in just a few seconds. what are the differences between brass & stainless steel dog id tags? the main difference between brass and stainless steel besides color is hardness. stainless steel is exceptionally harder than brass and therefore wears longer. there many factors that determine how fast the material of your dog tag will wear down. here are a couple examples: if you have a very active dog such as a hunting dog that is running through brush, etc. frequently, you may want to consider ordering a stainless steel id tag. if your dog wears several tags that constantly rub against each other, this will eventually wear the metal down and make the engraving appear shallow. since brass is softer and does gradually wear down, over extended periods of hard use, the engraved characters on brass id tags may become more 'shallow' and appear to fade as opposed to stainless steel which is more resistant to wear. what is english bridle leather? why are our english bridle leather collars and leads a cut above the rest? detail... it's the way each stitch is precisely sewn for optimum durability and beauty. it's the way each thread is trimmed for a clean, finished look. it's the way all leather edges are trimmed, rolled and sealed. it's the way each piece of solid brass hardware is chosen for its utility and great looks. learn more. what is polypropylene? polypropylene or polypropene (pp) is a thermoplastic polymer, made by the chemical industry and used in a wide variety of applications, including packaging, textiles (e.g., ropes, thermal underwear and carpets), stationery, plastic parts and reusable containers of various types, laboratory equipment, loudspeakers, automotive components, and polymer banknotes. an addition polymer made from the monomer propylene, it is rugged and unusually resistant to many chemical solvents, bases and acids. learn more. subscribe to our newsletter. we believe in giving back to the animals in our lives who give us so much. if you do too, be our pal! dogids blog facebook pinterest twitter google+ youtube need help or have a question?
