collar size how to measure your dog's girth how to determine your dog's collar size all of our collars (unless otherwise noted on the product page) are measured to the center hole for a true neck size or will list the neck size range that the collar will fit. the measurement of your dog’s neck is the size of the collar it needs. no guesswork needed to buy a collar that fits your dog correctly and comfortably.for example, if you measure your dog’s neck and get 16”, you should pick a 16” collar or a collar where 16” is comfortably within the size range. each collar will have adjustment holes above and below the middle one, so you will also get 1-2 inches of extra adjustment in either direction. simply measure your dog’s neck for the proper collar size. there should always be enough room between the pet’s neck and the collar to slip one finger between them comfortably. this ensures that the collar isn't too tight. here are a few different methods for measuring your dog's neck: measure your dog's neck with a sewing tape. or wrap a string around your dogs neck. mark the string and then measure the length of it with a ruler or tape measure. or remove your dog's current collar and stretch it out flat. then measure from the center of the buckle to the current sizing hole or adjustment being used. in between sizes? if your dog is full grown and their measurement is in between the sizes listed, pick the smaller of the two sizes. that way, you won't have extra material hanging off of the end of the collar. if your dog is still growing, go with the larger option. if the collar has a size range, we recommend choosing the size range where your measurment is close to the middle of the sizes so you have room to adjust up and down. how to measure your dog's girth a variety of dog products, including harnesses and coats may be sized using a dog's girth. to determine your dog's girth, use a sewing tape or string to measure behind your dog's front legs to get their chest circumference. you should be measuring around your dog's rib cage about an inch or two behind the front legs. subscribe to our newsletter join our email list for deals, pet parent tips and new
