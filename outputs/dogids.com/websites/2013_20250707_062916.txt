lucky 2 young girls found her walking alone past our city library. she was safely returned home. why? the girls explained they saw her name & address on her dogids collar. thank you! gail - wauwatosa, wi hands down the greatest dog collar and tags ever! i run hog dogs in sime rough, dirty terrain and these are the first collars i've had that've lasted more than 6mo. and since nobody wants to kneel down and try to find tags on my 90lb dogo argentino, or my high energy (aka wild!) black mouth curs the scruff tags make it easy to just stand above the dogs from behind and dial the number/read the tag info. i'll never use anything else! johnny - fresno, ca we just received our new english bridle leather personalized dog collar today and... it is absolutely beautiful! we have a "runner" here, she just doesn't know any better. though we do our absolute best to contain her the occasional "free roam" is inevitable! we feel so much better just having a great collar on, with her name and address for a quick recovery if need be. thank you for all you do! jake - rolling meadows, il i just received the bone shaped dog id tag for jasper, you guys/girls are absolutely fantastic!! i just ordered this tag two days ago and it looks great. love the engraving style. we changed our phone # so i needed a new id tag. i will have to order another for florida this fall with the new phone #. i have told several people about your company. thank you for the great service and good looking id tag. heather - fairfield, ct ordered an english bridle leather collar w/nameplate on 4/29/10. received it the next day!
