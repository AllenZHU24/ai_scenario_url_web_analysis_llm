top quality custom engraved dog id tags and personalized collars. we only use top quality engraving materials and cutting edge laser engraving equipment to ensure our dog id tags and nameplates are produced in a uniform manner with top-notch appearance and life-long readability. since we only use solid brass, stainless steel, gold plated brass and nickel plated brass materials, you can be assured that your custom laser engraved dog id tags or nameplate collars will last for years without peeling, fading, discoloring or causing skin irritations like some other plated metals can. we use the latest fiber laser technology to engrave our tags. many pet tag manufacturers use lower power co2 laser engravers that do not actually engrave the metal but rather mark or laser bond on the metal. this type of laser marking does leave a clean dark mark but will eventually be illegible as the metal from the tag wears down. we at dogids use a high power fiber laser to engrave our tags which actually vaporizes and removes the metal so it is actually engraving instead of marking or laser bonding. this allows us to engrave deeply into the metal with pristine detail and a nice contrasting engrave color...excellent looks with a true engrave that will never wear off of your dog's tag. engraving guaranteed for life...period! yes, there are less expensive dog id tags on the market but "you get what you pay for". thinner metal that bends easily, stamped instead of engraved, low quality materials, etc. you only get the best materials and workmanship from us here at dogids. if you can type it, we can engrave it. we can engrave any character that can be typed on a standard keyboard so feel free to be creative! we can engrave from 1 to 5 lines of characters on all of our dog id hang tags and dog collar nameplates. just keep in mind that the more lines and characters you want us to engrave, the smaller the text. all characters are centered horizontally and vertically unless you specify otherwise on your order. arial is the default font we use to engrave our dog id tags but we also offer many other different engraving fonts for you to choose from if you would like to! just for dog collars? no! even though the majority of our dog id tags and nameplates are ordered by dog owners for their dog's collar, many of our customers order them for other applications as well. here are some examples: pet leashes. pet beds. horse saddles, bridles, harnesses and halters. horse stall doors. luggage. picture frames and memoirs. and the list goes on and on. personalization with an elegant engraved id tag from dogids adds that little extra touch of class. what information should i have engraved on my dog's tag?
