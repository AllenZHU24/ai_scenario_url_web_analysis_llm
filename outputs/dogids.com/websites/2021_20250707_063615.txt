faqs about laser engraving terms & statements privacy policy dogids shipping information our primary delivery methods are usps and fedex for standard shipping on most tags, collars and other smaller items. fedex and ups are used for larger items or expedited orders. orders will ship after they are made by our team - every product is different, so we recommend checking the product listing for details on how long it takes to make the item before it ships. choosing expedited shipping will only change the shipping time, not  the production time, of your order. once your order is shipped, you will receive an email notification from us with your tracking information. you can then follow the tracking link in your email to the usps, fedex or ups order tracking web page to check on the status of your shipment. we guarantee delivery** of our orders, so if your package is misplaced or lost in transit, we will remake and reship your order to you. if you think your package may have been lost in the mail, please contact us as soon as possible. if you have not reached out to us within 60 days of the package being shipped, we may be unable to replace it for you. covid-19 has impacted delivery times for all carriers. this has resulted in longer than expected shipping times. domestic orders can take up to 3 weeks for delivery, while international order may take 8 weeks. if the delivery time has exceeded these windows, please reach out to our customer service team. please note that orders with multiple items may result in multiple shipments as not all products ship from the same warehouse. if your order is shipped from various warehouses, you will receive email notifications and tracking information for each shipment. you will not be charged extra for multiple shipments. **please note, dogids does not guarantee delivery of orders if an error is made by the customer, i.e. entering the incorrect shipping address. oversized shipping items with heavy weights or large dimensions are considered oversized. this applies to most beds, elevated dog bowls, dog crates, dog gates and dog doors. orders with oversized items in them will cost more for expedited shipping than

states for orders with a subtotal of $75 or more. the subtotal will be calculated after any promo codes or offers to reach the $75. orders being shipped outside of the united states are not eligible.

and then your country's postal system. taxes and duties will be requested upon delivery and are the responsibility of the receiver. fedex international: delivered through fedex. taxes and duties will be charged at checkout and the responsibility of the purchaser. ups international: delivered through ups. taxes and duties will be charged at checkout and the responsibility of the purchaser. zonos
