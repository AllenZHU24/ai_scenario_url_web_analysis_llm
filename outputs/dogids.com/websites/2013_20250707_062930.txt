guarantee at dogids, we use a high power fiber laser to engrave our tags which actually vaporizes and removes the metal so it is actually engraving instead of marking or laser bonding. this allows us to engrave deeply into the metal with pristine detail and a nice contrasting engrave color...excellent looks with a true engrave that will never wear off of your dog's tag. laser engraved dogids tags, collars, and leashes are guaranteed for the life of your pet. if the tag becomes unreadable, contact us to get a replacement. if your order arrives with incorrect engraving and we are at fault, we will also replace the item. shipping information our primary delivery methods are us postal service, fedex and ups. orders will ship based on their estimated production times, which are listed on the
