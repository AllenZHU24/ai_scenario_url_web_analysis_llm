maxium user weight 275 lbs 300 lbs 300 lbs 300 lbs 300 lbs 300 lbs 300 lbs about exercise bikes despite the competition from trendy new fitness inventions, exercise bikes continue to be popular options for home exercise. they offer the same aerobic benefits of riding a bicycle at any time, in any weather, without leaving the comfort and safety of home. exercise bikes don't take up much space, require little or no balance or coordination, and can provide an effective workout for all levels of users, from beginners to serious competitors. while the same could be said for a number of other types of home fitness equipment, the exercise bike is one of the few that allows you to watch television or read a magazine while you work out. for many people, having convenient access to quality exercise equipment is critical to sticking with a long-term exercise program. product details owner's manual [pdf]| assembly manual [pdf] product dimensions: 67 x 13 x 26 inches ; 115.8 pounds

reviews 313 of 325 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars needed a low-impact cardio machine... november 8, 2009 by l. abrams after months of trying to decide if we should buy an exercise bike, we finally bit the bullet. we went right down to dick's sporting goods and even though they didn't have one on display, they did have one int he back. we bought the schwinn 240 due to it being one of the newest models. some of the things we really liked better were minor, but made the difference to us. the number of different programs were higher than the other models. being able to remember a user's information was also a huge positive from other models where every time a different user uses the equipment you have to reset all your information. the cup holder not being under the seat but on the console made more sense and having the basket to store magazines and things just seemed neater. it took about 1.5 hours to assemble. hint: a couple of the parts were already on the bike which was confusing when comparing to the parts list. the model is nice looking, smaller than our elliptical and easy to move around with the wheels. i haven't had it long enough yet to know how it will hold up, but it's very sturdy, very quiet and seems like it will last for a long time. 9 comments | was this review helpful to you? yes no 134 of 141 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars outstanding excercise bicycle! november 19, 2009 by larry b. hughes amazon verified purchase i did extensive research before i bought this bike. i've ridden it for about ten hours since assembly and am simply delighted with it. i am a good mechanic and assembled it by myself in about three hours. the assembly manual has little text, mostly illustrations; but they marginally suffice, more text would be very helpful.the console electronic cable going the top of the front wheel hardware has connectors at both ends -- they must be connected to the proper connectors, they are not the same configuration and are not interchangeable. so beware, the bike parts i received had this cable reversed so i was unable to connect the connectors until i removed the cable and reversed its "to -- from" direction.the text regarding the programming of a user is unsatisfactory, confusing, does not effective communicate to a reader.when registering the bike, you must have its serial number, the serial number is located on the bottom of the front stabilizer, record it before you assemble the bike.in sum, if you are looking for an outstanding recumbent exercise bike at a most reasonable price, i urge you to purchase this bike. comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 289 of 312 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars detailed assembly instructions, with comments on free shipping december 8, 2009 by rudolf schmid vine™ voice amazon verified purchase overview: the schwinn 240 is an excellent recumbent exercise bike. my remarks address problems with shipping and assembly.free shipping via pilot: it works, but, as other reviewers have elaborated, has snags. i ordered the schwinn 240 on 11/22. its delivery originated in hayward ca, 26 miles south of my home. the bike was shipped 11/23 to phoenix az, apparently because pilot is headquartered there. the bike was shipped back to hayward, arriving 11/27, with the box damaged in transit. delivery was scheduled 11/30 for 1:59:48 pm. the bike finally arrived about 7:30pm 11/30. damage was only to the box.instruction booklets:(1) the printed materials supplied are in english and french. supposedly instructions in spanish are available from schwinn's website but i could not locate them. register the bike on schwinn's website in the customer service section.(2) the printed assembly and use booklets are 5.5x8.5 inches (wxl) and are printed on high quality glossy paper that may well outlast the bike. pictures in the assembly booklet are small, only about 40% of the page; about 60% of each page is blank! the small pictures and minuscule labels are hard to read, so get out your magnifying glass. schwinn should take a cue from ikea, which has instructions with large diagrams printed on cheap 8.5x11-inch paper. i assembled the bike using a magnifying glass, repeatedly cursing schwinn.(3) but here is the solution that i found *after* assembling the bike and on starting to peruse the equally hard-to-read use manual. go to schwinn's website and download the pdfs of the assembly and use manuals (these pdfs are also available on this amazon page!). the pages will print out on 8.5x11-inch paper with larger diagrams and print (closer to ikea quality). the written instructions are in english (front) and french (back), so just print out the language needed.(4) schwinn's written instructions (both english and french) are woefully inadequate. hence i offer some detailed elaborations for assembly:time required: at least an hour to unpack the parts, organize them, clean up, and recycle the waste. roughly two hours to assemble the bike properly plus a bit more time to make personal adjustments (seat, pedal straps, console, etc.) on the assembled bike.general assembly points: (1) the screws, washers, and other small parts come attached to two pieces of cardboard, the parts held in place by blister plastic. carefully remove the parts and organize them in the same layout as on the cardboard. do not discard the cardboard until after the bike is assembled. (2) before each assembly step doublecheck diagrams so that you do not install a part backwards or upside down. (3) when connecting two parts carefully align screws with screw holes, finger tighten, and then tool-tighten alternate holes to avoid torquing a part (that is, as one would alternately tighten lug nuts when replacing a flat tire on a vehicle). (4) tighten screws in a clockwise and loosen counterclockwise, or remember the ditty: righty tighty, lefty loosey.expanded assembly instructions: (1) attach stabilizers to main frame: this step is easier with a second person helping to align parts. the larger stabilizer goes in the rear, the smaller one, with wheels forward, goes in the front. record the model and serial number from the bottom of the rear stabilizer before installation. (2) attach side handlebars to seat frame: this step is fairly clear, though it is awkward to juggle the parts being attached. the silver heart-rate-sensors should face up. (3) attach seat pads to seat frame assembly: this is also a juggling step for one person. the seat back has eight holes for the four screws. there is no explanation in the assembly manual but presumably the lower set of holes is for persons of average height whereas the upper set of holes is for very tall persons. (4) slide seat assembly onto seat rail: an insert requires that the seat assembly (item 13) held in place by seven screws (these are loosely tightened) be first removed, (5) connect heart rate cable to seat assembly: a simple step. (6) install seat rail bracket: note the proper orientation of seat bracket (item 10). (7) install seat assembly to frame assembly: this step is easier with a second person helping to align parts. the seat bracket (item 10) goes inside the seat tube. it may have arrived temporarily but improperly installed outside the tube. the electronic cable should be completely inserted in the rear seat tube to avoid crimping the cable. (8) install console mast to frame assembly: be sure the cables are properly oriented and not inverted. male prongs couple to female receptacles; note the tabs for orientation and push with lots of force to couple securely. i found it useful to tie a string to the handlebar ends of the cables in case they fall into the console tube (item 14) during its insertion into the flywheel base. it is easier to insert (loosely tighten) the two side screws first and then the two front screws because the latter might fall inadvertently into the chamber, in which case their retrieval would be tedious. in inserting the four rubber caps do not over-push them into the aforenoted chamber but carefully with a screwdriver put the inner flange of the rubber cap inside the hole. (9) attach upright handlebar to console mast: be sure the handlebars are properly centered on the stem; otherwise the plastic cap (item 9) will not fit properly. (10) attach console bracket to console mast: stick the cables through the console bracket; remove any string. the hex bolt (item 3) and nut (item k) go through the lower pivot holes. use the two tools depicted to tighten the hex bolt and nut so that the bracket pivots freely. the carriage bolt (item f) and plastic knob (item m) go through the upper adjustable arc opening. (11) connect console cables to console: note orientation of the tabs being connecting. be sure the cables are securely attached, (12) attach console to console bracket: don't waste time looking for the four screws. they are attached to the rear of the console and require removal before the required attachment. (13) install pedals on crank arms: the petals and straps are labeled left (l) or right (r). note that the left pedal is tightened counterclockwise (not the usual clockwise to tighten). the logo on the strap goes on top with the larger number of holes toward the outside. depending on storage, one or both straps may be curved the opposite wrong way; beware. (14) connect power cord: a simple step. (15) attach water bottle holder to console mast: watch orientation of parts: black piece outside with the two large holder arms facing up; red piece inside with bottom support facing down. (xx) final adjustments: doublecheck that all screws and bolts are adequately tightened. remove the protective film from the console and sides of the flywheel container. level bike. adjust seat and pedal straps. finally adjust tilt of console for maximum legibility (in my case tilted all the way forward). program console (see use manual, which also needs more detailed instructions). warning: do not unplug the power cord (the transformer stays warm--an energy vampire!) or else your saved settings will be lost. it would be nice if the bike had a memory feature to preserve settings as do digital cameras and other electronic devices. 21 comments | was this review helpful to you? yes no › see all 379 customer reviews (newest first) write a customer review most recent customer reviews
