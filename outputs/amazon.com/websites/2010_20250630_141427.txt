"it's not about excluding men. it's more about women understanding that there comes a time in your life when you want a man. a real man. a grown up. not a boy. and that's not a bad thing."about keri hilson:keri hilson, recently named the new face of avon's imari beauty scent released her riaa gold certified debut album "in a perfect world..." early last year. spawning numerous #1 hits "turning me on" ft. lil'wayne and "knock you down" ft. kanye west & ne-yo, the singer scored critical notoriety winning best new artists awards and nominations from the grammy's, the american music awards, bet awards, naacp image awards, mobo awards and soul train awards. previously the atlanta native appeared on mtv vma's, teen choice awards and vogue's fashion night out in part to the global #1 hit "the way i are" with mentor and super-producer timbaland. product details is discontinued by manufacturer ‏ : ‎ no language ‏ : ‎ english product dimensions ‏ : ‎ 4.96 x 5.63 x 0.43 inches; 3.6 ounces manufacturer ‏ : ‎ interscope/zone 4/mosley item model number ‏ : ‎ 16030947 original release date ‏ : ‎ 2010 date first available ‏ : ‎ september 14, 2010 label ‏ : ‎ interscope/zone 4/mosley asin ‏ : ‎ b0042x90mu number of discs ‏ : ‎ 1 best sellers rank: #102,159 in cds & vinyl (see top 100 in cds & vinyl) #5,496 in vocal pop (cds & vinyl) customer reviews: 4.4 4.4 out of 5 stars 134 ratings brief content visible, double tap to read full content.full content visible, double tap to read brief content. videoshelp others learn more about this product by uploading a video!upload your video products related to this item sponsored page 1 of 1start over previous page of related sponsored products feedback bobby valentino 239 audio cd $13.60$13.60 feedback fanmail 513 audio cd $12.45$12.45 feedback blackstreet 243 audio cd -17%$18.05$18.05typical:$21.65$21.65 feedback donda deluxe 1,201 audio cd -14%$15.47$15.47list:$17.98$17.98 feedback the evolution of robin thicke 580 audio cd $14.98$14.98 feedback perfect symmetry 357 audio cd -42%$6.99$6.99typical:$11.97$11.97 feedback in a perfect world 146 audio cd $18.43$18.43 next page of related sponsored products similar brands on amazonpage 1 of 1start oversponsoredprevious pageshop the store on amazon ›calming mountain stream - babbling brook nature recording - brings you relaxation and sleep - nature's perfect white noise -4.44.4 out of 5 stars602$13.95$13.95shop the store on amazon ›grace and peace: american hymns4.54.5 out of 5 stars100$12.95$12.95next page customer reviews4.4 out of 5 stars4.4 out of 5134 global ratings5 star4 star3 star2 star1 star5 star68%16%10%4%2%68%5 star4 star3 star2 star1 star4 star68%16%10%4%2%16%5 star4 star3 star2 star1 star3 star68%16%10%4%2%10%5 star4 star3 star2 star1 star2 star68%16%10%4%2%4%5 star4 star3 star2 star1 star1 star68%16%10%4%2%2%how customer reviews and ratings workcustomer reviews, including product star ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.to calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on amazon. it also analyzed reviews to verify trustworthiness.learn more how customers reviews work on amazon review this productshare your thoughts with other customerswrite a customer review customers saycustomers find this album to be an excellent purchase with very good production quality. the music receives positive feedback for its irresistible beats, with one customer noting it's fun to dance to. they appreciate the vocal talent, with one review highlighting the artist's effortless rapping and singing. the lyrical content also receives praise, with one customer describing it as the best ballad the artist has done.ai generated from the text of customer reviewsselect to learn morevalue for moneyqualitymusic qualityvocal talentlyrical content17 customers mention "value for money"13 positive4 negativecustomers find the album excellent and worth the money, with one mentioning it's particularly enjoyable for its moments of happiness."...than her debut in a perfect world... which by al means is an excellent album but her follow up seems like more of an album with a meaning to it...." read more"...great album." read more"...no boys allowed" was a refreshing album with a few attitudes we didn't know keri had in her. tip: when beyonce is occupied, take the stage!" read more"...she seems truly invested, which is refreshing on an album so desperate to be a product and not just an artistic statement. b+..." read more11 customers mention "quality"8 positive3 negativecustomers appreciate the quality of the album, with one customer noting the notable production by swizz beatz."...its agressive sexual lyrics make it a standout track with notable production by swizz beatz.

"the way you love me" a hip hop oriented booty shaker is simply that. its agressive sexual lyrics make it a standout track with notable production by swizz beatz. "bahm bahm (do it once again)" is just ok until the interlude "(i want you)" which altho only about a minute and a half puts you into a love making mood as well as the colaboration "one night stand" with chris brown. "lose control" is instantly unique in its sound its absolutly the best track keri has recorded in the dance genre. "toy soldier" and "breaking point" fall a little flat especially following such a stellar track. "beautiful mistake" is another standout track in which keri tells her lover they are two beautiful people that have nothing in common but sexual attraction. "gimme what i want" follows which is on the shorter side but is pretty catchy. "all the boys" is the final ballad which is pretty much saying goodbye to all the hearts i've broken and those who've broke mine. overall this album was really underrated especially with critics. keri is easily a hidden jem in the overly produced r&b genre. read more helpful report marie foxx5.0 out of 5 stars great music for those who enjoy keri hilson. reviewed in the united states on september 15, 2016verified purchase i bought this as a gift for my nephew who is in college. i listened to a few of the songs with him and i liked them. it isn't necessarily something i would get for myself, but i was surprised that i liked a few of the songs. but, this was a gift for him and he loved all the songs. he has a few favorite songs on here, but overall he loves every song. he has played so many times that i have gotten to know a few of the songs. this was a perfect gift and if you are into keri hilson, i totally recommend this. read more helpful report honest reviewer4.0 out of 5 stars very solid effort reviewed in the united states on december 22, 2010verified purchase while i am a keri fan, i was little concerned about her sophomore effort based on the leaked tracks. however, i was pleasantly surprised. yes she has taken on a sexier image, but part of being an artist involves evolution. some of us may like the way she has evolved, and some may not, but in this industry, artists are constantly "re-inventing" themselves to stay relevant. in spite of the sexed up image she is trying to portray, i believe she stayed true to her own style when it comes to the content. you can't beat downloading this album for 5 bucks either, even though a standout track, "hustler," is only on the bonus version (for $9.49). it sounds like she listened to the blogs where folks talked about her and invested in some voice lessons also! so, improved vocal talent, plus writing ability, is a winner in my book! great album. read more helpful report dj5.0 out of 5 stars let me be honest... reviewed in the united states on september 13, 2012verified purchase i only bought this album because keri hilson is on the cover and she's so sexy to listen to; but i was surprised at how much she has matured since her first album. "no boys allowed" was a refreshing album with a few attitudes we didn't know keri had in her. tip: when beyonce is occupied, take the stage! read more helpful report jonathan3.0 out of 5 stars sophomore slump reviewed in the united states on january 13, 2011verified purchase keri hilson did fairly well for herself with 'in a perfect world', her debut album. turnin' me on with lil wayne was a top 20 hit and a smash on the r&b charts, and knock you down was everywhere for a while, reaching the top 5 on the hot 100. yet here ms. hilson is, seeming rather desperate, mixing up a good formula in an attempt to generate more hits.buyou: a good song to start off with. nice, slick production helps, plus j. cole's rap is really well done. this could have easily been included on her last album with the feel it has going. single potential. bpretty girl rock: i'm not sure why keri's managers messed with breaking point as a first single, because this one has lead single written all over it. the production is immaculate, the lyrics are solid, and keri sounds fairly invested. ridiculously catchy; you have been warned. b+the way you love me: almost works, but not quite. this is keri at her most desperate; she attempts to sell the song, giving her all by practically yelling the lyrics, but none of it catches fire. rick ross has a decent rap in it though. cbahm bahm (do it once again) / i want you: the first 2/3 of this song is awful. it all comes off like a watered down version of break it off by rihanna; dancehall at its worst. however, the 'i want you' part is an exquisite bit of sensual r&b. d for bahm bahm, b+ for i want youone night stand: this is a fairly good slow r&b groove, riding a nice beat, but the album really needed something better at this point to really sell this album. keri and chris brown make a nice pair though. b-lose control / let me down: this is finally when things get interesting. while it's a bit too popish, lose control has a solid dance-pop beat, and i never really notice when it switches to let me down. should've replaced bahm bahm earlier. btoy soldier: a bit of a cheesy metaphor that comes off as desperate, but if you get past this, it's a good r&b song. not so heavy on the pop, which is nice for keri. a little forgettable, if nothing else. b-breaking point: critics seem to be raving this song, and normally love timbaland's production, but i disdain this track. it is difficult for me to listen through it, especially the spoken part. awful choice for a lead single, and it bombed accordingly. c-beautiful mistake: this is good until the chorus. heavy on the pop, and the stuttering part doesn't help her case. this pop persona keri is pushing just seems to backfire every time. cgimme what i want: now this is when things heat up. very nice attitude on the song, and the synth-wrapped opening is warranted. heavy on pop, but it finally works. ball the boys: i'd go so far to say this is keri's best ballad she's ever done. she seems truly invested, which is refreshing on an album so desperate to be a product and not just an artistic statement. b+pretty girl rock remix: as much kanye as keri, if not more. he kills it, but if you weren't a fan of the original, this won't change your mind. b+just reviewing this album frustrated me once again. 'in a perfect world' was my favorite r&b album of the year, and that was the same time when a beyonce album got dropped. i wanted something like get your money up or intuition or even change me, but got an album from an artist that might as well be an unknown. keri's done a 180 here, and not in a good way. don't buy the whole album, even if it's still 5 dollars.recommended downloads: buyou, pretty girl rock (or remix), all the boys read more 5 people found this helpful helpful report mary jane sternberg5.0 out of 5 stars my jam is very good quality! reviewed in the united states on december 17, 2013verified purchase i was amazed by how quickly i got this cd! keri hilson definitely kilted her amazing voice and talent through this! i absolutely love jamming to this in my car! its worth paying less than $20 or $15 getting this through here than any other place. highly recommend buying anything/everything through amazon! read more helpful report see more reviews top reviews from other countries translate all reviews to english g5.0 out of 5 stars un sophomore album excellent reviewed in france on february 17, 2015verified purchase dans la lignée du premier, un peu plus punchy, ce second album fait parti de ma playlist à vie. vivement le troisème!!! read more report translate review to english amazon customer5.0 out of 5 stars quick delivery in good condition reviewed in canada on may 22, 2024verified purchase everything is fine read more report alex m.5.0 out of 5 stars new version!!! reviewed in germany on july 8, 2011verified purchase 1.
