(directions for cancellation included for those interested) december 9, 2014 by katie this trial really is a no-strings-attached trial! it was extremely easy to cancel at any time (see the bottom of this review for directions). i originally cancelled it after my trial but after a year i decided to start up my membership again. both processes went smoothly.as for audible, itself. i truly love the wide selection of books it has to offer. the 1-year return (with no questions asked) policy of any book is a great convenience too. it's wonderful how audible syncs across many devices so i never have to find where i last dropped off at. i'd encourage anyone to give this program a try. you might end up missing it like i did.thanks for a great program, amazon!here are the directions for cancellation because it seems to be a commonly asked question:1. sign in to your audible account2. click the part that says "hi, [your name]!" on the top center of the page.3. in the drop-down menu that appears click "account details"4. the second box from the top is titled "account settings" and within that box it says "cancel my membership". click that and follow the self-explanatory steps :) comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 41 of 46 people found the following review helpful 3.0 out of 5 stars if cancelling, do it before the month is up by at least a day. fire hd7 too quiet without stereo connection or headset in car. november 18, 2014 by swedish-italian gal it's a nice option to try audible books, however, i was charged before the full month was up for a gold plan which was $16 per month. when i contacted amazon, they refunded it. however, you may want to cancel 2 days before your month is up in order to avoid the hassle.also, they recommend options that i didn't know where available when i cancelled in the cancellation process: 7.95 for 3 months, and a 9.95 year light reading plan without accumulating credits. you may like those options, but why not offer them before in an open way?audible is not loud enough on the new hd7 fire without connecting to a stereo or headphones in the car, so that was a big disappointment as i wanted to try it out and let both of us enjoy listening on the road. if you have an older car, it just isn't an option. 1 comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 22 of 23 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars i only have good things to say about audible october 31, 2014 by kelly i only have good things to say about audible. it has become an essential part of my daily train commute. i particularly love the author-narrated books -- they take on a whole new amazing dynamic (a hilarious example: amy poehler's "yes, please"). the membership come with credits that you exchange for any book in the audible library. if you use a credit on a book you're not crazy about, you can exchange it. really simple. 1 comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 17 of 19 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars makes me a better person! october 8, 2014 by aniket gune i listened to the "power of vulnerability" by brene brown (no i don't get paid any commission - just love the audiobook) during my audible subcription and was hooked to listening to books. since then love listening to a wide selection of non-fiction, great courses, tech and biographies using my audible membership, especially when i am busy and unable to "read" with my eyes. all it takes is one inspiring story, one riveting listen to look at the world around you differently! comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 6 of 6 people found the following review helpful 4.0 out of 5 stars i love audible, but i wish that i could use ... november 28, 2014 by tomas i. i love audible, but i wish that i could use my amazon gcs for audible since audible is owned by amazon. even if amazon would offer a means for buying a gc on amazon to use on audbile, i'd be happy with that. 4 comments | was this review helpful to you? yes no 7 of 8 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars best value in audio october 29, 2014 by andrew audible has an amazing selection of audiobooks that make your commute, workout, or downtime more enjoyable. try it and you'll be hooked. 1 comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 3 of 3 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars wish i discovered product sooner. december 21, 2014 by katsky wish i discovered this product sooner. having the time to read books has become difficult with busy schedule and long days sitting at the computer. now i can listen to books on my phone as i'm out and about. you can even change the speed of the audio book, bookmark pages and make notes. great product. thank you! comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no 8 of 10 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars perfect for the ultra-marathoner. october 29, 2014 by francis shanahan the best quality audiobooks and selection on the market. accept no substitutes. i listen on my long-runs, be sure to checkout scott jurek's and dean karnazes books. comment | was this review helpful to you? yes no › see all 16 customer reviews (newest first) write a customer review most recent customer reviews 5.0 out of 5 stars perfect i absolutely love this app. i work in sales and have very long drives daily. listening to audiobooks through audible breaks up the day. read more published 2 days ago by christian diaz 4.0 out of 5 stars i have used audible for several years and love almost everything about... i have used audible for several years and love almost everything about it. for most of that time, i commuted about 30 miles to work and audible changed that from an onerous task... read more published 5 days ago by richard l. weaver 2.0 out of 5 stars very frustrating experience i just started my free membership today and it has been a very frustrating experience to say the least. read more published 9 days ago by loretta chabrak 1.0 out of 5 stars audible robbed my credit card info from amazon and charged me for... i am very upset because i noticed i have 2 charges of $14.95 for audible membership and i have not requested. read more published 15 days ago by amazon customer 1.0 out of 5 stars don't like it. i have spent the past hour trying ... signed up. don't like it. i have spent the past hour trying to cancel. can anyone help? there seems to be no way to manage your account or cancel online. read more published 21 days ago by rt 1.0 out of 5 stars one star how do you cancel this subscription?! i can't figure it out but it says cancel anytime?! published 24 days ago by laurenmsd 1.0 out of 5 stars i am very upset because i noticed i have three ... i am very upset because i noticed i have three charges of $14.95 since september for audible membership and i have not requested. please reverse there charges. katia paredes published 24 days ago by katia paredes 2.0 out of 5 stars works well but for the 3 books i read/year it ... works well but for the 3 books i read/year it doesn't justify the cost. i'd rather pay for the book outright and not be married to a monthly fee. read more published 27 days ago by kari sherry search customer reviews search these reviews only there's a problem loading this menu right now. learn more about amazon prime. get free unlimited photo storage with amazon prime prime members also enjoy free two-day shipping and exclusive access to music, movies, tv shows, and kindle books. > get started accountorderswish listrecommendationssubscribe & save itemsprime membershipmanage content & devicesprime musicmusic librarycloud drivewatchlistvideo librarygames & software libraryandroid apps & deviceskindle e-readerskindleall-new kindle, now with touchkindle paperwhitefor reading, tablets can't competekindle voyagepassionately crafted for readersaccessoriescovers, chargers, sleeves and morekindle storekindle booksnewsstandkindle unlimitedunlimited reading & listening, $9.99 a monthapps & resourcesfree kindle reading appsfor pc, ipad, iphone, android, and morekindle cloud readerread your kindle books in a browserfire tabletsfire hd 66" -
