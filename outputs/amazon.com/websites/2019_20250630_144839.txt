pageall photosamazon customer5 out of 5 starslove it!ok, let me just say right off the bat that i just received the bot (which is what i named it) today, so i can't comment on quality, longevity, tendency to break down, etc. i just wanted to give my first impressions. over the last couple of years, i've known people who have had roombas and they've been very happy with them. i had been looking to buy one for quite some time, but i wanted to wait until i found one that was affordably priced (imo) while still having some more advanced technology, not too basic. the one i got was the 600 series (the roomba 675), which works with wi-fi and has an app that you can download, whether you have an iphone or a droid. for some reason i was under the impression that it would work with alexa, but it seems i was mistaken. it came in a very sturdy box and included a spare filter, a page with quick setup instructions, and a thankfully short owner's manual in the usual 3 languages, english (i noticed a few typos lol), french, and spanish. i was able to set it up very quickly, basically putting the dock on the floor near an outlet, plugging it in, and putting the bot in the dock. it started charging immediately, although the owner's manual says that it already comes charged and could work right away. anyway, while it sat in the dock charging, i downloaded the app and went through setting up the wi-fi, also a snap. the first time i ran it on my tile floors downstairs, it was because i accidentally pushed the button in the app lol. it found its way around my front room, bumping gently into this and that, not hard enough to damage any of the moldings, paint, furniture, etc. at some point it decided to go back to the dock, probably to charge, and it docked perfectly and started charging. the second time i sent it for another run, i kind of had to encourage it to go into the other room, which it did. after about 15 minutes i ordered it to go back to its dock through the app. it took a little while for it to find its way back to the other room and dock, but again, it went back and docked itself perfectly. the first time it encountered a floor mat by my front door, it backed off, but the second time, it went onto the mat and vacuumed it (yay!) in my kitchen, i have a very ergonomic and cushioned rubber mat near the sink. it had no problem climbing up onto that and vacuuming that (yay!) the owner's manual has excellent information with diagrams, all of the parts being labeled, troubleshooting issues, and maintenance instructions. regarding maintenance, it recommends emptying the bin after each use, cleaning the filter and brushes once a week, cleaning the front caster wheel every 2 weeks, and cleaning the side brush, the cliff sensors, and the charging contacts once a month. i do plan to empty the bin after each use (more on that later), but the rest seems kind of excessive to me, since i'm the only human in the house and i have no pets. i really only plan to use this maybe once a week upstairs and downstairs. i can eyeball the parts and see if they need to be cleaned periodically. regarding maintenance of the various parts, in terms of replacing them, they recommend replacing the filter every 2 months, the brushes every 6 to 12 months, and the front caster wheel every 12 months (not sure why). this also seems kind of frequent to me, so again, i will just monitor their conditions and change them when i feel it's necessary. they have diagrams for how to clean and change all the various parts. one of my friends had a roomba that was so loud it would scare the bejesus out of you if it started up and you weren't expecting it. i would say that mine does not seem to be that loud. to my surprise, when i emptied the dustbin, which was very easy, there was a lot of dirt, hair, and dust. so i'm very satisfied. i did follow the bot around here and there, and watched it pick up things off the floor. i didn't see it leave anything obvious behind, and certainly my floors are cleaner than they were before. i couldn't find any specs, so i took measurements myself (although i guess you can probably find them online). the bot is about 13 inches in diameter and seems to be not even 3 inches high. it had no problem going under most of my furniture, which i'm really happy about because there's always dust under there. little update: i took the bot upstairs, and let him cruise around for a while. it's a mix of carpet and tile. there was a good amount of dust and dirt accumulated in the bin. he did a great job going under the bed, vacuuming various floor mats, navigating door sills, etc. so far so good. all in all, caveat being that this is only the first day, i'm very satisfied with it, and i hope it has a very long, healthy, productive life here!morehidethank you for your feedbackclosesorry, there was an errorclosesorry we couldn't load the reviewtry again top reviews from the united states there was a problem filtering reviews. please reload the page. isaac ingram5.0 out of 5 stars lacks smart features but overall cleans very well reviewed in the united states on february 3, 2025style: q012verified purchase my girlfriend and i purchased this roomba about a month ago for our new apartment that has only hard floors. disclaimer is we have never used this on carpet. we have a cat and we were tired of manually vacuuming up tons of cat hair each week.setup:setup was pretty easy. i just had to put a few parts together, download the app, and connect the robot to the wifi. i did have some issues where it said the wifi password was incorrect even though it wasn't, but after some research i found out that it was because i had special characters in my wifi password. why is this a limitation? no idea, kind of ridiculous but changing my wifi password fixed this problem, and i haven't had any issues since.use:using this vacuum is super easy, you just click the start button on the vacuum or in the app. i also linked it together with homebridge so i'm able to ask siri to start to vacuum as well. you can set up a run schedule in the app, but i set it up (again, through homebridge), so that it runs when neither of us are home. people say that it's loud when it's running, i think this is definitely overstated. it's nowhere near as loud as a normal vacuum. you can still have a conversation while it's running, but it can be annoying at times.results:after about a month of running the roomba every day, we finally decided to sweep the floors and picked up pretty much nothing. it has done a fantastic job of keeping our floors clean of dust, cat litter, cat hair, crumbs, and literally anything else. we find that we have to dump the bin about once a week, which is perfectly okay with us because it takes two seconds to do. when we make a small mess, like dropping something in the kitchen, the spot clean function works pretty well. but considering that you have to go pick up the roomba, set it in the right spot, click "spot clean", leave the area for a bit, and then manually move it back to the home, it just becomes more effort than its worth. at that point, grab a broom.downsides:there are a few downsides to the roomba. the first of which is that it doesn't clean for the first few feet near its home. after about a month, you could tell a difference between the area immediately around the home and everywhere else in the apartment. this is some kind of software limitation that i don't fully understand, but just be aware of this.the second downside is that this roomba has zero idea where it's going, it just bumps into things to map out your home. over time, it seems to learn a bit more about the space and does a better job at navigating, but this is just a sacrifice you have to make at this price point. similarly, this roomba will run over anything. socks, cords, cat toys, it has no idea about its surroundings so sometimes it gets stuck. we just have to check that we didn't leave anything on the floor before we leave the house, because if we did we probably will have to rescue the roomba when we get home. the software does a good job of alerting you when the robot is stuck, but it's still annoying. more expensive models use a camera to avoid obstacles, preventing these issues.and thirdly, this roomba has no support for vacuuming certain rooms or only certain areas. it has to vacuum your entire home in one go or nothing. sometimes i wish i could tell it to vacuum the kitchen after i cook dinner, for example. but again, this is just a sacrifice you make at this pricepoint, and irobot's more expensive models have this feature.overall:for $250 this roomba is totally worth it, but if you can get it on sale like we did (~$150), this roomba is an absolute no-brainer. the lack of obstacle avoidance or ability to specify different rooms or areas to clean is annoying. but that can all be blamed on the fact that we bought the cheapest model that irobot sells, because their more expensive models do have these features. at the end of the day, our apartment is extremely clean without us lifting a finger, and that's what counts. 5 stars for the time and effort this roomba has saved us, even if we have to rescue it every few weeks. read more 32 people found this helpful helpful report df5.0 out of 5 stars changed my life reviewed in the united states on january 15, 2019style: roomba 675verified purchase the irobot 675 has changed my life. i’m a mom to 4 young children living in a 1880 square foot house on a large wooded lot. my kids are outside a lot and track in all kinds of dirt, mud, leaves, grass, etc. my husband, while i love him, is also kind of a mess and has a bad habit of not wiping his shoes and bringing in a ton of sawdust from his projects. on top of all of that, add in the fact that children under 7 really don’t know how to eat properly and drop about seven thousand crumbs per meal per child. our floors, wood, tile, and carpet, have been a disaster for years.enter the roomba. i have been eyeing this little piece of wizardry for years and wondering if this could be the tool that could change my life. i swept and vacuumed (with a dyson dc33) multiple times a day. i was constantly telling guests, “hey sorry about the floor but i think we’re just gross and i can never get on top of it”. well, after finally biting the bullet i regret that i didn’t buy a roomba years ago. i don’t have to apologize to guests and i can finally walk barefoot in my house without having 100 tiny crumbs attaching to the bottom of my feet. i love this thing more than i have ever loved any appliance or cleaning tool i have every owned.about half of our home is our 2 living areas, dining, kitchen, and mud room. the other half are 4 bedrooms and two bathrooms. i have a baby gate dividing the two halves which acts as a barrier that the roomba can’t get through. i really like having that barrier and if i didn’t use that baby gate i probably would have gone with the 690 for the virtual wall but i don’t see a purpose for it for us. i run the roomba every night in our living/eating/kitchen area after we pick up the toys and straighten up the house. this is like magic. i always want to have things picked up and put away but i didn’t always do that before the roomba because we are tired. but i love running the roomba so much that since we have owned this thing we have cleaned up every night since we have owned it. magic. i run the roomba in the bedroom/bathroom areas 2-3 times a week in our house. our kids are a little afraid of it (i want them to be, i don’t want them to touch it, and i may have told them it will bite them) and it does make noise so between all of our napping and sleeping i don’t have as much time to run it back there. i don’t mind though, because the bedrooms do not get nearly as dirty as our living areas.the things i wish i would have known before purchasing:- it really does clean all of the floor. it picks everything up. the crumbs and leaves are gone. it doesn’t miss any part of the floor. i was afraid it would kind of get half of the floor and not the other half because it isn’t as intelligent as the higher trim lines of the roomba. i was wrong. this thing is amazing. i heard from someone else that you shouldn’t watch the roomba because it will just drive you crazy. this is totally true. i watch it and question every move it makes. why did it roll right past that crumb? why is it spending 20 minutes under that couch? just don’t watch it! it so nice to lay in bed at night, tell it to clean from my smart phone, go to sleep, and wake up in the morning to spotless floors!- i have needed to clean out the dust bin after every cleaning. i read a lot of reviews that said once you get into the swing of things with your roomba you only need to clean out the dust bin once or twice a week. that hasn’t been true for us. i’m telling you, we are gross. so if your kids are especially messy or you have really messy pets or track in a lot from being outside that might just be your reality. but that’s fine with me because emptying the dustbin is a lot easier than vacuuming my own floors!- it charges really quickly. i thought i’d be waiting half a day for a charge. not so. ours charges within an hour which is nice because i like to charge in between doing both halves of my house. with as dirty as our floors get i don’t think the roomba could do the entire 1880 square feet on one charge.- unless you really, really want the features the higher end roombas provide you really shouldn’t look at this vacuum as a cheap item. the technology in this thing is awesome (or at least i think it is, i’m not really super techy). this is a great robot that does an amazing job and seems very durable.- it does make noise. my mother in law commented that she was surprised it made noise. it’s a vacuum.- it has changed my life. i am excited to clean my house. i am excited to pick up toys. nothing has ever made me happier about cleaning. this thing is the real deal. i wake up to clean floors every morning and i didn’t do any of the work. get yourself one. read more 1,228 people found this helpful helpful report april4.0 out of 5 stars great roomba easy to setup! reviewed in the united states on may 28,

buen producto y se cumple la relación calidad-precio, su uso es bastante fácil ya que puedes controlarlo desde la misma aspiradora o desde la app, que obviamente la app contiene muchas mas funciones, configurarlo no fue nada del otro mundo y responde al momento, lo que si noté es que hay una ligera "falla" con los comandos de voz, al menos usando google y es que la app de irobot te permite darle un nombre a la aspiradora pero para poder controlarla mediante la voz, solamente responde si la llamas "google" y no con el nombre que tu la hayas nombrado, de ahí en fuera no tengo ningún inconveniente con la app. ahora pasando al tema de funcionamiento les comento que esta barredora cumple su función siempre y cuando le den el tiempo necesario para trabajar, los ciclos de trabajo van desde 15 min hasta 1 hr y media; si lo que quieres es una barrida rápida esta no es una opción ya que si se toma su tiempo para hacer si trabajo, a mi barredora le toma aprox 1 hr limpiar sala, comedor y cocina pero nosotros la dejamos trabajando mientras no estamos en casa, así cuando llegamos ya encontramos todo el piso limpio. read more report translate review to english esmirna
