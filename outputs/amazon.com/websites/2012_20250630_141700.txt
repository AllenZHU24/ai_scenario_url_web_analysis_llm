breakthrough hardware technology when it comes to hd displays, great resolution is just the start. unlike many other tablets, kindle fire hd also delivers rich color and deep contrast from every angle, with an advanced polarizing filter and custom anti-glare technology. high definition touchscreen display rich, immersive, video. beautiful, vivid photos. crisp, detailed text. enjoy your favorite content on a large, beautiful 1920x1200 display, capable of playing movies and tv shows in up to 1080p high definition. at 254 ppi, the display on kindle fire hd 8.9" is high enough quality that individual pixels are indistinguishable to the human eye. the result, an unparalleled viewing experience, no matter what you want to watch. reduced screen glare most tablet displays are made up of two pieces of glass - an lcd on the bottom and a touch sensor on the top, separated by an air gap. with an air gap, light reflects off of every surface as it passes through from the front, creating multiple distracting reflections that reduce display contrast. kindle fire hd solves this air gap problem by laminating the touch sensor and the lcd together into a single layer of glass, creating a display that's easy to view, even in overhead light. richer colors at wider angles like many tablets, kindle fire hd uses in-plane switching (ips) to improve color reproduction. but displays that only use ips still appear washed out at various angles, such as laid sideways when reading in bed, laid flat on a table, or held between you and a friend when sharing a movie. kindle fire hd addresses this issue by applying an advanced polarizing filter directly to the lcd panel. this results in a display that shows the same deep contrast and rich, detailed color when viewed at any angle. low quality sound can ruin your hd entertainment experience. that's why kindle fire hd 8.9" features exclusive, custom dolby audio, dual stereo speakers, and auto-optimization software for clear, crisp, balanced audio. exclusive dolby audio kindle fire hd uses the power of dolby digital plus to create a world class audio experience, with or without headphones. dolby digital plus includes technology used to adjust volume, create virtual surround sound, and deliver easier-to-understand dialogue in movies and tv shows. kindle fire hd is designed to automatically optimize the audio profile based on what you're doing, such as watching a movie, listening to music, or talking on skype. it even optimizes the audio differently when you have headphones plugged in, so you can just sit back and enjoy. powerful dual stereo speakers big sound. compact design. with kindle fire hd 8.9", we put stereo speakers on both sides of the display for a wide stereo sound-field similar to that of a home stereo, then tuned them to better reproduce low notes. the result - deeper bass in your music, loud, rumbling movie soundtracks, and room-filling stereo sound without distortion, even at higher volumes. when it comes to hd content, bandwidth is everything. without it, you get video buffering, slow downloads, and dropped connections. kindle fire hd solves this issue by using state-of-the-art dual-band, dual-antenna wi-fi for over 40% faster speeds. two antennas, better bandwidth kindle fire hd is the first tablet to feature dual wi-fi antennas and multiple in/multiple out (mimo) technology for powerful, hd-ready wi-fi. this allows reception or transmission over both antennas simultaneously to increase capacity and reliability. so you'll enjoy fewer dropped connections, more than 40% faster media streaming, and be able to go further from your wireless hotspot than with other tablets. dual band support many wi-fi devices, from other tablets to baby monitors, only operate in the 2.4 ghz band. the more of these devices that you and your neighbors have operating in the band, the slower your connection is. kindle fire hd is capable of automatically switching between the 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wi-fi frequencies, which will allow you to use this less congested 5 ghz band for better range and less interference. hd content requires more storage, strong processing power, and plenty of battery life. kindle fire hd 8.9" was designed specifically for hd movies and games, giving you lightning fast performance without compromising battery life or storage. powerful hd processor a rich hd display requires a powerful processor to drive it. the ti omap4470 processor in the kindle fire hd 8.9" has 40% more memory bandwidth than tegra 3, enabling faster web browser javascript performance. and kindle fire hd 8.9" has an imagination sgx544 3d graphics core that can process over 12 billion floating-point operations per second, so even graphically intensive games run smoothly and render stunning scenery. we also tuned the graphics pipeline and touch handling software to eliminate delays between when you touch the screen and when the application responds. this means the home screen scrolls more smoothly, videos start playing faster, and games respond nearly instantaneously. plenty of storage for hd content for an hd device, 8gb of storage is not enough. high definition content is substantially larger - for example, on average, an sd movie is 500mb, and an hd movie is 2gb. because of this, kindle fire hd 8.9" offers multiple storage options starting with 16gb, as well as free, unlimited cloud storage for your amazon content. all the content kindle owners' lending library read for free. with prime, kindle owners can borrow any title from the kindle owners' lending

configuration:without special offers| digital storage capacity:16|amazon verified purchase let me start out by saying that i am new to the tablet world and have had no experience using any tablets prior to this purchase. that being said, i spent a great deal of time fishing around through reviews and specs of what seemed like countless tablets for months. the obvious cliche conclusion led to all fingers pointing at some variation of an ipad, yet for me, i do not see much sense in purchasing a tablet (regardless of brand) for around the same price as a cheap yet descent laptop that will have more potential.enter the kindle fire hd.i will spare you the story on my process of how i ended up choosing a fire hd and get right to what you all want to know: my thoughts and experience thus far with the product.picture: (10/10)i will start with this since obviously that was the first thing i noticed. in a word, incredible. now its not "eye popping" or anything out of this world, but i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations and i was (and continue to be) impressed by this piece of hardware's capabilities. i tested out just a few minutes of tv shows, trailers, videos, and films from prime instant video, netflix, hulu plus, flixster, and youtube (through the web browser since an app is currently unavailable) and everything looks as it should (and beautiful to boot)! books come out crisp as well (both in text and picture) and the same goes for basic website visuals, apps, and games. overall i am very impressed.sound: (10/10)this is probably where i was most impressed. i have seen some of the reviews on here that are 3 stars or less putting down the audio or claiming they don't hear the big deal. not to be a jerk or anything but i recommend those people check in at an ear clinic and have their hearing tested. i was literally amazed at how i was hearing sounds from various distances and angles. from up close it felt like i was hearing a high quality home theater system and not just for one flick but everything. from website audio to music, netflix to audiobooks, this tablet sounds great!book/reading features: (10/10)at first this was not my primary reason for purchasing a fire hd, but after toying around with a few things, i am truly impressed at how well amazon has integrated the ability to find, purchase, read, and even listen to literature. the lending library for prime users is a nice added touch allowing you to borrow from a rather extensive list of books. not to mention many timeless classics are available for free (such as dracula, gulliver's travels, little women, the iliad, the jungle book and many more) and of those titles, many come with free audio! if you do not feel like spending the money on audio (or if your book has none available) the text-to-speech feature is surprisingly well done with minimal error. with all this being said, i can honestly say that i am excited to start reading again.web browsing: (8/10)the only reason i do not give this a 10 is because web browsing (with what is given out of the box) lacks flash support which limits the capabilities. however, with a bit of research i was able to find forum discussions on how fire hd users were able to work around this by downloading an app called es file explorer and then a separate browser called dolphin that gives you flash capabilities, so this is an easy fix that even a monkey could figure out how to do as long as they are patient. though don't get me wrong, silk is fast and beautiful and i use it for the majority of my web surfing, but occasionally flash is needed. as i am sure you have read by now in other reviews, the fact that the fire hd does not automatically come with flash support is not amazon's fault yet rather adobe for pulling he plug on their involvement with tablets. again, as long as your network is put together well, browsing the web is very fast and up to par with dare i say some computers.app availability: (8/10)to me, this is the only area where the fire hd lacks. i would rate lower here but i am trusting that over time and after updates, the lineup will have grown. once more, with a bit of research you can find discussions on how to "sideload" apps from your computer and other devices, but that could be a bit too advanced for the average user. though for what it is worth, the selection it does currently come with is top notch. just to name a few, some important missing apps include: youtube, dropbox, and siriusxm. still, as far as i am concerned, this certainly is not a deal breaker and i am sure that as things progress access to these will become available.look/feel: (10/10)the 8.9" model that i own and am currently reviewing was a lot lighter than i expected and it is true what they say ( it is just right to fit in one hand). out of the box/pre-case the fire hd looks great and is very thin, sleek, and dare i say...sexy? the only minor gripe i would have (that i noticed other reviewers mentioned) is the volume and power buttons are sometimes hard to find and do not always register, but after a while you get use to it. aside from that, i love how it appears and functions.overall: (56/60)there are a few things that by now you may know, such as how out of the box the fire hd does not come with a wall charger. i know that is a bummer but if you don't already have one roaming around your house from a smartphone or if you cannot tolerate simply charging from your computer, amazon sells them at a fairly reasonable price.bottom line? i have purchased over 500 items on amazon and i rarely feel the need to review a product, but i genuinely felt my voice needed to be heard ( or read rather) with the kindle fire hd 8.9. i strongly recommend purchasing this product and if you have any questions, feel free to comment and hopefully either me or someone else can assist you!p.s. this took me forever to type on the fire hd but it was good practice and hopefully worth it!i would highly recommend a screen protector and a case 40 comments | was this review helpful to you? yes no 1,865 of 1,911 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars excellent value and great gadget november 24, 2012 by michael gallagher hall of fametop 10 reviewervine™ voice configuration:with special offers| digital storage capacity:64|amazon verified purchase as there appears to be mixed reviews of the 8.9' fires - ones with 4g access and those without - to clarify, this review is for the 8.9" tablet with the 4g connectivity option.in comparing this larger hd fire to the "regular" hd fire, this one wins hands down. why? despite what some people may say, size matters and the display of game apps and video is clearly superior. the added functionality of 4g access for just $50 for the year, which doesn't include the $10 app gift card amazon gives you for signing up, is one heck of a money saver compared to the same charges at&t has for an ipad user. granted, 250 mb is a lot less than 2gb, but with wifi just about everywhere that isn't a constraint for my uses. just make sure you don't have a lot of apps open and running in the background (which seem to hit the internet a lot and chew up your data plan), or you may find this 250 mb limit will be chewed up pretty fast.to get the ipad comparison out of the way, i put this tablet side-by-side to my ipad 2 i use for work. downloads were slightly faster and the video screen resolution and the colors were more vibrant on the fire vs. the ipad 2.screen display / video playback:with the larger hd screen, if playing video is important to you this is the version of the fire to get as the screen display is fairly impressive with sharp and crisp colors. the display on this hd fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model and even this year's smaller hd model.amazon also added a cool feature on this one with the hdmi micro connection port. i have an hdmi micro plug and was able to hook this up to the big screen to watch an episode of the science fiction series defying gravity. it played back great smoothly with no problems.wi-fi connectivity:my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi-fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. in this comparison, i had this 8.9" version of the fire sitting next to the "smaller" hd version of the fire, my motorola razr smartphone, my ipad 2 (yes, the kindle guy uses an ipad for work), and the new 7" fire all just using a wi-fi connection vs. cellular connectivity..my website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews, cnn, my personalized yahoo page, google, and the houston chronicle. the ones that were usually slow on the other devices and were still slow but faster than the other devices (houston chronicle and cnn), and for the other sites i couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. when i went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was slightly faster but for a casual surfer it is not noticeable nor does it hang.email setup:email setup was very easy with the included email app for my main google account - it took about a minute to input my email address and password information and i was good to go: sending and receiving emails was a snap, and when i sent a test message with pictures they displayed crisply. i will tell you i primarily us an existing app called enhanced email that i received here on the amazon app store for free vs. what came as standard with the fire for daily use, and it was easy to use - actually better due to the larger screen size - with this version of the fire. for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program, the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don't like getting out of the lazy chair once i'm settled in!game play:i do play a lot of games, but they aren't the heavy action / interactive games many of the kids play today. for my test, i tried out several rounds of words with friends and a majong derivative. the display was crisp and the tablet was very responsive as it interacted over the wifi network of my home to the game server.sound / music playbackdifferent than last year's model and the $159 this year's model, the two speakers are located in the back of the kindle fire in two not-noticeable ports. my test of this feature was cranking up van halen's panama to maximum volume (i wanted to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. however, the sound is not very crisp (the $159 fire sounds better to me) as the sound is going away from you with the speakers being in the back. with a cover on the fire to protect it, that can be a problem. it's going to take a little bit of getting used to having the volume controls at the top of the device.reading books:reading a book was enjoyable and easy on the eyes with the larger screen: i appreciate being able to changing the default font to something else in addition to increasing the font size so i don't have to wear my glasses. turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.bluetooth:bluetooth setup was very easy. i tested this with audio in my car as well as an external keyboard. from a music standpoint, there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about 30 seconds; i hooked up a motorola bluetooth keyboard and started banging away with several emails. just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.affordability vs. an ipaddollarwise, this version of the fire whips the ipad when you stack up the annual cost of connectivity, 64gb of memory, and the cellular (or not) models of the ipad. the ipad's screen is slightly larger, but when i put it up against each other for the same things (web page, game app) i really couldn't tell that much of a difference.overall, if you are looking for a larger tablet this one wins hands down. with the full-features included with this model - especially the 4g connection - i believe this will be my go-to device, and i will no longer be carrying my e-ink kindle in addition to my ipad every day. 101 comments | was this review helpful to you? yes no 2,033 of 2,107 people found the following review helpful 3.0 out of 5 stars not the greatest tablet, but a good one november 16, 2012 by d. carlson i wasn't really in the market for another tablet, but my girlfriend ended up getting one for me so she got me on this one. i would like to say that this tablet reminds me of the first motorola droid smartphone that came out several years back. the phone jam packed a ton of bells & whistles into its hardware and software to give a lot of bang for your buck. this is what it feels like amazon has done with the kindle fire 8.9. they have put a lot of advanced hardware and innovative software, so for the average user, specially someone who absorbs a lot of media, you get a lot for the price. but just because you get a lot for the price, doesn't mean it is without its flaws. this is an updated version of my likes and dislikes, (my original analysis was a bit rushed, this is more detailed):likesbuild qualityi like the build of this product, it has good material design and durability. it feels nice in your hands and comfortable to hold with easy access to buttons. since this is only 8.9" and not 10 or 11 inches, it is easier to grasp and hold in one hand with an overall good aesthetic look and feel to it.speakersi have to say, the more i listen to it, the more i like the sound. the speakers are definitely a step up from the norm and probably one of its best features. they produce a full, rich, and very vibrant sound you can experience music and movies the way they were meant to be experienced. it is not a home theatre experience, but as close as one can get with a small device like this.screenthe display is very nice. i'm not sure if it compares with the clarity of super amoled or retina screens, but it comes close. high screen resolution is not special to the kindle, lots of tablets now have high resolution screens, some higher. what this screen has that other tablets don't is the anti-glare, which works well under sunlight and highly lit places, it's not something that seems advantageous until you work with a screen that doesn't have this.internetkindle's wi-fi and silk browser make internet browsing fast. i did a comparison with a samsung and apple tablet, and noticed that the surfing was faster, it wasn't a huge difference but it was noticeable. streaming audio and video had a bigger and more noticeable difference, with the kindle being very smooth, with fewer lags and dropped connections. this is key for me, i hate streaming content with pauses and breaks in loading, there is less of that in the fire.reading experiencein my opinion, this is fire hd's best feature, delivering a better reading experience than any tablet right now. this is no surprise as books are amazon's claim to fame and where they excel and have always excelled. i don't know if you remember, but before amazon was amazon, they were the first online retailer for books. before there was an ipad, there was the kindle. they have always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience, now especially digital books. i think i remember reading that the kindle was the main reason borders bookstore went out of business, borders said they just couldn't keep up with or match amazon's delivery system.now with this fire hd, they offer even more advancements. with its x-ray for books, its 'reading view' that takes away messy images on a site leaving only text, `immersive' reading that lets you play an audio book while reading, whispersync technology, and better optimization of text, other devices can't match. granted it doesn't compare to digital ink like on the original kindle for me did the best to mimic actual reading, but as far as tablets goes its better than what is out there. if you are getting a tablet primarily for reading, this is gonna be a good choice.amazon universei have a love hate relationship with amazon's universe of services. i don't like how even though the kindle hd uses android, it is somewhat restricted. also, they don't have as many apps as google or apple. but taking everything else into account, movies, books, music, prime lending library, prime movies, amazon is better. the big drawback is you have to own a kindle to fully enjoy their universe, which means if you own a kindle, you are limited from using other company's universe.apps and other featuresall the apps work fine, they start and stop as they should, nothing to criticize or brag about. the touch screen is smooth and responds good, though nothing like ipad...hate to say it but ipad thumps everyone on that, their touch and scrolling is very fluid and just feels right. i don't have kids so i can't really comment on the parental controls but from other reviews seems like something to have if you have kids. can access email and everything fine.dislikeswhen it comes to bringing together the right mix of original and developing technology in a tablet, like the first droid phone, amazon did an admirable job. it merged a mix that most of us will enjoy and find useful. although amazon has put original elements that make this tablet worthy to compete in the tablet world, at the same time, they've done some things that make you question what they're doing.adsthis is the most disliked innovation to hit electronics since the windows phone (and i don't mean the windows 7 phone, i mean its predecessor, which was so disastrous nobody heard about its release and was pulled from shelves within two weeks). microsoft was smart enough to pull its mistake, amazon seems to continue to run with theirs.no chargeras you have read in other reviews, this product does not come with a standard charger. i don't like that other reviewers excuse this by claiming it makes the product cheaper. chargers are not expensive to produce so i don't think it makes the product cheaper, it gives amazon more opportunity to recover the kindle cost by charging $20+ dollars for an accessory that probably only costs a few dollars to make. not sure how accurate this is, it's my own decision i've reached as it doesn't make sense not to include a standard charger adapter because for most people including myself, this is not a pc companion, rather a pc replacement. without a real charger, it becomes a companion. yes, you can buy one, but why make us do that.camerathe kindle fire 8.9 only has a front facing camera. it is useful for video chatting, but not for taking pictures. if i want to take a picture of something outside myself, i have to point the screen in that direction, which means i can't see what i am taking a picture of or have easy access to the camera buttons, doesn't make sense.this is some of the qualms i have, nothing revolting.all in all, do i like this kindle hd? yes. will i keep it? probably. do i think it is the greatest tablet in the world? in some respects, yes, in others no. should you buy it? the answer is this is not an all-in-one, do everything machine that the likes of ipad claim to be. with this it seems like amazon focused on some key things, like watching movies, listening to music, surfing the internet, and reading books. the things they concentrated on, they made sure to go full force to give users the best experience they could. they are things that most of us average users are going to use a tablet for...email, streaming, social media, video, music, for what amazon focused on with this product like i said they did admirably. 139 comments | was this review helpful
