giving back aldo places a premium on being a good corporate citizen by working to enrich the communities in which we live and work. it's not uncommon for aldo or its employees to participate in fundraisers or to volunteer their time to community causes. aldo is a brand with a conscience, a brand that cares. we actively support the fight against aids. giving back to our communities is a necessary and fundamental part of the work we do everyday. dans la rue once again, during the holiday season, the aldo group prepared 500 backpacks, which were distributed to dans la rue, an organization that helps youth living on the streets of montreal. over 18,000 items, including backpacks, treats, snacks, personal hygiene products and warm accessories were collected or purchased for the cause! 60 volunteers from all of the aldo group's divisions generously donated their time to help out with the packaging of these items, which went directly to street kids. since its creation in 1988, dans la rue is a safe place for these kids to go and a place for them to grow. they can find resources that have been tailored to their individual circumstances. but above all, they can draw on an unending source of respect, friendship and encouragement. aldo fights aids aldo has been involved with the fight against aids since 1985, a time when the cause carried with it an unfortunate stigma. over the years, aldo has committed millions of dollars to aids awareness and research organizations, including canfar, amfar and youthaids. in fall 2005 and summer 2006 aldo took a stand with the launch of the aldo fights aids campaign, an effort that demonstrates an ongoing commitment to this important cause. amongst the diverse and talented group of celebrities from both the big-screen and music industry elite who donated their time and energy to the campaign are some of today's most influential celebrities: ludacris, charlize theron, michelle yeoh, pink, avril lavigne, christina aguilera, and the list goes on! the campaign used a powerful combination of top celebrities and multiple media genres to communicate real facts associated with the disease. as part of the campaign, aldo designed a series of limited-edition empowerment tags that were sold in-stores and online at www.youthaids-aldo.org. with 100% of net proceeds benefiting youthaids programs worldwide, the simple act of buying one empowerment tag for only $5 helps to educate and protect a young person from hiv/aids for 6 months. together with you, our customer, aldo is making a difference... sign up and get 10% off: order by phone: 1-888-818-2536 find a store about aldo shipping & delivery return policy careers contact us privacy policy legal notice sitemap shop our brands:aldocall it spring © 2005-2011. aldo group inc. all rights reserved.
