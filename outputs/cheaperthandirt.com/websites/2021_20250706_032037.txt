short list, and for good reason. in recent years the ar has become america’s most popular rifle because of its adaptability, parts availability, and reliability. shooters all over the country turn to the ar platform for all kinds of uses like home defense, competitive shooting, hunting, and even use on the ranch as a truck gun. features the ar-15 is available with a direct impingement gas system also known as "di"or a gas piston, depending on your personal preference. the di gas system is battle proven to work in the most adverse conditions, but some shooters take that reliability to the next level by installing a gas piston system that mimics the legendary ak-47. the modular design of ar rifles will allow you to add as many accessories as you could possibly want like rail systems, after-market stocks, red-dot sights, or even a set of high-quality iron sights for the traditionalist. the sky is the limit when you are customizing your new ar-15. configuration the ar-15 rifle is available in hundreds of configurations to suit every need. ultra-compact pistol uppers allow you to get an ar pistol built out or you could even spend that $200 with the atf to register a short barrel rifle (a rifle with a barrel under the 16-inch limit). rifle, mid-length, carbine, and pistol gas systems allow you to configure your rifle to fit your needs perfectly. the shorter the gas system, the more reliable when dirty, but the longer the gas system, the softer shooting it is going to be. bestselling ar-15 rifles quickview del-ton sport mod 2 ar-15 semi auto rifle 5.56mm nato 16"

ar-15 eugene stoner designed the armalite ar-10 rifle to replace the m14 with a lighter and more accurate design that was more reliable in wet and muddy conditions. after the us military saw the rifle they did some research and came to the conclusion that the next us service rifle needed to have a very fast moving and accurate projectile. mr. stoner scaled down the ar-10 and chambered the rifle in 5.56 x 45mm or .223 remington as a result of the military’s request. the ar-15 was born and morphed from the original designation of ar-15(ar stands for armalite rifle) to the m16, and then to the m16a1, where it served in the vietnam war. the m16a1 became the m16a2, and then was followed by the m4 carbine. overall the ar-15 platform has been serving american citizens since 1961 and will continue to do so for many decades. what's new quickview winchester usa 5.56 nato ammunition 20 rounds fmj 55 grains wm193k winchester usa 5.56 nato ammunition 20 rounds fmj ... 5.0 our low price
