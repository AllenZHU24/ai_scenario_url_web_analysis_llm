interested range hoods kitchen range hoods are important for keeping your home clean and fresh. the main function of a range hood is to remove cooking odors, smoke, heat and steam from the kitchen. another function is to collect grease and grime so they will not build up in your home. venting range hoods remove the odors and smoke through a duct to the outside. recirculating range hoods do not have a duct and the air is filtered and returned clean back inside. wall mounted range hoods attach to the kitchen wall and vents through the ceiling. island range hoods are installed above an island cook-top. under cabinet range hoods are the most popular and the easiest to install, they sit under the cabinets above the cook-top. you can find your next kitchen range hood by using the filters to the left to browse by brand, size, speed, material and more. items 1 to 24 of 113 view as grid list gallery sort by position name price availability set descending direction show 24 36 48 96 all per
