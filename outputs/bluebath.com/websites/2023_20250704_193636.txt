most apron front sinks otherwise known as farm sinks require undermount installation. laminate countertops are not recommended for use with undermount installation because water can potentially get inside the laminate and cause warping. the best countertop type for farm sinks is solid surface such as granite. that being said we have had customers who had no other choice on countertop and just had to have a farm sink so they did make it work. it's possible, check with your installer for more information. what does dual flush mean?
