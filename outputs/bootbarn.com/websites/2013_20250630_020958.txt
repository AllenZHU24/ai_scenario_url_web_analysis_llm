currently we do not have this feature online. sorry about that, but we're working on it. at boot barn, we want you to know how much we appreciate your business. join b rewarded today and we’ll give you 100 points – free. simply enroll in b rewarded and you’ll receive 50 points. then provide us your email address while in one of our stores and you’ll receive an extra 50 points! to enroll in the program just stop by any boot barn® store location and fill out an enrollment form. it's that easy! note: we're sorry, but at this time the boot barn® rewards program does not apply to purchases made on bootbarn.com. this means you will not earn any points for purchases made on bootbarn.com nor can you use rewards credits for purchases on bootbarn.com. membership the b rewarded program is open to individuals who are at least 18 years of age and residents of the united states. commercial customers and others purchasing items for resale are not eligible for membership. employees and members of

members earn 1 point for every dollar spent on merchandise or services. fractional purchases are rounded to the next closest dollar. for example, $1.49 earns 1 point, where $1.50 earns 2 points. customers who are “gold” members earn an additional 10% bonus points—thus a $10 purchase earns 11 points. for transactions where the amount is between $50.00 and $99.99, members will earn an additional 10% bonus points. transactions that are $100.00 or more earn an additional 25% bonus points. when reward credit is used, no points will be earned on the credit amount of the transaction. points will not be awarded for sales tax, shipping charges, fees or other excluded charges, or on the purchase of boot barn® gift cards. points earned on items that are later returned will be deducted from your account and any corresponding reward credit may be invalidated. reward points earned on purchases made by the account holder only. purchases made by anyone other than the actual account holder will not be added to the account. points from purchases made by individuals living at the same household address may be applied to one account if all individuals are listed on the account. accounts cannot be created using fictitious information or using personal information belonging to individuals other than the applicant. spouses and family members within the same household may be added if they are present during the application. points have no cash value and are nontransferable or exchangeable unless specifically authorized by boot barn®. rewards members earn a $15 reward credit on future purchases for every 250 points earned. there are no limits to the number of reward credits that can be earned in a given year. once 250 points have been earned, the member will be notified via email within 14 days that they have a $15 reward credit. members may use the credit when purchasing a minimum of $20 of merchandise within 60 days of the date of the email notice. reward
