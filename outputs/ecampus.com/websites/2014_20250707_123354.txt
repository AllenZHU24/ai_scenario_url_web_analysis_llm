and most convenient way to get a textbook into the hands of a college student? to answer that question, a group of people began a series of meetings on january 20, 1999 and ecampus.com was born. the more we talked the more we came up with new ideas for service and convenience. by february 1st we were writing code - including code for what we think was the first "traveling book bag" on the internet. we incorporated on april 16, 1999 and began to move into our headquarters. ecampus.com officially went live at approximately 11:20 am, friday, july 2, 1999. as the site grew in scope and capability others joined us. development teams emerged. designs and ideas were discussed, developed and adopted. on july 18, 2001, ecampus.com experienced a "re-birth" when a book company, llc, purchased the ecampus.com name and domain. our commitment is as strong as ever to provide our customers with affordable textbooks and stuff - perhaps while having a little fun along the way. today, ecampus.com is a fully operational e-commerce business designed to provide the highest-quality products and services to students and campus communities wherever they happen to be. ecampus.com now offers the absolute widest online selection of textbook alternatives including purchasing new, used and digital textbooks from ecampus.com directly; buying from sellers on our student marketplace, or simply renting your textbooks for the semester. of course, the history of ecampus.com will never be fully written because our web-store will never be completely finished. we constantly improve the way our site works and the services and merchandise we can provide. investor relations ecampus.com is a subsidiary of a book company, llc, a privately-owned company founded in 2001. for additional
