customer satisfaction feedback "the printer arrived today, the whole experience of purchasing from you went seamlessly. the printer is installed, the first pages printed. your price was the best i could find. given i only ordered, i think last friday, delivery was excellent and even given the delivery charge the price still came in under others and not a hiccup in the whole process. many thanks from a satisfied customer." james falls church, va "i am proud to say that you have earned yet another satisfied, and promising returning customer. prior to ordering my cpu, i was quite skeptical to the whole internet-purchasing situation. i have never ordered anything off the internet before, and i have to admit, even after reading all of your wonderful thank-you letters from satisfied customers, i was still a tad-bit nervous. although, your service has proved me wrong. i am not sure if all internet company's work as swiftly, and keep me as informed as yours, but i must say; i am quite satisfied. i placed my order on monday, and it was processed in less than 2 days. two short days later, my brand-spankin new cpu arrived at my doorstep, for $80 cheaper than even i could purchase it for (and i have employee discounts at comp usa). i would just like to say thank you to everyone at compuplus, for making my experience much more enjoyable than i could ever have imagined. i look forward to doing business with you again, soon. sincerely, soon-to-be-returning-customer," jonathan "i have never written an appreciation letter to internet shopping site before, but my experience with your company has been the best i've had in my 8 years of doing business on the internet. i ordered my mp3 player sunday night and i am listening to a brand new, undamaged, nonrefurbished player - as i write this on wednesday afternoon in california. in fact, if fedex would not have sat on it for 14 hours at my local sort facility, i could have received yesterday! your ordering service and tracking number response has to be the best in the industry. i can't remember ever getting a tracking number within 12 hours of ordering. and your expedited shipping is what it says it is, expedited. i have used mpsuperstore and j&r music world and have been highly disappointed, now i know that an east coast company can properly service west coast customers. believe me you have a future customer for a long time to come. and i will strongly recommend your company to my friends and co-workers." john bruneel livermore, ca "i want you to know that after ordering 2 items from your company over the past couple of months, you guys take the prize of being the most efficient and "up to speed - all bases covered" company around. i cannot tell you enough what it means to be a customer who is recognized and valued, and kept abreast of the progress of one's order. keep up the good work! you have won yourself a loyal customer who will be returning often in the future, as i buy nearly everything but groceries online. you are the best, with a second runner up of amazon.com! thanks again" phil johannes "just a quick note to say "thanks" for the positive online buying experience from you folks. your products, prices, and delivery were all as advertised - can't do much better than that. - but you did! i had a problem with one of the items i bought. you handled the rma request promptly and without any hassle. got the replacement within just a few days." john lathan brooklyn park, mn "hi compuplus guys, i just wanted to tell you that my first order from you guys was nothing less than the best! the internet order was very smooth and painless! the ability to pay by bank debit was extremely useful! the order confirmation with the order # was excellent. the email you sent me with delivery information was fast and informative! and best of all was the speed in which i received my order just made my day! your choice in delivery service (fedex) shows that you care about your customers! thanks you so very much for such a good ordering experience!" jimmy benfield brown summit, nc "i would just like to thank you company for the superior service i have recieved. for one, each email that has been sent from you has been of the highest quality, expressing deep concern for my satisfaction as a customer. i am highly appreciative of this attitude, as it seems to be quite rare these days. the price for the item i purchased was the lowest on the web, and it was shipped to me promptly after ordering. unfortunately, my merchandise did not behave as expected although i would have loved to have kept it. on the bright side, the return process i went through was the easiest i have ever experienced. your return system is easily navigated, clear to understand and completely hassle free. an email was sent to me and my credit card was refunded promptly only days after i sent the package with my item. i can't thank you enough for your attention to me as a customer. please keep delivering this superior customer service experience to everyone, and thank you! i will remember the name comp-u-plus when considering making computer parts or electronic purchases in the future!" dean langford spokane, wa "i've been buying & building computers for a dozen years & i have found that buying computer parts from internet suppliers is the best way to buy. by far, your company provides the best prices & services of any supplier on the internet & i will only buy from you for all my future needs, without even bother to check prices elsewhere". jack allan palm desert, ca "comp-u-plus processed and shipped the order in such a speedy manner that i received the 2day fedex in a day and a half. wow! the product i ordered came shrink wrapped in its retail package, so i know i am not getting someone elses return. all in all, this turned out to be a great online purchase experience!" robert dillon costa mesa, ca "it was a great experience shopping on line for the first time. so much that i plan on making most if not all of my purchase needs online. thank you for a wonderful first time shopping online." marque smith burbank, ca "let me say first of all that i heard horror stories about one ordering from the internet and how companies and people from your area rip people off. well let me tell you  nothing could be further from the truth... my husband and i have never had better service than the service you provided us with and the accuracy and fast delivery of the products we ordered from you. we were so amazed how quickly we received our order.  also, how you emailed us  informing us that our product was sent out to us and when to expect delivery and also the tracking of such. we want to let those out there seeking on the internet and wondering who they can trust with the best buys for their monies and for the honesty of a company that serves its customers in a fast and direct manor.  we would indeed use you and when ordering again for all our electronic needs and products, (cameras. etc) we would choose comp u plus.  you have earned our respect and trust.  it was indeed nice doing business with you. we want the whole world to know of you. and your promptness. respectfully." karl and mary lou kent, ohio "i want to thank you for the excellent service i have received from your company. i am well satisfied with everything so-far and will write good reviews for you wherever i can. i ordered a digital camera from you, got a good price, got a fair shipping rate and got it with no hassle - which i can't say for amazon.com & buy.com whom i struggled with for over two weeks before ordering from you. i will definitely do business with you again!" gene glaser orange beach, al "i am writing to let you know that i am very pleased with the service that you have given me. i had placed two orders early saturday morning. i came home from work today and found my orders waiting for me. i had not expected them so fast. i appreciate the quickness with which you processed my order. i am a first time customer of your website and i am sure that i will be returning to your site for my future computer needs. thank you very much." tom pinero philadelphia, pa "i recently ordered a modem from you. your web-site is clear, concise, and easy to use. i received confirmation of my order within moments; i received confirmation of shipping the same day. your tracking number which took me directly to the ups page tracking the exact shipment, instead of pasting the number into the ups track page, is great! the package arrived exactly when you said it would, and to top it all off, your price was better than any other on the web. it's a real pleasure to deal with excellence!" b.r. tucson, az "i just wanted to thank you for the great customer service, and very quick response. when shopping over the internet, the main thing shoppers look for is price....we want good value. but one thing that is beyond monetary value is customer service. you guys did a good job on both! my transaction was so smooth and quick -it was truly a pleasure. plus, i got a really good deal on the video card!" thanks again. t.h. "i just had to let you know how much i appreciate such great service! customer service is a major priority in all my purchasing decisions, expecially online. while service seems to have taken a back seat by many organizations in recent years, it is alive and thriving in your company! i have placed three orders with comp-u-plus and have been really thrilled by the prices, the follow-up e-mail (including tracking numbers), the quick shipping, and your "no hassle" return policy. i have also recommended your company to my father, who has received similar service. i will continue to recommend comp-u-plus to everyone who may be interested in purchasing computer equipment!" thank you! c. h. "i'd just like to take the time to tell you how happy i am with your company. i ordered over $600 worth of computer products a few days ago and received them promptly and in excellent condition. your prices are excellent and your service is wonderful. thank you very much!" d.h.

"i wanted to drop you a note to let you know how much i appreciated your help with my order issues yesterday. i deal with many computer companies regurlarly, and it is rare that i receive such genuine and attentive customer service. as a retailer myself, i recognize that this is the key to customer loyalty. thank you again for your help!" h.m. "wow! talk about speedy service! i just ordered a motorola cable modem and have received ideal service. i ordered on wednesday, it arrived friday! the price was low! i got a $30.00 rebate! i will definitely look to you guys first for all future computer related purchases! thanks," b. w. "i wanted to take time to let you guys know that i understand you are in a nearly thankless industry. the only thing people care about is buying it cheap and getting instant gratification. your capability to handle this type of consumer mentality is exceptional! your service is great, your prices nearly unbeatable, and your shipping very reliable and fast. i've been ordering from you guys for several years now, and probably spent over $5,000, maybe $10,000 in the process. i build machines all the time for myself, friends and family. whenever anyone asks where to buy components, i refer them to you. there may be a few cheaper prices on the web, but not many. even if i find them, i still order from you because you have proven yourself time and again to be an excellent company in terms of service, honesty, and efficiency. keep up the good work and i'll bring as much business as i possibly can to your door! hardware enthusiast and consumer," b. p. "wow, you guys are fast, i palced an order late sunday night and it shipped with a tracking number on monday afternoon! you just got a regular customer! thanks" r. g. "in a saturated market of computer resellers, i just wanted to take the time to let you guys know that i think you're excellent! your service is unparalleled, your speed unmatched, and your prices unbeatable. i've been buying components from you guys for years now,.and i've never had to return but one component. that one return went quickly and smoothly with minimal hassle. whenever i build machines for anyone, or people come and ask me where to buy parts, i always recommend you first. i hope you have a long life in this turbulent industry. a pat on the back to all of you! another satisfied customer," b. p.
