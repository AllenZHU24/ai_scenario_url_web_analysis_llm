this is a d fit in our women's shoes and a g fit in our men's shoes. however, if your big toe joint/small toes begin to feel pinched or ache, then you may need to try a wider fit. i have slim feet. which styles would suit me? people with slim feet and a low instep/arch may benefit from the use of an insock or inner sole to help reduce the excess volume inside the shoe. this can be particularly beneficial for ladies wishing to wear shoes with no effective fastening such as a court shoe. i have a high instep. which styles would suit me best? styles which are low cut on the front, and do not cover your instep are a good place to start, like loafers. if you prefer a style with more foot coverage, then try a style with some adjustability so you can loosen the lace/buckle. pull on boots and mule type styles are likely to give issues with foot entry. i have a high arch - which styles will suit me best? try to select a style with a reasonably high cut and avoid styles with low waists such as low-slung ballerina styles and some court shoes as these will tend to gape. i have low ankle bones and the toplines rub. what can i do? try adding a half insock, this will help to raise the foot slightly in the back of the shoe and raise it off the topline. i love high heels, but they make the arches of my foot ache. what can i do? wedges or platform shoes can offer the height of a heel but with less of an ache in the arch of the foot. the substance of the sole in the forepart means that the arch of the foot is cranked at much less of an angle and thus aches less. i have wider calves, which size boot/leg do i select? women with fuller calves should generally select wide leg boots with an 'e' fitting, as these have a wide leg. each whole size has a circumference that is approx. 10mm wider. on an 'e' fitting of the same size, it will be 50mm wider at the top of the leg, then 40mm wider at the lower leg blending in at the ankle. categories of interest all womens shoes all mens shoes all girls shoes all boys shoes womens wide fit mens wide fit all originals styles scroll to topcontact us email address clarks newsletter > join our list x departments womens mens bostonian kids originals discover sale help customer service shipping & delivery order lookup returns compare at pricing faqs id.me faqs in-store rewards program terms in-store rewards program faqs shoe care guide about clarks careers technologies about us affiliate program corporate responsibility california supply chains act california -
