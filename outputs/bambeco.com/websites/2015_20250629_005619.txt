birthday present and she loved it. it took me 10 minutes and left all the important decision-making to her. she got lots of great stuff that's good for the planet and said it was a lot of fun to shop for it. now i'm back for another one. i have a feeling i'll be on bambeco.com a lot in future! submit a review questions & answers ask a question question: does this mean that you don't have/offer 'plastic' gift cards? not everyone has internet access, believe it or not! i would prefer to give someone a 'plastic' gift card inside their birthday card, as opposed to them receiving it electronically via email, without the birthday card that i've selected for them. answer: we do not offer plastic gift cards. you may order a bambeco gift card (emailed to yourself), print it, and place it it a paper birthday card. the recipient will be able to use the gift card number on our site. provide your input question: i have another question regarding your gift cards. if the recipient does not use the entire amount on the gift card for one purchase, is there an expiration on the remaining balance on the card? answer: bambeco gift cards are valid for one year from purchase date.
