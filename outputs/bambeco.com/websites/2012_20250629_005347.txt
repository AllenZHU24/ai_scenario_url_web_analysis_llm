blossom shower curtain rated by: jesica lob on 10/19/2012 6:30:00 am title: awesome i like this curtain. the design on fabric suites the bathroom environment. http://www.thertastore.com santa fe/chelsea dining collection rated by: jesica lob on 10/19/2012 2:02:00 am title: a royal dining a good quality dining set. bamboo made things are durable and echo friendly. http://www.thertastore.com la fortuna hummingbird feeder tall rated by: susan larson on 10/18/2012 8:15:00 pm title: beautiful humming bird feeder and doubles as a piece of art what a pretty hummingbird feeder! it is made of durable handblown glass (it reminds me of the glasses hand made in mexico) the glass is very colorful and has a bumpy texture that give it an artsy look. it looks beautiful hanging in my garden. metal circle side table rated by: barry on 10/1/2012 8:06:00 pm title: the online pic doesn't do this table justice. this is a great, very well made, small side table. the brass welds give it a real stylish pop. love it. capiz eco leaf plates set of 4 rated by: roxanne on 9/18/2012 8:54:00 am title: delicate and pretty i got these for my retro mad men party, and i was surprised at how strong they actually are. they look and feel so delicate, and the capiz shells are so retro chic. i like using these to set out cheese selections. butri serving trio rated by: roxanne on 9/18/2012 8:47:00 am title: retro and eco! i got the avocado color to use for a mad men party and these were so cool! the retro style was just right for the party, but it's so cool i'm using it for every day. i love the mango wood, it feels so smooth and the dishes are a great size for dips or nuts. solar tea lanterns rated by: sng on 9/3/2012 9:29:00 am title: love these solars. they are beautiful pieces even without the solar component. it holds it's charge for at least 2-3 nights. as i have put it under a canopy with minimal direct sunlight. i loove it. totally my fault. i broke my saffron piece 1 day after arrival by not screwing on top properly and carrying it by handle. but the solar part is still working and i put it on another bottle but definitely not as pretty. moss terrarium bottle rated by: amie b on 8/24/2012 9:46:00 am title: ready to go out of the box! this is the perfect terrarium for someone impatient! the plants are already grown, just rehydrate and it's ready to go. i love that the chopsticks tool doubles as the stand (no worrying about where to store the tool, it's always right there). i made mine into a mini-garden with tiny flowers and accessories from an old doll house. it's so cute sitting on my desk! jersey sheet set rated by: amie b on 8/24/2012 9:40:00 am title: like your favorite tee these really are like sleeping in a well-worn tee shirt. they're so soft and comfy! they've been perfect for summer, no blanket needed and i'm betting they'll be even better when the weather cools down. the only downside is you won't want to get out of bed, these sheets are so comfy. eco flex ruled journal clementine rated by: amie b on 8/24/2012 9:37:00 am title: great to carry with i carry a notebook instead of a planner so this was perfect. it has a little pocket in the back that i use to hold receipts and business cards and stuff like that and the elastic band keeps everything together. one thing the description doesn't say that's really cool: the pages are perforated, so if you need to tear out a sheet as a list, or to give to someone, it's easy and neat. cobalt frosted goblet rated by: susan s on 8/16/2012 8:22:00 am title: unique and beautiful i really love these cobalt goblets, the blue color is super rich and it's so cool that they're made from old wine bottles. each one is a little different, so it makes for a really great set and conversation starter. the reason they got 4 stars and not 5 - the frosted surface really shows fingerprints during use! the prints wash right off, so it's not permanent. divided mango wood tray rated by: susan s on 8/16/2012 8:17:00 am title: just gorgeous! these mango wood trays are beautiful! the sections are deep enough they can be used to hold thick dips. real attention getter on your table. huntington reclaimed wood round coasters set of four rated by: britney on 8/15/2012 11:33:00 am title: perfect for the beach this coasters are so perfect for that casual beach house look. they're rustic looking but smooth enough to be stable when you set your drink on them. love the colors! they're so vibrant! acacia wood colonial bowl rated by: karl c. on 8/14/2012 8:18:00 am title: perfect salad bowl love that it matches the salad hands, looks good on the table and feel sturdy. this is big enough to hold a meal type salad. since it's fairly shallow, smaller salads don't get swallowed up either. it's the perfect salad bowl! la fortuna hummingbird feeder tall rated by: roxane jordan on 8/7/2012 7:01:00 am title: unique hummingbird feeder because the feeder is handcrafted it took a bit longer to receive but the wait was worth it. it is truly a work of art! frida glass rated by: andrea on 7/28/2012 8:35:00 am title: looks very different my glasses (and pitcher) are mostly covered with dark green color spots and lots more clear areas. the glasses look very different than the one picture here which has the vibrant yellow, orange, red and light green. the product does not have the same festive feel to it. also, customer service has been impossible to reach (no one answers the phone). very frustrtating. frida pitcher rated by: andrea on 7/28/2012 8:31:00 am title: looked very different than website picture my pitcher is mostly dark green glass spots and has lots of clear glass area...very different than the vibrant yellows, red, light green and orange shown on the website picture...it has a very different look. plus, its been impossible to get a person in the customer service department (no one answers the phone) to try to return the item. sonoma harvest dinnerware collection rated by: mrs. miller on 7/23/2012 11:04:00 am title: defintely recommend these! i love the colors, size and durability (especially around granite counter tops) and appreciate having set to purchase instead of having to mix and match myself. also, we all love the fact that dishes don't get too hot in microwave. i have some corisca that get too hot and if you heat meals for kids, you know what i mean. reclaimed redwood frame 4"x6" rated by: allison on 7/15/2012 9:55:00 am title: good but... i ordered two frames - one 4x6 and one 5x7. the smaller frame is gorgeous - exactly what you would expect based on the website. beautiful color and grain, and i love the rough hewn edges. however, the larger frame looks unfinished. it almost looks like it needs another coat of stain or a clear sealant. the finish is much lighter (even knowing that the natural wood means no two pieces are identical) and has a very dull finish as opposed to the other frame. i love the idea of these frames, and i did expect to see variations in them, but was surprised at how different they really are. overall i really do like them and would recommend them. bamboo grow pot rack rated by: bethany on 7/13/2012 5:50:00 pm title: lame pots not included. this is just a piece of medal with holes in it. why would they call it a bamboo pot rack when there are no bamboo pots? it should simply be called a "pot rack". i guess it is my fault for not reading the fine print. tahoe soy candle rated by: sam conklin on 7/9/2012 1:08:00 pm title: two thumbs up! wonderful candles with fabulous scents. the bamboo & agave and yuzu mint are my favorites!! vineyard soy candle rated by: sam conklin on 7/9/2012 1:01:00 pm title: heavenly! i recently got my hands on the mandarin & lavender scented candle and love, love, love it! bamboo dry erase magnet board rated by: christopher lund on 7/6/2012 12:23:00 pm title: great concept, needs more options. my neighbor has this and i liked it so much that i asked for the website name to buy one for me. i had naturally assumed that there would be at least two sizes, if not three, to choose from. 4x11 is just too small for my needs. imagine a piece of letter-sized paper (8.5x11), then fold it in half (lengthwise) and that is the size of this board. organic cotton car seat cover rated by: sandra huffer on 7/5/2012 4:59:00 pm title: harry barker cotton car seat cover i've been looking a long time for a pet seat cover. i love this product due to the nice fit for the back seat of an suv, it stays in place with the loops you snap to the head rests and it's easy to clean due to the cotton material which isn't a heavy weight. would highly recommend this product. it would be great if there was a smaller size also available for non-suv vehicles. good dog peanut butter & jelly dog treats rated by: leolie on 6/27/2012 2:50:00 pm title: awesome treats! my pug cooper loves these pb&j treats. every time he sees the box, he gets so happy and excited. i also love that they are made from natural ingredients. these are my dog's favorite treats. recycled railroad tie bench rated by: lisa p. on 6/18/2012 3:44:00 pm title: gorgeous and as sturdy as it looks the reclaimed railroad tie bench is so perfect in my entry way! i love the rustic, rough look. it's really easy to assemble, and really heavy. but it's also super sturdy. it's a great spot to sit and take off shoes in the entry way. pear sculpture set of 3 green rated by: lisa p. on 6/18/2012 3:41:00 pm title: perfect for a fruit basket these pears are just perfect to fill up a fruit basket on the counter. they look great and feel heavier than you'd expect and they're super glossy! i got a set of the green and a set of the white and they're so bright and fresh looking. owen carafe rated by: suzanne on 6/13/2012 3:21:00 pm title: a cool carafe this is a wine carafe that's actually cool! most carafes are either really fussy, or too restauranty looking. this one is perfect! it's super cool looking, a little chunky and is very stable, but it's surprisingly easy to pick up and pour. mango wood bowl rated by: jennie on 6/12/2012 1:03:00 pm title: great fruit bowl we like to keep fresh fruit on the counter for easy snacks. when we put apples and oranges in this mango bowl, it looks like a decorator centerpiece. the bowl is gorgeous, beautiful grain and the bark edge is really neat. it's a definite statement piece! preserve cups 16oz rated by: jennie on 6/12/2012 12:58:00 pm title: forget disposables we entertain a lot, and having so many glasses was just not practical, but we hated all the disposable plastic cups. the preserve cups seemed like a great alternative. they're attractive and far sturdier than the disposable kind, and they really can just be tossed in the dishwasher. and we feel better that we're not throwing away mountains of plastic cups each time we have a party! brittany linen tea towel in copper rated by: fran stowe on 6/12/2012 12:49:00 pm title: kitchen must have! i got this towel as a gift and it has become a kitchen favorite! at first it was very stiff and was wrinkled after washing but i liked the colors. after the second washing, the towel transformed! it came out super soft and only barely wrinkled. it's perfect for drying delicate glasses, and looks good enough to bring to the table. i like this one so much, i went back and ordered more for myself! soji solar lanterns rated by: rk on 6/12/2012 12:44:00 pm title: so colorful! the colors are so rich and bold, and these solar lanterns are the perfect size for hanging on a deck overhang or in a tree. the fabric is surprisingly soft feeling but still very durable and they are super-easy to assemble. they do need to charge before use and the glow is soft, subtle and very pretty. fat cat placemat rated by: julie on 6/8/2012 1:43:00 pm title: a little fat cat love this placemat is a great addition to my kitchen floor! and my fat cat loves it as well! austen cheese serving set rated by: angela daniels on 6/8/2012 12:41:00 pm title: sleek and chic! i got these to go with the slate cheese board. i like metal and stone instead of wood so these were just perfect. they look really good and feel great to use. i like the weight of them and the sleek style. slate serving board rated by: angela daniels on 6/8/2012 12:39:00 pm title: tres chic! i love these natural slate cheese boards! i prefer the look and feel of stone over wood. i like that i can write on the board with chalk and label the cheeses. these are thicker and heavier than they look online, they're very sturdy. soji floral bloom solar lantern rated by: cecelia b. on 6/6/2012 9:32:00 am title: pretty, pretty, pretty! these are sooo pretty! my balcony is decorated in shades of pink and flowers, so these were really a perfect accent. i hung three of them to give off a nice glow. the only reason it's not 5 stars is the light is a little blue, and i would prefer a warmer color. but that's just the fact of an led. i love the way these solar lanterns look day and night! carnival margarita set rated by: ree h. on 6/1/2012 8:34:00 am title: perfect margarita set these are so colorful and pretty and they're really sturdy feeling. i love that they're made from recycled glass and each glass is just a little bit different. flower cork board rated by: jessie s on 5/15/2012 2:17:00 pm title: kids room decor my daughters loved these when they saw them, so we got several to decorate a wall in their room. now they have a wall full of pretty flower cork boards. hamptons juicer rated by: sarah on 5/15/2012 1:57:00 pm title: must-have classic the hamptons juicer is just so cute! and it's practical, too. i originally bought it to decorate my retro kitchen, but grabbed it one day to make lemonade for the kids. it was perfect and so easy to use and clean up. these would make a great wedding gift too! mountain collection contemporary natural rated by: rk on 5/10/2012 2:38:00 pm title: simply gorgeous! i bought the 7x10 mountain collection bamboo rug to define a space in a large living/dining room. i liked the soft, natural color and smooth finish on the bamboo. it's the perfect accent for the room. it does not slip, slide or move anywhere, even on hardwood floors with teenage boys moving around and it's incredibly durable - handling boys, chairs, high heels and all the usual traffic in our living room. it's surprisingly cushiony to stand on. i expected it to feel "harder" but it's comfy enough to sit on for movie watching. absolute worth the purchase! equal linen tea towel rated by: rk on 5/7/2012 12:38:00 pm title: do i frame it or use it? when you upon the package and unfold the equal linen tea towel, it feels just a bit stiff, but it looks gorgeous! just one washing and the towel turns into a fabulous, crisp but soft thing that looks amazing in the kitchen. i can't decide if i want to frame it as wall art, or use it as a towel. either way, the oatmeal linen, slightly rough texture and muted coppery-orange print make this towel look terrific! classic double old-fashion glass rated by: steven b on 5/7/2012 12:34:00 pm title: old school cool the classic double old fashion glasses are just total retro cool. they look and feel just like a classic low-ball should, they feel really weighty, solid. recycled glass ups the cool factor even more. reclaimed wood tray rated by: lara b on 5/3/2012 3:04:00 pm title: rustic and gorgeous the reclaimed wood tray is just the right size for serving coffee or tea. it's sturdier than i expected it would be. the tray looks like it's been around for years and years. truly one of a kind and gorgeous. recycled wine bottle oversized wall clock rated by: sabrina w. on 5/3/2012 2:46:00 pm title: big clock! first off - the recycled wine bottle clock is big! i wanted a large clock for our eat-in kitchen which is done in stainless steel and cobalt blue. the clock is much lighter than you'd think because it's aluminum. the colors are really vibrant. the hole to hang it on is a little hard to find because it's hidden behind the top bottle, but that's a good thing for looks. very sleek and modern looking - our friends all love it, so do our kids. natural bamboo shower caddy rated by: jackie on 5/3/2012 11:15:00 am title: glad i chose this! this shower caddy looks great in our bathroom, the bamboo matches our color scheme perfectly. it also has a surprising amount of space. gets things up off the side of the tub. :) teak bath stool rated by: dawn r. on 4/30/2012 1:59:00 pm title: sturdy and gorgeous! we just moved and needed a stool for our new bathroom. i wanted wood to warm up an otherwise too cool room and this looked perfect. i loved that this teak bath stool was made with reclaimed wood. it looks great holding towels outside the shower and it's super sturdy! capiz eco tree plates set of 4 rated by: dawn r. on 4/30/2012 1:55:00 pm title: so pretty! these are so much prettier in person! the plates are super lightweight, and very shiny. i love the pattern on these. i bought them as serving spoon rests, and they're perfect. portland 3 taster beer flight clear rated by: john m on 4/24/2012 9:31:00 am title: cool gift! what a cool way to serve a variety of beers. we got these as gifts for our wedding party and had a tasting party for everyone. the reclaimed wine barrel slat makes a neat looking base and the glasses are perfect for a short pour with just the right amount of foam. bee planter large rated by: gene kendall on 3/29/2012 10:27:00 pm title: essential part of a vision i searched online and in local brick and morter stores for just the container for a premium amaryllis bulb i wanted to present to a special friend. this pot won my informal contest. it was all i wished and has been very well received. i'm a very happy customer and have a very happy friend/recipient. thanks bambeco. capiz eco coral plates set of 4 rated by: beth a. on 3/29/2012 5:23:00 pm title: simply divine dessert plates i was overwhelmed when i opened these beautiful little plates. they look so expensive, i almost thought there must have been a mistake on the listing price. they look as though they're made from glass and therefor fragile, but when i accidentally dropped one (not a far distance) i was overjoyed to see that the lacquered shell did not break!i don't think i have the heart to eat off these so i put a sticky hook on the back and plan to hang them on the wall. will have to order more for guests! pike messenger bag rated by: shelly w on 3/29/2012 2:20:00 pm title: awesome bag! the pike messenger bag is even cooler in person! it's well-made and heavier than i expected. the seams are smooth and neat and the interior pockets are well designed. it's just right for a laptop and more than a few basics. it's very roomy and looks awesome! elliot dop kit rated by: janet on 3/26/2012 2:27:00 pm title: love it i needed a new make-up case so i decided to try out this dop kit... it is really well made and very unique - mine is made out of tires with a cool pattern of triangles on it! without the pattern it would look very masculine... but mine is very cool. charleston reclaimed wood pastel birdhouse rated by: barbara c. on 3/23/2012 2:53:00 pm title: sooo adorable! i ordered this thinking it was purely decorative but just too cute to pass up. i was thrilled to find it's actually a working birdhouse with an entrance about 1 3/4 inches. what a great find for my front porch! the only reason it's not 5 stars is the small hatch for cleaning. vertical waves welcome mat rated by: cynthia wallace on 3/23/2012 11:15:00 am title: love this mat!! this mat is so colorful and looks great at my front door! constructed very well and holds up to lots of traffic. handmade dogs welcome sign rated by: shana black on 2/24/2012 1:04:00 pm title: you said it! dog people are my kind of people, and that's why i love you guys! no better way to say it than this rustic dog-lovin sign! i put mine outdoors and it has yet to look any different. reclaimed natural wood frame 8"x10" rated by: danna on 2/17/2012 1:10:00 pm title: awesome frames these are much more beautiful than they look in the picture. they are in a similar price range as frames i was looking at from crate and barrel and pottery barn. they are much more beautiful though and it's a bonus that they are made from reclaimed wood! i am going to buy more. no place like home recycled metal sign rated by: mary p. on 2/16/2012 10:33:00 am title: a warm welcoming i have an enclosed entryway so i put this sign on the door to brighten it up in the cold winter. so it will be exposed to the cold air but not elements. hoping that's ok. very cute and rustic looking. matches my "eclectic" and rustic chic decor. bambeco bay leaf heart wreath rated by: hamish p. on 2/15/2012 10:37:00 am title: where the heart is darling! a multi purpose gift. i don't think the leaves are treated or coated with anything which means you can use them in recipes. such a cute idea. jersey sheet set rated by: jamie h. on 2/15/2012 10:15:00 am title: butterysoft i love these sheets. i got them for the winter because i wanted something soft and cozy warm. however, the weather has been so warm and i was so shocked at how cool these sheets could be at night. it doesn't trap heat but provides the perfect amount of comfort. natural teak frame 5"x7" rated by: hartely m. on 2/15/2012 10:08:00 am title: teak montage these frames are special enough to be decor on their own. i got a couple of different shapes and sizes of these, in two tones and framed leaves, shrub clipping, etc and put them together in a frame collage. i will have to upload a photo! big wheel tumblers set of 4 rated by: tracey h. on 2/13/2012 11:38:00 am title: retro flare these glasses are sweet and give a little retro flavor to my random assortment of dinnerware and glassware. great for kids because they're small and make it easy to control how much juice my kids drink at one time. built in portion control. stella solar lanterns rated by: hallie routh on 2/13/2012 11:35:00 am title: solar touch such a festive touch! i saw similar hanging lanterns in cabo last summer and wanted to bring the same touch of tropical style to my suburban patio. voila! these are perfect. no difficult wires to hook up or plug in. just make sure to charge up correctly. beautiful. stainless steel compost bin rated by: sheila m. on 2/13/2012 11:32:00 am title: trash chic finally a chic way to compost! nobody has any idea what this cute little container holds inside, and i have it sitting right in my kitchen. thank you for creating a way to compost without turning your kitchen into a garbage dump. capiz eco coral plates set of 4 rated by: faye h. on 1/5/2012 3:53:00 pm title: #1 xmas gift goes to... love these beautiful plates and can't wait to hang them in my shore house. any tips on how to hang them? don't want to drill anything in them, and their very light so i may use a sticky adhesive. melaboo measuring cups rated by: paulina on 1/5/2012 2:32:00 pm title: these measure up love these measuring cups. they are beautiful and substantial! you gotta love your tools if you're going to love to cook ;) pacifica pint glass rated by: hope induiz on 1/5/2012 2:28:00 pm title: summer fun beautiful glassware that's sturdy enough to put in the dishwasher?! perfection. note: they aren't identical matches because they are authentically hand made. pacifica pint glasses set of 4 rated by: hope induiz on 1/5/2012 2:28:00 pm title: summer fun beautiful glassware that's sturdy enough to put in the dishwasher?! perfection. note: they aren't identical matches because they are authentically hand made. eco picnic basket for four rated by: paris mcmellum on 12/30/2011 11:36:00 am title: fresh air picnic i got this for a giveaway at a local charity auction - it really is a perfect gift for the family and encourages people to get out in nature and enjoy the fresh air!!! sinatra martini glass rated by: trish p. on 12/29/2011 11:20:00 am title: cheers this is not a drink for the weak-handed. this glassware is very thich and durable - not of the delicate type. very swanky if you like a litte flavor with your cocktails! cookie monster treat jar rated by: carey millison on 12/29/2011 11:16:00 am title: picture perfect this photo can not do this adorable cookie jar justice. it is such a nice gift for anyone with kids of a sweet tooth ;) recycled railroad tie bench rated by: sasha b. on 12/29/2011 11:13:00 am title: thanks! this is my favorite piece of furniture in my house!!! bambeco bay leaf with chilis swag rated by: harmony p. on 12/29/2011 11:11:00 am title: christmas lives on i have this still up and it's still a nice touch even though its a tad bit crispy! sonoma red dinnerware collection rated by: tamryn h. on 12/29/2011 9:10:00 am title: red for all seasons i wanted to change the look of my kitchen decor, because i was sick of the blank, white that shows through my glass cabinets. this bold, deep red is exactly what i was looking for! it's breathes some life into my kitchen and adds some livliness. the ceramic is very thick and sturdy. reindeer basket rated by: harriet m. on 12/21/2011 3:42:00 pm title: hand crafted gem please note this basket is a lot smaller than the picture shows. this many regular sized pine cones would not fit in it. this would be perfect for a little potted plant which i brought over as a housewarming gift for a dinner party. very sweet! frog king bottle opener rated by: rob on 12/11/2011 9:49:00 pm title: the king! i picked one up many years ago in a small shop in chicago. had always wished i had gotten more than one, and on a whim looked for another recently which brought me to babeco. ordering a few up for gifts too! bamboo crumb board rated by: dee on 12/9/2011 1:12:00 pm title: great product! i have had one of these for a long (10+ yrs)time. i have needed a replacement for about 3-4 years, but i couldn't find them anywhere. i am so excited to find then again. bambeco bay leaf with chilis swag rated by: jenn wu on 12/9/2011 11:19:00 am title: great wreath alternative i was looking for something aside from a wreath to put on my front door, but wanted to make sure it is equally as festive. i was worried this wouldn't make as much of a statement but it is perfect! the chilis are a great touch - so unique and fits in with my southwestern style house. tiburon organic apron, dishtowel, mitt in charcoal rated by: trisha mckenna on 12/9/2011 11:15:00 am title: husband- approved i love this because it encourages my husband to get dirty in the kitchen. he likes the fact that this eco-friendly version isn't covered in flowers or cartoon puppies like my other ones. so when we're preparing a big meal, he grabs this apron, and jumps right in to help!
