local recycling or compost many communities offer curbside pickup of trees to be turned into compost, mulch or other garden goodness. check with your local municipality. fire starters if you’ve got a fireplace or firepit, your tree represents terrific firestarters. the small branches and needles make great kindling. cut larger pieces into manageable sizes and let dry thoroughly. just be aware that a sappy pine can add to creosote buildup. the bonfire of the christmas trees many communities host a bonfire to combine disposing of the trees with a community social event. if yours doesn’t, check into local campgrounds and beaches for those that allow a bonfire. mulch dried out needles make great mulch. rent or borrow a woodchipper for the rest of the tree, and you’ve got a season’s worth of terrific mulch for your garden. path edgers or trim mulch or compost the smaller pieces, then cut the trunk into rounds and use to edge a patch, or outline a garden area. larger branches can be used to create rustic edging for planting beds. stake it use the larger branches to create stakes for your plants, and position the trunk (with a few branches still on it) so a vining plant can climb all over it. with a little creativity, you can create a rustic trellis. submerge as a fish habitat if you’ve got a pond handy, a submerged tree makes a great habitat for fish. it will slowly decompose over the course of the year, just another part of the circle of life. bird buffet trim off the needles and small branches (mulch), then drill holes in the trunk and fill them with suet, seed, etc. hang treats in the remaining branches and you’ve just created a perfect bird sanctuary and buffet. happy bird watching! dune restoration some communities are using old trees as a way to help rebuild and restore sand dunes. check with your local municipality to find out what services are available in your area. get social: posted in lifestyle | tagged christmas, christmas tree, compost, mulch | 1 reply post navigation ← older posts subscribe by email email address stay tuned for perfect pairings… a stylish, sustainable party plan subscribe by rss. archives select month january 2014  (1) december 2013  (23) november 2013  (24) october 2013  (24) september 2013  (21) august 2013  (23) july 2013  (23) june 2013  (22) may 2013  (23) april 2013  (23) march 2013  (22) february 2013  (20) january 2013  (23) december 2012  (24) november 2012  (24) october 2012  (23) september 2012  (20) august 2012  (25) july 2012  (23) june 2012  (23) may 2012  (24) april 2012  (13) sips of green a few eco facts… just for fun eco faqs the cost of beef… meatless monday sip of green your other foot… calculating your nitrogen footprint how big is your footprint?
