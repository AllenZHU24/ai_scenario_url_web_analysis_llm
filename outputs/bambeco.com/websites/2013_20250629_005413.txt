born of life-changing inspiration, bambeco is passionate about products with purpose. co-founded by susan aplin and carolyn wapnick, bambeco is the premier retailer for sustainable home furnishings and décor, delivering a collection of exquisite, high quality products and artisan creations—all reclaimed, repurposed, renewable, recycled, natural or organic. made with the highest respect for the earth and its people. simplifying this message we like to say bambeco delivers sustainability with style. for us, sustainability isn't just a concept but a conversation- it's a personal perspective and an opportunity to give voice to what matters. it’s a charge and a mission to reduce a carbon footprint while enlarging our personal imprint—an imprint that leaves an impression, influences others now, and leaves a legacy for a lifetime. at bambeco changing the world isn't about being radical but real. reclaimed, repurposed, redeemed, recycled. our products. our people. our partners. our customers. authentic and interesting to the core. what sustains you?
