the artisan dips and turns their blowpipe until they have a blob of molten glass on the end. now here’s the challenge. at that temperature, the glass is essentially liquid! it takes skill and constant motion to keep the glass on the pipe. the next step is to smooth the surface of the glass blob; that’s done on a marver table. next the real magic begins. the artisan blows through the pipe to form a small air bubble in the molten glass. they have to be careful not to blow too hard, or too much. it’s a delicate process and the goal is to create a thin layer of glass. this is also the point where different colors can be added. temperature control is extremely important and the artisan will reheat the glass as needed to maintain the ideal temperature for blowing. they’ll continue to shape the glass, adding more and more layers in a delicate balancing act. if the glass gets too cold, it cracks; if it’s too hot, it won’t blow out evenly. the next step is to smooth the sides of the piece on wooden blocks soaked in water, followed by more blowing to finish the shape. there are two main forms of glass blowing. free blowing came first and the artisan uses quick puffs of air to shape the glass by hand. in mold blowing, the artisan inflates the glass using a mold to shape each piece. once the shaping is complete, the glass is removed from the blow pipe and placed in an extremely hot kiln to slowly cool. if it cools too rapidly, it will crack. the cooled glass is taken out, inspected and given a light polish and then it’s done! glass blowing is a challenging art in and of itself, but when working with recycled materials that may not all have the same melting points, it becomes an even greater challenge. skilled artisans will use the differences in recycled glass to their advantage, using them to create different colors, textures and patterns in the finished product. hand-blown glass isn’t perfect. though they won’t be found in every piece, it’s not uncommon to find tiny traces of non-glass material in artisan blown glass, especially if it’s made from recycled materials. it might also be bits of sand, or other materials picked up from the furnace or the mold. small bubbles and minor surface imperfections are also not uncommon and don’t negatively impact the structure or beauty of the glass. shop glassware ceramics wood soft goods habitats our story about us sustainable living blog © 2018 bambeco lifestyle international, llc. trademark all rights reserved. private policy
