i've used moleskine notebooks for years and i'm thrilled to find a green alternative! this notebook holds up and has a smooth, elegant cover and pages. perforated pages are a bonus, and i love the colors, too! i'll be buying many of these. recycled railroad tie bench rated by: eco_nico on 10/5/2010 11:09:00 am title: love this bench! this bench is amazing - i love the dark finish on the wood and the story you can see in each piece. the wood is aged with scratches, holes, and natural wear and tear. it even smells good! to put it together you just have to screw in 4 bolts to attach the legs. great for sitting or as an entryway piece. aurora glow string lights rated by: solarindc on 9/22/2010 7:06:00 am title: lovely on the porch! we have a couple of strands of these along the rails of our back deck. there is no outside electric socket so the solar is perfect, and the light sensor turns them off at dusk and off at dawn! they seem to hold a charge really well, even after a couple of cloudy days. definitely recommend! solar hand-blown glass votives rated by: noel on 9/16/2010 4:11:00 pm title: my favorite night light! i purchased the garnet solar votive, and i am so amazed! it adds so much to my porch and i love how i don't even need to turn it off and on! it was larger than i was expecting and really so beautiful when it's glowing at night, but also during the day when you can see the unique hand blown glass detail. bamboo undercut design cutting boards rated by: kelley on 9/16/2010 9:57:00 am title: a fixture on my countertop i've gone through a ton of cutting boards and now i have found one that is here to stay! the bamboo has a rich color that doesn't come through on the picture but it looks beautiful on my counter. plus it is easy to wash with just a rinse of soap and water and food doesn't stick to it like it did on my plastic one. bamboo is the way to go! organic spa bar rated by: melissa alyson on 9/13/2010 6:23:00 pm title: spa soaps my sister got me these soaps as a gift and i feel like i'm in a spa or on vacation whenever i use them. heavenly, especially the grapefruit scent! flower welcome mat rated by: joy on 9/13/2010 6:19:00 pm title: pretty and seasonal lovin' this doormat for the fall. it lays nicely and looks pretty against my reddish door. it's wearing really well, too. penguin & rooster recycled pete messenger bag olive rated by: kimberly conley on 9/13/2010 6:13:00 pm title: sporty messenger bag funky bag that i can use for both traveling, work and the gym. it holds a ton of stuff, and everyone is amazed that it's made of recycled plastic bottles. totally unique and perfect conversation piece dog collar - oslo rated by: carolyn herrmann on 9/13/2010 6:07:00 pm title: cute leash love this leash! got it for our puppy, abby, and have received many compliments. pink and brown colors are awesome orbee dog ball rated by: renee on 9/13/2010 3:36:00 pm title: my dog's new obsession! my dog is so in love with this thing! i have never seen him so fixated on something that didn't have a treat stuffed inside. there's actually a space for you to put food or something in it, but he didn't even need it! organic spa bar rated by: meghan on 9/13/2010 10:56:00 am title: this grapfruit soap is great! i bought the grapefruit soap with oatmeal in it. i love it because the grapefruit smell is not overpowering at all, it's very subtle and the oatmeal is very gentle but also exfoliates your skin! lavender hand & body lotion rated by: howard felsenfeld on 9/10/2010 4:05:00 pm title: great gift i bought this body lotion for my wife and she really thinks it's great. thank you! a perfect anniversary gift. bamboo white bath towels rated by: howard felsenfeld on 9/10/2010 4:03:00 pm title: the perfect gift i recently bought a couple of these towels as a gift for my wife. they are very nice after a shower and she loves them. they'd make a great birthday or holiday gift. buddha bowls rated by: lucy felsenfeld on 9/8/2010 8:55:00 pm title: versatile bowls i recently bought two of these bowls... a green and a blue. they are so adorable and will be perfect for a ton of different treats! ice cream, cereal, meatballs, soup, fruit... i'm planning on making little, individual dishes with guacamole and chips for this weekend's football game! i'd like to buy all of the colors to make a complete set! lavender bath salts rated by: marley schwartz on 8/30/2010 2:56:00 pm title: heavenly salts these lavender baths salts are wonderful. i treat myself to a soak in the tub once a week, and my stress melts away. they smell beautiful and the bottle looks pretty sitting on the ledge. bamboo eucalyptus bath towels rated by: gail weichman on 8/12/2010 7:11:00 pm title: lovely towel set the bamboo eucalyptus bath towels are so soft! i've never felt bamboo towels before, but they are really lovely. i highly recommend them! lavender bamboo grow pot rated by: sherry on 8/12/2010 8:53:00 am title: lovely lavendar plant! i adore this little lavender plant! i don't really have a green thumb, but loved the bamboo pot, so i figured i'd give it a try... the directions were simple and it's actually growing! i put next to the candles & bubble bath in my bathroom and water it each week. i plan on buying similar plants from bambeco and have my own indoor garden! planet green bag rated by: carol kramme on 7/19/2010 10:31:00 am title: cute and practical! very cute, strong bag that folds up to nothing and fits in my handbag. i can stop for groceries or anything and feel stylish using this rather vs. plastic. carnival hummingbird feeder round rated by: rachael on 7/13/2010 2:51:00 pm title: love this addition to my backyard! this hummingbird feeder is a wonderful addition to my backyard. i love watching the birds it attracts, and i especially love that it's made of recycled glass. so glad i found it! bamboo coaster set of four rated by: hilary on 7/9/2010 1:47:00 pm title: great quality product it was exactly what i was expecting. the style is so simple but the concave top adds a flare and serves a purpose. it arrived in exactly a day! couldn't be happier with my purchase. soleil serving trays rated by: gigi on 6/29/2010 2:56:00 pm title: i love my yellow tray! i have been looking for large bright yellow tray for a long time. i ordered the large soleil tray a week ago and i love it! it is bright yet the color complements perfectly my decor, it is large enough that i am using it on top of my ottomman as a coffee table and the finish adds just the right amount of texture. i may get the small ones later... we'll see! soji modern solar lanterns rated by: leslie horton on 6/22/2010 11:37:00 am title: do not buy despite looking good, these lanterns are worthless as a "lantern". they charge very poorly and do not hold a charge despite 6 hours of direct sunlight. i am very unhappy with this purchase. soji solar lanterns rated by: kbw on 6/21/2010 6:27:00 pm title: love our globes of color! we have about twenty of these in varying colors strung in the trees of our backyard. we love them during the daytime when the pretty colors of the lanterns is so cheery, and we love them during the evening when the lights come on and they offer subtle yet present light. my only beef with them is the color (of the lantern fabric) fades, and fades significantly, pretty quickly. i think that's dumb for lanterns which are meant to live outside .... but guess what? when they fade completely i'll purchase more because i love them. and i'll get them here at bambeco because the price is the best here and bambeco's customer service has proven superb.123 wool coaster set rated by: sandra on 5/20/2010 3:38:00 pm title: great product - highly recommend given to us as gift - best coasters we have ever owned-no scratching furniture and super absorbent if there is a spill. highly recommend. heirloom tomato garden kit rated by: karen beauregard on 5/5/2010 2:08:00 pm title: great seeds i bought this little tin of seeds several years ago, but just this year got around to planting them. i was amazed at the 95% germination rate - great seeds!!! artisan root vases rated by: sandra on 1/14/2010 10:22:00 am title: root vase this is the most beautiful vase i have ever come across. i already have two of the root bowls and love any of the root products for the originality, beauty and versatility. all of my friends are asking: "where did you find those?" keep adding root products and i will keep buying. the style would certainly fit in any design setting. i highly recommend and oh my for the price how great. mountain collection cobblestone rated by: sheila on 12/21/2009 10:11:00 am title: really nice bamboo rug! this is beautiful. very well made, nice backing and lovely variations in color. it's a little dark for my poorly lit office so i'm exchanging it for the chocolate version but it would be gorgeous in a sun filled room! organic cotton napkin set of 4 rated by: sheila on 12/21/2009 10:04:00 am title: love these! i got these in the rose color and love them. they are a beautiful color, have held up very well after several washings and have a lovely feel. i'm coming back to order more! candy stick ornaments rated by: janice on 11/25/2009 3:39:00 pm title: awesome holiday tree i added the candy sticks to my tree this year to incorporate more eco friendly ornaments and everyone loves them! leaf ceramic dinnerware collection rated by: carole volsten on 11/25/2009 3:34:00 pm title: dinner conversation piece the leaf plates have added a new topic of discussion to our dinner table. my husband just remarked that since we've added the plates to our dinner collection, the dinner conversation with our friends always includes fifteen minutes about the quality of the leaf prints, the importance of eating off of a plate that is healthy for us and more. leaf ceramic dinnerware collection rated by: casey rimer on 11/25/2009 3:30:00 pm title: love my new dinnerware! i love my new leaf dinnerware! the shape and design of the plates creates an artistic statement on my table. i wash them in the dishwasher and they have been durable and kept their color. it's fun to serve food on this pattern. recycled plastic wave rug rated by: kspitler on 10/22/2009 3:18:00 pm title: i love it! pros - great size for the price. the colors are wonderful and the look works well with contemporary space. really appreciate recycled material. cons - none, really, just hoping it wears well as i plan to enjoy it for a long time. soji modern solar lanterns rated by: david freese on 8/26/2009 3:17:00 pm title: david freese i hung 5 of the lights in a mimosa tree, high up enough that they get enough sun even though amidst branches, to give off several hours of a golden/ivory glow after sunset. many neighbors have commented on how great they look. i like that there are no cords or central solar units to have to deal with -- each is entirely self-contained! recycled plastic sunburst rug rated by: marita ventura on 8/21/2009 1:43:00 pm title: love this in my garage entry to the mudroom i have this lovely, colorful mat in my garage at the entry to my mudroom. it scoops up and collects all the dirt and dust from our shoes and paws before we enter our home. just perfect! aurora glow string lights rated by: ginger on 8/20/2009 3:33:00 pm title: my favorite summer purchase! these are the best outdoor lights i have ever bought. they work like a charm and they are beautiful. business bags rated by: jeff m. on 5/1/2009 9:55:00 pm title: saving landfill space one walk at a time i'm thrilled to have discovered an alternative to regular plastic bags for picking up after my dog. we use these at least twice a day (always carry an extra bag, though). i had been using plastic bags my newspapers came in but always felt a little guilty even though they were getting a "second use." business bags are definitely a better, guilt-free way to go. i highly recommend! root bowl rated by: sandra on 4/23/2009 12:28:00 pm title: superior root bowl this bowl is even more beautiful than described. the quality and workmanship are tops. the service of bambeco and the friendliness of the staff can't be beat. affiliates about us careers privacy site index contact us customer feedback signup for email updates product tag cloud industry links in the press | most recently searched our blogs shop by brand shop by category frequently asked questions | friends of bambeco testimonials product index product review index product video index alphabetical index shop by part number search by classification copyright 2010 bambeco all rights reserved. powered by shop visible™ ecommerce solution
