space an ounce of down will take up. the higher the fill power, the larger the down cluster. meaning, less down is required to fill the same amount of space. comforters with higher fill powers are fluffier, more breathable, provide better insulation and last longer luxury 600 fill power white goose down envelop yourself in the luxury of premium down. made with the most resilient and highest quality 600 fill white goose down for a soft, luxurious and cozy sleep. supreme 700 fill power polish goose down one of the finest down clusters on the market, polish white goose down delivers superior loft and supreme comfort. ultimate 800 fill power siberian goose down our highest grade down, for your best rest ever. siberian goose down is renowned for its premium loft, unparalleled durability and cloud-like comfort. 2. choose a weight while down fill power determines breathability and quality, weight determines the warmth level of your comforter. heavier comforters are simply filled with more down and provide more overall warmth. choose a down weight based on personal comfort, season or room temperature. summer weight lightweight warmth – ideal for warmer sleepers, warm climates and rooms above 70of. year round weight medium weight warmth - ideal for all seasons and rooms between 60of and 65of 3. choose a size twin 68"w x 86"l queen 86"w x 86"l king 104"w x 86"l if you have any additional questions, please let us know, by calling our customer service department at 1.866.535.4144 or visit our customer service page. × vintage kantha each vintage kantha is a handcrafted masterpiece made from recycled vintage cotton saris. hand-sewn and embroidered by artisans in india, each provides a livelihood for women in poor communities and gives their children the opportunity to live better, more productive lives. kantha is the ancient indian art of embroidery, and the actual “kantha” is a simple running or pick stitch. the background of the cloth is embroidered with thousands of small and delicate kantha stitches to create a beautiful reversible one of a kind. while making these meticulously crafted kanthas, the cloth is given layers that are kept together by the stitches. due to the handcrafted nature of these pieces, there may be small patches and quilts may not align perfectly when folded. these are traits inherent in hand-made pieces and are the mark of human hands and artisan expression. × carbon neutral by 2020 we believe it is our shared responsibility to help defend against the impacts of climate change. that’s why we’ve

tree. according to oxford university research, planting and growing trees is the best way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reverse global warming. bambeco is proud to partner with american forests, the oldest national nonprofit conservation organization in the country, for a joint commitment to restore and protect forests and minimize climate change. with every bambeco purchase, american forests will plant a tree. that means every earth friendly purchase adds another tree to our landscape and another step towards counteracting climate change. since we launched our "every purchase plants a tree" initiative, we've planted over 30,000 trees—enough trees to supply oxygen for 40,000 people, save and clean 2.4 billion gallons of water and absorb 480 tons of carbon dioxide per year! together, we'll grow forests.
