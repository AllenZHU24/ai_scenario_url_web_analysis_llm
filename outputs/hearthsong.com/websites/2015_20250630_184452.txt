e-mail or call us at1-800-533-4397. our story since its beginning in 1983, hearthsong has been committed to helping parents follow their instincts to provide their children with age-appropriate, wholesome, quality playthings. that's because at hearthsong, we believe childhood is a vital chapter in life-a special time when children can be occupied with the joy of being children. and, equally importantly, a time when children need to experience as much creative, imaginative play as possible because kids experience so many of life's first lessons through play. the first hearthsong catalog was printed in black and white, with pencil drawings of carefully selected toys and books and mailed from the home of founder barbara kane by her family. the name hearthsong was chosen to reflect core family values - the hearth, a traditional symbol for the center of the home, and song, a symbol of family spirit and of a special playfulness that parents and children enjoy together. over the next 30 years, hearthsong evolved into a nationally known and respected source for quality children's toys, games and crafts. parents who found unique toys for their children decades ago tell us they're now thrilled to be finding the same kinds of educational, entertaining toys to give to their children's children. our selection of products has grown and expanded too. but we can still guarantee that each item is carefully selected for its quality, safety, and relevance to your child's development - and we are steadfast in our commitment to provide you with toys you'll feel good about giving®. call 1-800-533-4397 to speak with a friendly advisor sign up for emails and special offers thank you for signing up! shop hearthsong new for holiday wooden toys kids gardening dolls & dollhouses boys gifts girls gifts sale award winners new for holiday outdoor play toys weekly best sellers view best videos hearthsong exclusives made in usa top rated my account my account my wishlist my basket site map catalogs catalog quickorder request a catalog gifts gift registry gift cards gift center help customer service returns & exchanges shipping & delivery about us our story employment privacy & security terms of use connect with us: hearthsong recommends holiday shopfireplace tool setshearth rugsnew for holidayquilts & quilt sets new for holidayholiday shopwreathsgarden statuesgarden angels everything fairieschristmas shopnew for holidaywooden toystop rated arts & crafts gifts for himholiday essentialsgifts for kidspractical giftsnew for holiday bento boxesreusable gift wrapsgift centerreusable bagssilicone wine glasses copyright © 2015 hearthsong
