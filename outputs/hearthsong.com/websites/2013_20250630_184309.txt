e-mail or call us at1-800-533-4397. our story since its beginning in 1983, hearthsong has been committed to helping parents follow their instincts to provide their children with age-appropriate, wholesome, quality playthings. that's because at hearthsong, we believe childhood is a vital chapter in life-a special time when children can be occupied with the joy of being children. and, equally importantly, a time when children need to experience as much creative, imaginative play as possible because kids experience so many of life's first lessons through play. the first hearthsong catalog was printed in black and white, with pencil drawings of carefully selected toys and books and mailed from the home of founder barbara kane by her family. the name hearthsong was chosen to reflect core family values - the hearth, a traditional symbol for the center of the home, and song, a symbol of family spirit and of a special playfulness that parents and children enjoy together. over the next 30 years, hearthsong evolved into a nationally known and respected source for quality children's toys, games and crafts. parents who found unique toys for their children decades ago tell us they're now thrilled to be finding the same kinds of educational, entertaining toys to give to their children's children. our selection of products has grown and expanded too. but we can still guarantee that each item is carefully selected for its quality, safety, and relevance to your child's development - and we are steadfast in our commitment to provide you with toys you'll feel good about giving®. call 1-800-533-4397 to speak with a friendly advisor email live chat please fill out the form to chat with a representative. *name: *email: phone: connect with us: sign up for emails and special offersthank you for signing up! shop classic toys outdoor play toys educational toys gift ideas for girls gift ideas for boys dolls & dollhouses family gifts gift finder saleshop award winners see what's new for holiday fun gifts under $25 see top pinned weekly best sellers view all videos hearthsong exclusives made in usa top ratedmy account my account my wishlist my basket order tracking site mapcatalogs shop our online catalog catalog quickorder request a cataloggifts gift registry gift cards gift center help customer service returns & exchanges shipping & deliveryabout us our story employment privacy & security terms of usehearthsong recommends window candles outdoor furniture covers firewood racks & firewood storage kitchen furniture fireside cooking log rack & log carriers gifts for her gifts for him wind spinners solar lighting outdoor lighting kids toys waldorf dolls kathe kruse dolls gifts for the family toddler toys closet organizers solar lighting kitchen gadgets kitchen organization home gadgets stocking stuffers eco friendly baby products gift wrapping ideas stainless steel straws reusable gift wrapcopyright © 2013 hearthsong
