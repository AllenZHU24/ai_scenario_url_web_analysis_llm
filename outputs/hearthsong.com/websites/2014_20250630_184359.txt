e-mail or call us at1-800-533-4397. our story since its beginning in 1983, hearthsong has been committed to helping parents follow their instincts to provide their children with age-appropriate, wholesome, quality playthings. that's because at hearthsong, we believe childhood is a vital chapter in life-a special time when children can be occupied with the joy of being children. and, equally importantly, a time when children need to experience as much creative, imaginative play as possible because kids experience so many of life's first lessons through play. the first hearthsong catalog was printed in black and white, with pencil drawings of carefully selected toys and books and mailed from the home of founder barbara kane by her family. the name hearthsong was chosen to reflect core family values - the hearth, a traditional symbol for the center of the home, and song, a symbol of family spirit and of a special playfulness that parents and children enjoy together. over the next 30 years, hearthsong evolved into a nationally known and respected source for quality children's toys, games and crafts. parents who found unique toys for their children decades ago tell us they're now thrilled to be finding the same kinds of educational, entertaining toys to give to their children's children. our selection of products has grown and expanded too. but we can still guarantee that each item is carefully selected for its quality, safety, and relevance to your child's development - and we are steadfast in our commitment to provide you with toys you'll feel good about giving®. x no purchase necessary! just enter your email address, now through december 31, 2014. view details> call 1-800-533-4397 to speak with a friendly advisor email live chat please fill out the form to chat with a representative. *name: *email: phone: connect with us: sign up for emails and special offersthank you for signing up! shopclassic toysoutdoor play toyseducational toysgift ideas for girlsgift ideas for boysdolls & dollhousesfamily giftsgift findersaleshopnew for holidayholiday joy under $25award winnersfun with sciencetop christmas toys for 2014weekly best sellersview all videoshearthsong exclusivesmade in usatop ratedmy accountmy accountmy wishlistmy basketorder trackingsite mapcatalogsshop our online catalogcatalog quickorderrequest a cataloggiftsgift registrygift cardsgift centerhelpcustomer servicereturns & exchangesshipping & deliveryabout usour storyemploymentprivacy & securityterms of usehearthsong recommends fairy gardensolar star lantern ballscordless window candlesfirestarters & fatwoodsolar lightingfireplace screens gifts for himgifts for herwind spinnerssolar lightingfire potshome accentsactive play toysfairy dollsimaginative playfairy wings & maskshugglepodswaldorf dolls closet organizerssolar lightingkitchen gadgetskitchen organizationproblem solvershome gadgets lunch bags & boxesbento boxesreusable gift wrapsreusable water bottlesreusable shopping bagssilicone wine glassescopyright © 2014 hearthsong
