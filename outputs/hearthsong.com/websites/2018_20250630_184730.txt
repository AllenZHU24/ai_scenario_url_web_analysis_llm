to the community as it is to encourage positive play. whether it’s through donations of toys, money, labor, or our time, it’s important to us that we make a difference in other people’s lives, at a local, national, and even global level. after all, our kids are our future, and even a small act of kindness can make a huge difference. in the past, we’ve donated to help organizations such as the quad preparatory school, common ground adventures, toy lift, blue ridge area food bank, paul newman’s seriousfun children’s network, boys and girls club of america, culpeper housing and shelter services, comfort cases, novant health uva health system, and alex’s lemonade stand—as well as the 2015 haiti earthquake relief and the victims of hurricane harvey. in addition, every year we organize backpack drives and participate in the angel tree holiday partnership with the salvation army and madison emergency services association. in 2018, hearthsong made large toy donations to several organizations, including childhelp and head start. we’re always looking for new and creative ways to help others. if you would like to get in touch, please email service@hearthsong.com for more information special campaigns for more information, please visit toysfortots.org. for more than 40 years, the united states marine corps reserve toys for tots program has collected new, unwrapped toys for kids of family in need. ninety-seven percentof all funds directly support their mission of providing gifts for less fortunate children, and not a single donated dollar goes towards anyone’s salary. toys collected throughout the months of october, november, and december are then distributed at christmas. through this gift, toys for tots hopes to play an active role in helping our nation’s most valuable resource become better citizens, as well as help all kids experience the joy of christmas. for many years now, hearthsong has partnered with toys for tots to bring high-quality, active and creative toys to families in need, and will continue to do so going into the future. childhelp® childhelp is a nationwide organization that has been dedicated to helping abused, neglected, and at-risk children since the 1960s. with chapters all around the country, the organization offers a variety of resources, including prevention and education programs for families, teachers, and coaches, intervention programs, help hotlines, and residential treatment facilities (villages), which provide abused and neglected kids with a safe space to call home while they receive the help they need to heal. in 2018, hearthsong donated toys, musical instruments, games, and art supplies to the childhelp alice c. tyler village. since 1993, the village has provided a healing home environment with a community atmosphere for abused, neglected, and at-risk children ages 5 to 14 years of age. children who spend time at the village arrive with severe emotional and behavioral issues, but with a team of therapists and counselors to develop individualized treatment plans they learn to love themselves and trust others through comprehensive care. the village’s unique location on a 270-acre working ranch creates a variety of therapeutic resources, and each child has daily opportunities to participate in recreational activities such as animal care, horseback riding, hiking, biking, rope courses, team sports, swimming choir, go-karts, and more. for more information, visit childhelp.org or childhelp.org/virginia/the-village head start founded in 1965 by lyndon b. johnson’s war on poverty, head start is a national, government-funded program committed to helping young children from low-income families through agencies in their local community. with supported locations all over the country, head start services include early learning, health, and family care and support. proud to be able to help and support our local community, in 2018, hearthsong donated toys and books to the kids and classrooms at skyline cap head start. skyline cap, inc. is a non-profit community action agency (caa) designated by the governor of virginia and part of the head start initiative. located in madison, virginia and incorporated in 1990, the agency offers education and health services such as medical care, vision, dental, and nutrition to more than 175 preschool-aged children from families in need. every child who enrolls is evaluated and receives personalized care in the areas where they need it the most. by focusing on an individual’s needs, the head start program hopes to give children the “head start” they need to build skills of self-sufficiency. for more information, visit www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs or https://skylinecap.org/ most items can be returned within 90 days by mail. online return
