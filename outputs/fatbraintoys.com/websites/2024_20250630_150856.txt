orders are shipped from our warehouse in omaha, nebraska - smack dab in the middle of the country - so allow 3-4 business days shipping time to either coast using standard shipping. other locations will vary from 1 to 3 business days. available inventory we stock nearly every product that we sell...and we keep a lot of product in stock. unlike most online retailers, we like to give our customers as much information as we can so that they can feel confident in their buying decision. one such piece of information is actual stock levels. on each and every product page, you'll find a very accurate count of available inventory at that given moment. this should give you the confidence that not only is the item in stock, but we actually have "n" number of units available to ship. backordered & out of stock products if a product is listed as "backordered" or "currently on order", that means that we are waiting on a shipment from the manufacturer and will fulfill the order as soon as the item is received (usually less than one week). if a product is listed as "out of stock" or "not currently available for purchase", it means that we are indefinitely out of stock and cannot provide an estimated date of delivery. alaska, hawaii, u.s. territories, apo/fpo because ups ground is not always an option for these areas, we ship through the us postal service. unfortunately, when shipping usps, you'll need to allow several additional days for it to be shipped and we also do not have the granular level of tracking that we do with ups. international orders international shipping options are currently available through usps parcel post. after the sale support we're here to support you before and after your purchase. unlike some large online companies who will only communicate with you via email, we're always just a phone call away! just call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987 and let us know how we can help. po boxes please enter a physical address to take advantage of the $7.99 flat-rate shipping rate through ups. a po box may be used, however, your order will ship via usps according to the weight and size of the box. occasionally, in very rural or remote locations, ups can deliver to the local post office. in this case, please enter the physical address for the post office and enter the box number on the 2nd line. if the above doesn't answer your questions, we encourage you to either email us at cs@fatbraintoys.com or call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987. get exclusive deals & more!
