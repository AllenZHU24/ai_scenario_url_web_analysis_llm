click here for more information... as one of the top online toy retailers, we have access to unprecendented quantities of product review data. one of the key ways that we use this data is by associating our products to the specific ages and genders of the kids who are playing with them. whereas most retailers must rely upon manufacturer suggested ages (i.e. 3+), we take actual customer usage and share it with you here so that you can choose the perfect toy or game. but how does this help me? you can use these graphs as a general measure of it's appropriateness for a given age and gender. while this information is generally accurate, it should not be used as an absolute answer. for instance, many dinosaur toys are purchased for boys, however, that doesn't mean that it's inappropriate for a girl who happens to like dinosaurs. note: the orange color in the charts above indicate ages that are less than the manufacturer suggested age. please purchase at your discretion if your child is younger than 3 years of age. product specs toy value index toy iq click here to view our exclusive toy value index methodology... click here to view our exclusive toy iq methodology... upc 811802020697 manufacturer sku fa095-1 date added to fat brain toys 6/19/2014 manufactured in china manufacturer recommended minimum age 3 years fat brain toys monthly sales ranking #4 dimension 28 x 11.5 x 7.5 inches weight limit 110 lbs special perspectives we've collected valuable feedback from our customers on how this item is being used by children with special needs in hopes of providing guidance for other special needs caregivers. click here to view these "special perspectives"... identified special needs challenges: add/adhd, aspergers, autism, developmental delay, sensory integration disorder “my special needs students loved the teeter popper. they sat, layed on and twirled on it for as long as it was out. one of my students turned it over and pretended it was a turtle shell. the popping sound was enjoyable to the children as well. ” product reviews total customer reviews: 124 average customer rating: 4.76 (site average 4.57) 96 ratings (click here to view) 26 ratings (click here to view) 2 ratings (click here to view) super fun toy! posted yesterday by melissa brandt rating: 5 my kids (ages (3, 5 and 6) all love this toy! i ordered it for a few reasons: they love the sound of popping bubble wrap and we have hard wood floors that it would rock and "pop" on very well, they are 3 very active little boys who need movement on those cold winter days when they may not get outside, and it will increase their gross motor skills as they try to balance on this toy. 1 of 1 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) perfect christmas gift! posted 4 days ago by millie welch rating: 5 i was looking for a toy for my 3year old grandson that would offer some exercise indoors and was also fun. after much research i decided to purchase the teeter-popper. this is my first purchase from fat brain toys. i wish i could attach a picture of him opening it...he was excited from the get go! once opened. he didn't need any help in figuring out what to do with it. he would rock back and forth than bend over to see which popper was stuck. when his brothers would try to take a turn he would not let them. "mine!" it is very sturdy but light enough that he had no problem carrying it around...which he did often. 1 of 1 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) teeter poppers and preschoolers posted 25 days ago by nicole bailey rating: 5 we have a class of 12 preschool children, ranging in age from 3 to 5 years. we chose three teeter poppers for the balancing activity, core strength building, sensory stimulation, and active movement play potential of the toys. these are chosen and used daily by our group, they've been imagined to be boats, surf boards, baby cradles, rocking chairs, hammocks, sick beds, and flying saucers. our kids love the sound that the popping suction cups make when they rock, and interestingly, the suction cups actually add a bit of stability for when some of our younger and less stable users decide to give them a try. while we cannot attest to the durability of the pieces or the poppers long-term, because we have had them such a short time, we have high expectations. we love that they toy is active and sturdy and open-ended, and the only regret we have is that we didn't buy 4 of them :) 5 of 5 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) customer satisfaction review posted 10/5/2016 by robert bruce rating: 4 this choice is totally anticipated. i bought this item as a present for my grandson's 3rd birthday which will not take place until saturday, 10/15/16. judging from your product video that i watched coupled with knowing my grandson's personality and demeanor, i expect him to play with it a lot. it seems to be very durable, easy to store, and keep clean. if it turns out that he is not happy or satisfied with it, i will certainly let your customer service department know that as well. thanks. 2 of 3 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) teeter popper and fat brain oh my posted 9/6/2016 by penina hoffnung rating: 5 i'm the director of congregational learning at a conservative synagogue. i had a very specific mission. after our worship services on our sabbath we have a luncheon. kids eat quickly, parents eat slowly and want to socialize. the kids as a result, run through the synagogue looking to play and left off steam and...well, let's just say it wasn't pretty. so i was searching for a toy that was a large-muscle kind of play, but not a driving/riding toy--which wouldn't be within our rules about sabbath and suitable for use indoors, and that would suit a range of ages from toddler through age 11 or so and something that they would think was so cool, it would keep them from running amok in the synagogue. ...i saw this toy on pinterest first i think, and through that found fatbrain and it was so serendipitous. so far the teeter popper has met all my criteria and more. 4 of 4 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) awesome tody posted 8/4/2016 by rachel k rating: 5 my nephew is 5 and received this for his birthday. he was able to use it by himself after only being shown how to teeter on it once. he loved the popping sounds and, i have to admit, i did too! i thought it might be a noisemaker that would drive everyone crazy, but it's actually kind of pleasant to listen to....and he loved the rocking motion too. 5 of 6 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?
