contact us submit products welcome to fat brain toys! as you peruse fat brain toys, you may find something missing. in fact, if you're accustomed to the toy selection found at most stores, you may find lots of items missing. missing are the licensed, violent, cheaply made toys that end up in the trash can shortly after being played with by your child. but what you will find instead are thousands of quality, open-ended toys, games, and gifts that entertain and educate. for over 13 years, we've been carefully choosing the best toys from around the world in addition to aquiring the single largest selection of american-made toys found anywhere. but our unparalleled selection of quality toys is just one of many reasons that makes fat brain toys unique: we provide toll-free support by our award-winning toy experts before and after the sale we stock nearly every product we sell from our own centrally-located warehouse most in-stock orders are shipped within 24 hours (if not faster!) we ship orders worldwide including military apo's & fpo's but more than anything, we are still a small, family owned and operated business that takes great pride in our ability to offer exceptional service to each and every customer. we hope to count you among our satisfied customers soon! mark & karen carson founders fat brain toys learn a bit more about the fat brain toys philosophy through these videos... for businesses click here we accept purchase orders! are you looking for solutions for education & childcare, businesses, non-profits or government agencies?
