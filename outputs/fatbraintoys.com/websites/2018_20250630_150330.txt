we also offer competitive shipping rates to alaska, hawaii, puerto rico and to most locations world-wide. with our gratitude, we offer half-price shipping to all military apo/fpo orders. manufacturer direct ship orders are not eligible for our flat rate shipping offer. no discount code is required to take advantage of this flat rate shipping offer. simply proceed through the checkout process and your available shipping rates will be displayed. additional shipping information express shipping options ups ground is our standard method of shipping which can vary from 1-5 business days for delivery. however, we also offer you the opportunity to use ups' express shipment options, including 3-day select, 2nd day air, and next day air. in fact, we discount all three express options to make them a more affordable option. if you don't mind paying a few extra dollars, 3-day select and 2nd day air are great options for insuring timely delivery. shipping information orders placed for in-stock items by 3:00 p.m. cst will be shipped the same day. orders placed after 3:00 p.m. will be shipped the next business day. orders are shipped from our warehouse in omaha, nebraska - smack dab in the middle of the country - so allow 3-4 business days shipping time to either coast using standard shipping, while other locations will vary from 1 to 3 business days. the best way to estimate the arrival date is to use our shipping calculator found on each and every product page. simply fill in your zip code and we will give you a very accurate estimate of when we think you should receive your order. available inventory we stock nearly every product that we sell...and we keep a lot of product in stock. unlike most online retailers, we like to give our customers as much information as we can so that they can feel confident in their buying decision. one such piece of information is actual stock levels. on each and every product page, you'll find a very accurate count of available inventory at that given moment. this should give you the confidence that not only is the item in stock, but we actually have "n" number of units available to ship. backordered & out of stock products if a product is listed as "backordered" or "currently on order", that means that we are waiting on a shipment from the manufacturer and will fulfill the order as soon as the item is received (usually less than one week). if a product is listed as "out of stock" or "not currently available for purchase", it means that we are indefinitely out of stock and cannot provide an estimated date of delivery. alaska, hawaii, u.s. territories, apo/fpo because ups ground is not an option for these areas, we ship through the us postal service. unfortunately, when shipping usps, you'll need to allow several additional days for it to be shipped and we also do not have the granular level of tracking that we do with ups. international orders international shipping options are currently available through usps parcel post. after the sale support we're here to support you before and after your purchase. unlike some large online companies who will only communicate with you via email, we're always just a phone call away! just call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987 and let us know how we can help. if the above doesn't answer your questions, we encourage you to either email us at cs@fatbraintoys.com or call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987. get exclusive deals & more! subscribe customer service customer service contact us order status return authorization faqs toy safety info privacy policy about us about us our story mission stores our causes testimonials wholesale join our team shop shop coming soon birthday gift ideas top kids toys new toys for kids christmas toys toy catalog best toys by age connect extras play blog for business educators extra credit birthday concierge special needs websrv10.fbtdc.com copyright © 2003-2018 fat brain holdings llc. all rights reserved.fat brain toys® is a registered service mark of fat brain holdings llc error: an error has occured, please try again. if the problem persists contact customer service at 1-800-590-5987 close
