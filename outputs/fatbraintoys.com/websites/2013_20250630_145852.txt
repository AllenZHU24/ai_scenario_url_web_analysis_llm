click here for more information... as one of the top online toy retailers, we have access to unprecendented quantities of product review data. one of the key ways that we use this data is by associating our products to the specific ages and genders of the kids who are playing with them. whereas most retailers must rely upon manufacturer suggested ages (i.e. 3+), we take actual customer usage and share it with you here so that you can choose the perfect toy or game. but how does this help me? you can use these graphs as a general measure of it's appropriateness for a given age and gender. while this information is generally accurate, it should not be used as an absolute answer. for instance, many dinosaur toys are purchased for boys, however, that doesn't mean that it's inappropriate for a girl who happens to like dinosaurs. note: the orange color in the charts above indicate ages that are less than the manufacturer suggested age. please purchase at your discretion if your child is younger than 4 years of age. toy value index 9.54 click here to view our exclusive toy value index methodology... toy iq 177 high genius click here to view our exclusive toy iq methodology... upc 000772029407 manufacturer sku 2940 date added to fat brain toys 3/21/2006 manufactured in peoples republic of china manufacturer recommended minimum age 4 years fat brain toys monthly sales ranking #13 warning:choking hazard - small parts. not for children under 3 yrs. we've collected valuable feedback from our customers on how this item is being used by children with special needs in hopes of providing guidance for other special needs caregivers. click here to view these "special perspectives"... identified special needs challenges: speech & language delay "we really focus on the letters, their sounds, other words that make those sounds. my son mixes up b's and d's this toy is really helping him identify the difference between those two letters. this toy is helping him learn both visually and hands-on." identified special needs challenges: apraxia, autism, developmental delay, speech & language delay "i like that there are two words on one panel. i take the panel, show one side and ask my nephew what the image is. i flip to the other side and ask him the same question. then i ask him which image he would like to spell. he really likes the visual then spelling aspect of the puzzle, and he seems to love that there are options for him." identified special needs challenges: apraxia, autism, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, learning disabilities, sensory integration disorder, speech & language delay "needs to be either marine quality paint on figures and letters or made of a polyurethane that will not deteriorate after extended use. our grandson played so hard with it that some of the paint was already gone before the end of the day." identified special needs challenges: autism "it is a good re-enforcement tool. he loved it and caught on fast.

(report abuse) my rating of see & spell posted 12 days ago by siri stenberg rating: 4 my 4 year old is enrolled in a montessori preschool, and has materials like the see and spell at her school. she just loves them, so i got this one for at home. it's so fun to hear her sounding out the letters as she spells the words! my only criticism is that the pictures don't separate from the words. she is rapidly getting to a point where if the pictures came apart from the words, she could spell the words out, then match them to the picture. 1 of 1 customers found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you?
