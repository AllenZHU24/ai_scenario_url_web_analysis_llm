we offer $7.99 flat-rate shipping on any inventoried items shipped to locations within the contiguous united states. one item or 10 items...it's still just $7.99 for the entire order! even better, if your subtotal is over $99, you will qualify for free standard shipping. if you also have a promo code, you can still use it, however, if the discount lowers your subtotal below $99, you will no longer qualify for free shipping. the free shipping only applies to our standard shipping option, which means drop-ship items and orders shipped outside of the 48 contiguous united states do not qualify. we also offer competitive shipping rates to alaska, hawaii, puerto rico, and to most locations world-wide. with our gratitude, we offer half-price shipping to all military apo/fpo orders. manufacturer direct ship orders are not eligible for our flat-rate shipping offer. no discount code is required to take advantage of this flat-rate shipping offer. simply proceed through the checkout process and your available shipping rates will be displayed. additional shipping information express shipping options our standard method of shipping can vary from 2-6 business days for delivery. however, we also offer you the opportunity to use ups's express shipment options, including 3-day select, 2nd day air, and next day air. in fact, we discount all three express options to make them a more affordable option. if you don't mind paying a few extra dollars, 3-day select and 2nd day air are great options for ensuring timely delivery. shipping information order today for shipment within 24 hours! orders are shipped from our warehouse in omaha, nebraska - smack dab in the middle of the country - so allow 3-4 business days shipping time to either coast using standard shipping. other locations will vary from 1 to 3 business days. available inventory we stock nearly every product that we sell...and we keep a lot of product in stock. unlike most online retailers, we like to give our customers as much information as we can so that they can feel confident in their buying decision. one such piece of information is actual stock levels. on each and every product page, you'll find a very accurate count of available inventory at that given moment. this should give you the confidence that not only is the item in stock, but we actually have "n" number of units available to ship. po boxes please enter a physical address to take advantage of the $7.99 flat-rate shipping rate through ups. a po box may be used, however, your order will ship via usps according to the weight and size of the box. occasionally, in very rural or remote locations, ups can deliver to the local post office. in this case, please enter the physical address for the post office and enter the box number on the 2nd line. backordered & out of stock products if a product is listed as "backordered" or "currently on order", that means that we are waiting on a shipment from the manufacturer and will fulfill the order as soon as the item is received (usually less than one week). if a product is listed as "out of stock" or "not currently available for purchase", it means that we are indefinitely out of stock and cannot provide an estimated date of delivery. alaska, hawaii, u.s. territories, apo/fpo because ups ground is not an option for these areas, we ship through the us postal service. unfortunately, when shipping usps, you'll need to allow several additional days for it to be shipped and we also do not have the granular level of tracking that we do with ups. international orders international shipping options are currently available through usps parcel post. after the sale support we're here to support you before and after your purchase. unlike some large online companies who will only communicate with you via email, we're always just a phone call away!
