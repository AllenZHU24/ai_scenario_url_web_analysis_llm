click here for more information... as one of the top online toy retailers, we have access to unprecendented quantities of product review data. one of the key ways that we use this data is by associating our products to the specific ages and genders of the kids who are playing with them. whereas most retailers must rely upon manufacturer suggested ages (i.e. 3+), we take actual customer usage and share it with you here so that you can choose the perfect toy or game. but how does this help me? you can use these graphs as a general measure of it's appropriateness for a given age and gender. while this information is generally accurate, it should not be used as an absolute answer. for instance, many dinosaur toys are purchased for boys, however, that doesn't mean that it's inappropriate for a girl who happens to like dinosaurs. note: the orange color in the charts above indicate ages that are less than the manufacturer suggested age. please purchase at your discretion if your child is younger than 1 years of age. toy value index 9.71 click here to view our exclusive toy value index methodology... toy iq 176 high genius click here to view our exclusive toy iq methodology... upc 811802020635 manufacturer sku fa089-1 date added to fat brain toys 9/25/2013 manufactured in peoples republic of china manufacturer recommended minimum age 6 months fat brain toys monthly sales ranking #8 total customer reviews: 59 average customer rating: 4.59 (site average 4.56) 41 ratings (click here to view) 13 ratings (click here to view) 4 ratings (click here to view) 1 ratings (click here to view) the following "cloud" is a semantic representation of our customers' general impression of pipsquigz. the larger the text, the more frequently that term is used to describe it. fun cup good hit forehead table time hold baby restaurants likes easy gift love teething perfect chair little great birthday squigz noise high make loves brother rattle stick suction cups squidz ladrge and small posted 4 days ago by grace peirce rating: 4 i have a small family childcare and the the children range in agefro 3 months to age 3. the smaller ones are most popular with all the children. was this review helpful to you?

(report abuse) pipsquigz toy posted 8/10/2014 by sharon rating: 5 this toy was given by me to my one year old grandson and this was a great choice. it consists of three individual rubber toys that have suction cups on the bottom to adhere to high chair trays, tables, strollers and so forth. the suction is great, not flimsy at all. our little guy needs to have something to entertain him while his food is being prepared or while the rest of the family is having dinner and he has finished. this product does that task! the size and shape are perfect for little hands and mouths. fat brain toys are the best. good quality and some toys that you do not find elsewhere. was this review helpful to you? (report abuse) pipsquiz posted 8/10/2014 rating: 5 pipsquizs were given as a birthday present for a one year old. after the party when he could focus on his gifts, the baby gravitated to the pipsquizs. he seemed to like the bright colors and we loved that he could chew on them without any damage to the toy or to the baby. his cousin showed him how to attach them to his high chair tray and to pop them off. he loved that idea and continued to play with it for a reasonable amount of time for his age. this gift will be helpful when dining out with the family. other parents in attendance were impressed with this gift. i will purchase a set of squigz for the baby's older brother, age 4, since he was enthralled with the toy as well. was this review helpful to you?
