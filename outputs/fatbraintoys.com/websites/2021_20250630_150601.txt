at one end of the spectrum, pediatric brain cancer can negatively impact or destroy a child's ability to love, speak, see, run, balance, create, and laugh. at the other end of the spectrum, fat brain toys' mission to provide "a smarter way to play" seeks to strengthen a child's abilities in verbal skills, visual acuity, balance, sensory discernment, nurturing, creating, building, and problem-solving. building these skills and the foundations of your personality are essential for human growth, and tumors that strike this still-maturing organ can be devastating. any disease that compromises a child's ability to grow, learn, and live impacts us deeply. and so, partnering with the team jack foundation to help defeat pediatric brain cancer was a logical choice for us. our company and our employees have taken this important cause to heart, and we hope you decide to join team jack. the fat brain toys family, including co-founders mark and karen carson, proudly present a $20,000 donation to jack hoffman of team jack. who is jack and what is team jack all about? the team jack foundation is comprised of hardworking team members directly impacted by the disease and committed to fighting it. the foundation was formed in atkinson, nebraska, during jack hoffman's battle against cancer. initially diagnosed at the age of six in 2011, jack has undergone two life-threatening surgeries, chemotherapy, remission, relapse, and immunotherapy. his family started the foundation so that, while he continues to fight, team jack continues to raise funds for research. watch: jack hoffman, of team jack, scores a touchdown during the 2013 nebraska cornhusker spring game. how can you help?
