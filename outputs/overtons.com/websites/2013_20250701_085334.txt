advice & tips > towable inflation towable inflation how much air is the right amount? in general, the tube is full when it is very firm. covered tubes should be wrinkle free. an adult should be able to stand on the tube and only sink a couple of inches. under-inflation: causes the tow tube to sit low in the water. additional stress is applied to the tube, cover, rope and boat, by being dragged through the water instead of pulled across it. this stress causes the air in tubes to be displaced and the tube may rupture. this same stress causes nylon covers to tear and ropes to stretch. the boat cannot plane off and extra gas is consumed. pumps first, it is important to know that tubes do not require high pressure; they are low pressure / high volume products. if you could measure the pressure in a fully inflated tube, it would be around 2 psi. most towable tubes can be inflated using one good electric pump or a combination of 12 volt and hand pumps. some of the newer 12-volt inflators have been designed specifically to inflate beds or tubes, but will still not fully inflate some of the bigger tubes now on the market. (most 12-volt compressors, while doing an excellent job of filling a bicycle or car tire, do not have the volume capacity to inflate many towables.) if you are filling your toys at the lake, some of the bigger tubes on the market require a hand pump in addition to the 12-volt inflator that plugs into your boat's cigarette lighter. the inflator will do most of the hard work, and the hand pump can be used to top off the tube and maintain proper inflation levels. another suggestion is a power inverter. they have become much less expensive, and are an excellent way to power 110-volt appliances on or near the water. for tubers that live on the lake, or have access to 110-volt power, a good 110-volt inflator is a must have! other 110-volt options are shop vacs with a blower option and leaf blowers, which put out large volumes of air. valve: most sportsstuff towables use what is called a speed safety valve for inflation and deflation. the opening on a speed safety valve is about the size of a nickel, and uses a simple one-way valve to keep air from escaping. simply insert the nozzle of the inflator into the opening on the valve and inflate. maintenance: finally, it is not enough to simply fill it up and go! if you leave a full tube sitting in the sun for any length of time, it will expand. either store it in the shade, or let some air out. don't let it sit on the beach, dock, or boat full of air! at the same time, if it is stored out of the sun in a cool place, you may need to add air. check and adjust inflation levels each time you use your tube. you'll have more fun, and your toys will last longer. stay connected like us on facebook follow us on twitter watch us on youtube catalog request a free catalog shop our ecatalog email sign up to receive exclusiveoffers and updates go view this week's email gift cards buy a gift card check your balance help & support customer service shipping info international returns & exchanges catalog quick order contact us live help advice & tips wetsuit sizing glove sizing bimini top measuring tube inflation propeller selection watersports responsibility code all advice & tips company the overton’s way company history retail stores careers affiliates site map current promotions our sites gandermountain.com gandermtnacademy.com threeforksranch.com overton'scredit card learn more get recognized share your pictures of life on the water. share now top search terms: lights, pontoon, ladders, mirrors, tubes, batteries, speakers, rope, flags, fenders, fuel tanks, grills top categories: boat seats, life vests, towables, bimini tops, outlet, marine stereos, lake & pool leisure go © 2003-2013 overton's. all rights reserved. 1-800-334-6541•terms & conditions•privacy policy•brands
