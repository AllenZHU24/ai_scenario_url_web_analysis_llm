p. sprangerhereford, arizona date added: friday 05 october, 2012 hello, i like to start off that this is my first website for airsoft products and i have to say after going to a lot of other websites and checking them out page by page; the airsoftgi site is the site for me! great deals and unbeatable prices for great quality! all the events you plan out are amazing, though i wish i could attend them my friends tell me how great of hosts and planning the events are and they rate them number #1 for huge group events! i started airsofting when i was 10 and i enjoyed outdoor sports. the stimulation of live action roles in airsoft is the only outdoor sport i enjoy the most. i do love the g36 series and the m4 series of course! they are my most popular favourite. started getting into a favorited motive to gas blow-back products now and want to highly consider getting one. anyway, great job and i really appreciate what every member on this group do to make everything happen for all those enthusiasts and or people who just love to go out and play safe and play hard! patrick spranger sierra vista az, 85635 d. hektorjohnson city, new york date added: friday 21 september, 2012 i love airsoftgi, ive bought probably about $1000 worth of guns and gear over the years, always happy with the service. and this latest purchase was no exception. i ordered a g&g combat machine m4 and just after i ordered it they put it on sale for $30 less. i emailed gi support and that night i had an email from harrison letting me know that i would be refunded the difference and asking what form i wanted it in. because of that ill be buying a pistol mag with the difference and probably a new gun for my friend very soon too. just another reason that airsoft gi keeps me coming back. thanks airsoft gi!!!! e. evensensnoqualmie, washington date added: thursday 20 september, 2012 we just received outstanding customer service from harrison and wanted to let you know about it. we had trouble with assembly (believe me it was us, not the gun!). he was incredibly patient and helpful. he created and posted a video for us showing the battery installation. it instantly solved our problem. excellent customer service. thank you!
