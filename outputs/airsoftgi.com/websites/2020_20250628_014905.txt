canada-legal airsoft guns for use by our neighbors up north. whether youre looking to upgrade to a high-tech, electric airsoft gun or prefer an old-school manual spring style, airsoft gi can help you find the perfect gun. electric airsoft guns electric airsoft guns, also known as aegs, are the most common type of airsoft guns. these airsoft guns are battery-powered and can usually be fired in semi or fully automatic mode. typically firing at a velocity between 350 fps and 400 fps with 0.20g bbs, electric airsoft guns are similar to spring-powered airsoft guns but dont require you to manually cock the gun, instead relying on battery power to fire. these guns can replicate popular styles such as m4 or ak47 rifles. we sell this style in various kits with select models that come with a rechargeable battery and a battery charger so you get everything you need to get started as soon as the gun arrives at your door. gas airsoft guns gas airsoft guns are also a popular option, but instead of using battery power, they use compressed gas to shoot airsoft bbs, similar to paintball guns. we have both green gas and co2 powered airsoft guns, many of which provide a realistic blowback feature that gives you the feeling and sensation of shooting a real gun. they even replicate the appearance and form of real guns like the glock and 1911. external and internal part customization is a popular option for fans of hi-capa gas airsoft pistols too! if you love the pistol style, then a gas airsoft gun is probably a good choice for you. spring airsoft guns spring airsoft guns use a simple, spring-powered mechanism that allows you to manually cock and shoot the gun. simply pull back the slide (for pistols) or the bolt (for rifles) before each shot. there are also many powerful spring-powered sniper rifles available in our vast selection for long range gameplay. these are typically longer than most basic types of airsoft guns in the market. overall, these make great entry-level weapons for those who are just getting started in the sport, or players who enjoy the challenge of a single shot airsoft gun. airsoft grenades launchers, grenades and more when one bb at a time simply isnt going to cut it, its time to break out the special toys. the airsoft hobby is full of amazing options to back up your airsoft gun such as airsoft grenades, grenade launchers and trap options like claymore mines. these options can be spring or gas powered, and come in a variety of sizes and price points to fit your needs. airsoft bbs the bb is the life and blood of airsoft. airsoft bbs are used in all the airsoft guns and accessories that intend to expel shots at your opponents. make sure your airsoft gun is only shooting the highest quality ammo to ensure maximum accuracy. we carry a wide array of bbs from .12g, .20g, .25g, and more heavy grade sniper weights like .40 and .46g bbs. there are biodegradable bbs we carry at airsoft gi for fields or events that require it for reducing harm to the environment! batteries, chargers, and gas making sure your airsoft gun has the necessary power to propel your bbs at a target is essential to stay on top of your game. we have a wide selection of batteries, chargers and gas to make sure you can shoot your gun throughout the day. from 8.4v and 9.6v ni-cad and nimh batteries to 7.4v and 11.v lipo and li-ion
