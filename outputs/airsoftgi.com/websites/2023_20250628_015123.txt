airsoft is a team sport where players compete against each other while using airsoft guns. airsoft as a sport is very similar to paintball with the exception being that each player uses an airsoft gun that shoots bbs in the place of paintballs. the bbs do not leave any visible marks on the players making it easier to maintain their airsoft gear and clothing. what are airsoft guns? airsoft guns are replicas of guns made to look realistic and shoot small pellets. airsoft gun replicas can bear a high resemblance to real guns, and are favored by gun enthusiasts for this reason. airsoft guns are also used for military & law enforcement training because of how realistic they look. however, airsoft guns offer a safer alternative since they are non-lethal. the primary identifying feature for an airsoft gun would be the orange nozzle located at the tip of the airsoft gun barrel. who is airsoft gi?
