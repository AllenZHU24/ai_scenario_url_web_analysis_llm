bosch oxygen sensor prevents this from happening. the bosch oxygen sensor detects the amount of oxygen in the fuel and sends that information to the engine's control computer. based on the data from the bosh oxygen sensor, the computer calculates the current air to fuel ratio and instructs the fuel injectors to either add more or less fuel to the combustion chamber. the bosch oxygen sensor sends this info several times a second. if your oxygen sensor is malfunctioning, the check engine light will alert you to the problem, and for an affordable amount of money, you can obtain a new bosch oxygen sensor, especially when you do business with us, ordering via our secure website or toll-free number. featured bosch parts a/c condenser fan motora/c e.t.r. switcha/c relaya/c servoa/c
