the answer is simple--it wouldn't even have automotive equipment to sell and a name to begin with. robert bosch, then a 25-year old electrician, created a magneto ignition device for a stationary engine that later became the company's key product, which launched its century-long career.camille jenatzybosch's history isn't just made up of people who invent spark plugs and tweak cars. there are also those people who drive their way into the company's history. one of the earliest to do this was camille jenatzy. jenatzy was a belgian race car driver nicknamed le diable rouge ("the red devil"). he was also one of bosch's go-to advertisers, with cartoonish posters littered with his red beard. but aside from representing bosch in print, jenatzy also helped established the brand's reputation in the circuit by winning the 1903 gordon bennett race in ireland in a bosch ignition system-equipped mercedes.frederick simms and arnold zähringer the bosch company is often associated with continuous automotive innovation. but in its earlier years, the company found itself stuck in a rut. in1897, after installing magneto ignition devices on vehicle engines, english engineer frederick simms came to him with a proposition--install a magneto ignition device in a de dion-bouton three-wheeler. but with the more powerful, high-speed engine of the three-wheeler, the device was no longer a suitable upgrade. it was arnold zähringer, bosch's factory manager that solved the then-small-supplier's problem. he fitted a weight metal sleeve and laid it around the armature on the engine to increase the ignition's sparks per minute. featured bosch parts a/c condenser fan motor a/c e.t.r. switch a/c relay a/c servo a/c temperature switch abs control unit abs pump abs relay abs repair kit abs speed sensor acc cabin filter acc cabin filter set acc mono valve air mass meter air mass sensor air pump air temperature sensor alternator alternator bracket bushing alternator mount bushing alternator pulley alternator seal altitude sensor auxiliary air valve auxiliary cooling fan auxiliary fan assembly auxiliary fan motor auxiliary fan resistor auxiliary water pump ballast resistor blower motor boost pressure sensor brake booster brake booster check valve brake caliper brake disc bulb socket camshaft position sensor charge air bypass valve co adjustment plug cold start valve condenser wire convertible top motor coolant temperature sensor corner light crank position sensor diesel injector diesel injector nozzle distributor cam lube distributor cap distributor dust cover distributor o-ring distributor parts kit distributor rotor e.h.a. valve electronic control unit engine temperature sensor fog light fog light lens fog light lens guard frequency valve fuel accumulator fuel dist valve kit fuel distributor fuel distributor o-ring fuel filter fuel filter seal fuel injector fuel injector o-ring fuel injector seal fuel injector seal kit fuel level sending unit fuel pressure damper fuel pressure regulator fuel pressure regulator o-ring fuel pump fuel pump assembly fuel pump check valve fuel pump gasket fuel strainer fuse generator generator brush set glow plug glow plug insulator glow plug kit glow plug relay hall sender headlight headlight door headlight frame headlight lens headlight rim headlight seal headlight washer nozzle headlight wiper arm headlight wiper blade headlight wiper insert headlight wiper motor heater temp sensor heater valve horn idle control valve ignition coil ignition condenser ignition control unit ignition distributor ignition module ignition points ignition wire ignition wire end plug ignition wire set impulse sender impulse sensor impulse sensor insulator impulse transmitter injection pump diaphram injection pump solenoid injector hose repair kit knock sensor longitudinal acceleration sensor map sensor mono valve repair kit oil filter overrun cut off valve oxygen sensor pickup coil position sensor o-ring preglow time relay pressure valve seal primer pump primer pump assembly purge valve reference sensor relay seal ring shut off valve shut off valve gasket spark plug spark plug connector spark plug gap gauge starter starter drive starter relay starter solenoid sunroof motor suppressor cover suppressor housing switch thermo time switch throttle actuator throttle body throttle position sensor throttle switch trigger points turbo cut off valve turn signal bulb socket turn signal lens turn signal light vacuum advance unit vacuum supply pump voltage regulator warm up regulator washer check valve water pump window motor windshield wiper arm windshield wiper motor wiper blade wiper blade adapter wiper blade insert wiper blade insert set wiper blade set wiper linkage need help?
