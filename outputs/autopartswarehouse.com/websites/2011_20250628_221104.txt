sheets as a idea of the performance you might expect but keep in mind your individual vehicle results may be different. testimonials domestic performance information introduction jet performance products are developed at our state of the art facility in huntington beach, california using the latest dynamometer techniques and computer monitoring equipment to insure all jet chips and modules are tuned for the maximum torque and horsepower gains throughout the rpm band. the programming changes to each jet chip are extensive and include modified spark advance tables, air fuel ratio modification, torque converter lockup (in automatics), shift improvement in electronic automatic transmission and various other parameters to optimize the torque and horsepower curve for each individual application. chassis dynamometer tuning allows jet to develop a specific program for each application. every vehicle is first tested in a stock configuration to get baseline dynamometer and track times. to do this the vehicle is connected to jet's custom data acquisition system to monitor various sensors. engine temperature, spark advance and air/fuel ratios, all this data is then recorded and stored away for later comparison. from there we start to modify the spark advance and fuel curve in 500 rpm increments until we achieve the maximum torque and horsepower at the drive wheels in each rpm and load range, this allows turning under all types of various driving conditions and not just wide open throttle, a decisive advantage to the jet chip! all the data is stored on disk and transferred to the jet chip program so thorough track and street testing can be done under "real world driving conditions" to assure the dyno results prove out on the road in decreased 0-60 mph times and quicker ¼ miles acceleration. what does a jet chip/module do? today's vehicle use various types of computers, some have chips that are easily removable, others do not. not to worry, jet has a chip, module or computer upgrade to fit almost every application on the road today. the ecm in the vehicle looks at various sensors such as manifold vacuum, coolant temperature, throttle position and rpm, it then processes this information and adjusts spark timing, air/fuel ratio and other parameter according to the tables stored in the jet performance chip/module memory. by recalibrating these tables we are able to tune the engine for the maximum horsepower and torque under various driving conditions. by installing the jet chip or module these extra increases in performance enhance drivability, towing capabilities, reduce ¼ miles times and provide improved overall efficiency. selecting the correct jet chip stage 1:if you have a stock engine with no other modification, this is the chip for you. the jet stage 1 performance chip is programmed for maximum power increases on a stock vehicle for improved performance under hard throttle conditions such as towing and wide open throttle acceleration.*special note: stage 1 chips are street legal in all 50 states. *carb eo#d-234-4 stage 2:designed for modified vehicles with low restriction exhaust and low temperature thermostat. the jet stage 2 performance chip has been calibrated for peak horsepower in cases where the engine has been modified to run cooler and the exhaust system is less restrictive than original equipment.*special note: stage ii chips are street legal in all 50 states. *carb e0#d-234-4 powr-shift:for the ultimate in performance the powrshift combines a stage2 with an aggressive

click on any of the icons below to view or hide each topic. selecting the correct jet chip jet performance products has become the foremost leader in domestic power tuning and has become known worldwide for its tuning ability in domestic applications. to compliment our extensive line of domestic performance chips, we decided 7 years ago the next logical step would be import computer upgrades. our dedicated team of engineers, technicians and some very helpful factory people embarked on a 7 year journey to develop the best line of import computer upgrades available tod what is it?the jet custom computer upgrade kit for import application, provides you with all the necessary information and materials to send your computer to jet for a custom software upgrade for your specific vehicle and modifications. why do i have to send my computer to jet?import, neon and saturn vehicles do not have computer chips that are easily removed as in most domestic vehicles. therefore it is necessary for jet engineers to either reprogram the existing chip or remove and replace it by desoldering it from the circuit board. what will it do for my vehicle?the upgrade will provide horsepower increases and improved acceleration. unlike other brands jet's exclusive dynamic spectrum tuning (dst) provides power increases all the time, not just at wide open throttle. in addition, by having the computer in our lab, the jet engineers can custom program the chip for any other modifications you have done to the vehicle. how long does it take?if we receive the computer at our facility by 12:00 pm pst we will return ship it to you the same day via overnight service. shipping your computerwe recommend using one of the overnight services such as ups red label, fed ex or airborne express. included in the purchase price jet will return your upgrade computer to you via airborne express or ups next day air service. e.c.u. location chart acura integra '90-'93 located under the
