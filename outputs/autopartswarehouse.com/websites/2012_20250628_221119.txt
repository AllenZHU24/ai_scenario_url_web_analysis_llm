"they always have the parts i need" i sometimes spend hours shopping around for the best price, and always find it at this store. they always have the parts i need none of my local auto stores has the inventory network that these guys do. i recently purchased a control arm for a saab, my local napa could not get this part, the dealer wanted 2.5x the price. jrcaleb posted march 10, 2011 "price was half the cost of my local auto parts stores" this is my second time i have ordered from this web-site and it went very easy and fast. the first time i ordered a catalytic convertor it came in a timely fashion and good condition. price was half the cost of my local auto parts stores.this second order was also delivered in a timely manner. product's in perfect condition. i would recommend this to anyone who can wait a few days and like to save money!! dtanderson posted march 10, 2011 "a+++ all the way around" awsome selection and amazingly easy to find the parts for you vehicle. free shipping and great pricing. a+++ all the way around locuus posted march 10, 2011 "good quality parts, great price and fast shipping" good quality parts, great price and fast shipping. what else can i say. those are the 3 things i look for when doing business. this not my first time ordering from these guys, nor will it be the last. every time they have shipped the correct parts on time. every time i need auto parts i find they have the best price. andyzewski posted march 08, 2011 "i couldn't be happier with auto parts warehouse" this retailer is great. it's easy to search for what your looking for, easy to check-out and i received my merchandise in less than a week. they had lower prices than any of my local auto parts stores and even had free shipping. the descriptions on their web-site were detailed enough to find exactly what i wanted. i couldn't be happier with auto parts warehouse! seankeating007 posted march 06, 2011 "delivery time frame was amazing" the parts that i ordered from auto parts warehouse were easy to locate on their website, extremely affordable, and the delivery time frame was amazing. after receiving my order, i was able to confirm both the accuracy of the order as well as the quality of the product. i would strongly recommend this service to anyone looking for parts for any car. franchise posted march 06, 2011 "great product which fit perfectly" outstanding service. great product which fit perfectly. after service followup was excellent! highly recommend and i'll definitely use again. rare to find such excellence. nice! dl383ster posted march 05, 2011 "i'll tell ya, this store has it all, the best selection you could ask for" i'll tell ya, this store has it all, the best selection you could ask for, it helps if you know a little about cars and what you need to order because the reps who answer the phones do not seem to know that much about auto parts, as far as selection one of the best ive ever seen, i ordered a transmission for my 97 chevy silverado pick up, and brake pads and rotors for my 94 acura integra no problems with the parts and over 23% savings on the cost, i would recommend getting your auto parts from this store sanderson0203 posted march 01, 2011 "apw had the best prices not to mention fast and free shipping" i was looking for brake drums for my wife's gmc sierra and apw had the best prices not to mention fast and free shipping. after the install everything went together as it should and i could not be happier. if you need parts look no further, this is your site! tobinsdad posted february 28, 2011 "the part was exactly right for my 97 chevy pickup, and was delivered promptly" i have purchased parts at least twice from auto parts warehouse. this one went very well. the part was exactly right for my 97 chevy pickup, and was delivered promptly. i think the price was right, although i did not look too hard for better prices. join our growing community & get facebook deals! follow us on: get
