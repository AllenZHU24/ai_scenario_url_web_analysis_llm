please refer to our cancellation policy for a detailed explanation of how to cancel your order. what happens to my order invoice if the item purchased is not available? at auto parts warehouse, we go to great lengths to make sure that every product we offer on our site is in stock. however, in order to offer the widest selection of parts at times we utilize drop ship partners to augment our own inventory stocks. we run numerous data feeds and checks to ensure these parts are in stock, but from time to time the vendor simply does not have the part we thought they had. when this occurs, we often check with a number of other vendors to see if your part is in stock (which at times can delay the order.) after we have exhausted all means possible in trying to locate the part you ordered, we will issue a refund and notify you via email. the refund process starts as soon as the problem is determined and will take 2-7 days for the amount to be credited back to your account. return to top cancellation policy only orders that have not been confirmed for payment can be cancelled. cancelling an order should be done before receipt of the invoice-payment voucher (sent via email). any orders placed from friday after 5pm est-monday 9am est cannot be cancelled. return to top payment and billing what methods of payment do you accept? the fastest methods to process your order include all major credits card: visa, mastercard, american express and discovery or through paypal, bill-me-later and google checkout. do you accept check, money order, or wire transfer as payment options? yes, auto parts warehouse accepts check, money order, and wire transfer (or electronic debit) as payment options. although using these methods of payment can delay the processing of your order. how do i use paypal, google checkout, and bill me later? on the e-checkout page, you will see the buttons or checkboxes for paypal, google checkout and bill me later. click on or check one of them, and you will be prompted to sign into your account. if you dont have an existing account for any of these payment processors, you will have to register with these services before completing the checkout process. i tried checking out with bill me later but my credit request was denied. why? what are the pre-approval requirements? if your credit request is denied, it is possible that the purchase you are trying to make is greater than your current available credit. if the purchase is within your credit limit, there may be a problem with your credit record. please refer to bill me later credit section for more information, or check out bill me laters account agreement and website. during the checkout process, i noticed "phone number" was a required field. why do you need my phone number? we collect your phone number as well as other contact details so we can inform you if there is a problem with your account or purchase. we may also contact you in case we need to verify or clarify information you provided us. auto parts warehouse may engage with other companies for certain transactions, but we will not share your contact details or other personally identifiable information unless necessary and with your permission. for more information, please read our privacy policy. why are you charging me tax on my order? i live in virginia, kansas or tennessee and auto parts warehouse is based in california. why are you charging me local sales tax on an out-of-state order? if an online retailer has a physical presence in a particular state, such as business offices or a distribution warehouse, it must collect sales tax from customers in that state. if a business does not have a physical presence in a state, it is not required to collect sales tax for sales from customers in that state. because auto parts warehouse has facilities located in virginia, california, kansas, and tennessee, all purchases made from those states will be charged their respective sales taxes. purchases from all other states will not be subject to sales tax. however, consumers who live in a state that collects sales tax are technically required to pay the tax to the state even when an internet retailer doesn't collect it. when consumers are required to pay tax directly to the state, it is referred to as "use" tax rather than sales tax. how do you compute the sales tax on my order/invoice? sales tax on your orders is based on your state and districts rates. why do i need to send over a copy of my billing statement, valid id and a photocopy of the credit card used? we need to verify the billing address and credit card owner for orders that have a delivery address that is different from its billing. this is required for large orders or any international credit cards not using our freight forwarding partner bongo international. return to top shipping and delivery why do body parts take 10-14 business days to ship while others can be expedited? some couriers like fedex and ups dont ship big and bulky items overnight or two-day. and if they ship them by ground, the price is too high and we dont want to charge our customers with over-priced shipping. that is why our company made an arrangement with ags who charges a very reasonable price for shipping. since we use ags, the part can only be shipped by ground and usually takes 10  14 business days for delivery. what shipping companies do you use? most orders are shipped using federal express, ups, ags. engines are shipped using r&l trucking. there are also rare instances when one of our distribution partners may utilize other carriers. what are my shipping options? autopartswarehouse.com uses designated carriers and customers are not able to change that carrier. however, customers can expedite their shipping for select products. please refer to the part detail to see if expedited shipping is available. how long will it take for me to receive my order? the standard ground shipping is 2 to 7 business days. for bulk parts it can take 10 to 14 business days. business days do not include saturday, sunday, or national holidays. for bulk parts it can take 10 to 14 business days. for parts that can be shipped overnight, all orders must be received before 1:00 pm eastern time (10:00 am pacific time) monday through friday in order to be delivered to you on the next business day. for 2-day air delivery, upon completion of the order, granting it made the cut-off, it will get to you on the second business day. overnight and two-day shipping methods are not available for performance part orders. delivery issues i ordered multiple parts and received only some of them! what happened to the rest of the parts? we try very hard to ship your order as soon as possible, and we exhaust all means possible to get them from the closest warehouses. however, in the event multiple parts were ordered, there may be cases where we have to ship the parts from multiple locations. orders that we confirm to have available are shipped right away. the idea is to not make you wait. how come the tracking number that i received on my e-mail shows no movement on the carriers site? usually it takes 24 hours for the carrier to update the tracking information after your part was shipped. however, if it has been longer than 24 hours, there is a possibility that the carrier can't find your exact location. please contact us to verify the shipping address that we have on file. this way, we will be able to communicate detailed information to the carrier. why is my weight cost more than the actual weight of the product? shipping and handling charges are calculated based on dimensional weight; which takes into consideration the total weight, the actual dimension of the shipping box, and the destination. one of my parts was not in stock. how come i did not receive a refund for the shipping? we make every effort to ship all products in a single shipment. if, for any reason, we cannot ship one or more items, we will ship the parts that are available and credit your account accordingly. if a small item (e.g. corner lights, mirrors etc.) from a large order (e.g. orders with hoods, bumpers or whole front end kits) cannot be shipped, credit may only be for the part without an adjustment in shipping and you will be charged the required shipping costs. this is because shipping charges are based on the dimensions of the box. if i choose overnight delivery, will my package arrive the next day? if you choose overnight delivery, the arrival time of your package depends on the airfreight carrier. the airfreight carrier may extend its delivery time by a day for residential deliveries. we are not liable in such cases, and airfreight charges will not be refunded. also, there are no overnight or two-day deliveries on saturdays, sundays, or holidays. if you place your order for overnight or two-day delivery on a weekend or a holiday, be aware that the shipping cycle for these orders starts on the next available business day. all orders must be received before 1:00 pm eastern time (10:00 am pacific time) monday through friday. overnight and two-day shipping methods are not available for performance part orders. why dont you ship for free to alaska and hawaii regardless of my total order cost? free shipping does not apply to alaska and hawaii due to their locations which are separate from the contiguous united states. for more information on our shipping policies, please visit http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/policy.html#shipping do you ship outside the united states? do you ship to us territories, apo/fpo, p.o. boxes, etc ? we ship to other areas outside the continental united states such as alaska and hawaii. however, shipping charges apply, and delivery time will take longer. we do not ship directly to puerto rico and to apos, fpos, and p.o. boxes. for shipping to guam and other international destinations, you can use freight forward services such as bongo international. please visit our international orders section for more information. can you ship direct to locations outside of the united states? please refer to our international orders section. return to top returns, cores and refunds request a return form http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/myaccount/rma will the parts i purchase from your site fit my modified/customized car? can i return the part for credit if it turns out the item doesnt fit? as long as you return a part within 30 days and without any damage or without any missing components, then you will be eligible for a credit on your return (restocking fees may apply). please note that there are items that cannot be returned for any reason. these include repair manuals, cd-roms, custom made products or anything that allows you to download a program to the vehicle. however, repair manuals and cd-roms may be returned if they are unopened and remain sealed. electrical parts cannot be returned as well if they have been unsealed or plugged in. what is a return merchant authorization (rma) number? what can i use this number with? if i return a part, how soon can i expect my refund? a return merchant authorization number, or rma number, is assigned to your return and used for tracking purposes. you can obtain an rma number by completing the required form for any parts you would like to return. within two to three business days, the rma number(s) will be emailed along with instructions on how to return your item. you can expect your refund within 30 days after we receive your return request. the time varies depending on how long the manufacturer takes to approve the return. upon approval, we will then credit the refund to the credit card you used for the purchase and you will receive a credit approved email. please note that the bank may take a few days to process the credit. for apw tire rack returns, separate return authorization forms for tires and wheels and wheels only are available together with special packing instructions. apart from the different forms used, the processing period for returning tires and wheels is roughly the same as that of regular apw return requests. core deposit i want to purchase a part on your site and noticed that there is a core deposit price listed together with the item price. what is a core deposit and why am i being charged for this? there are certain types of auto parts such as alternators, starters, air conditioning compressors, and brake master cylinders that can be reconditioned, recycled, or remanufactured to oem standards for future sale and use. the components of the part that can be remanufactured have a core deposit which is then refunded when buyers return their old part. in short, the core is your old part. send us your old part and the core deposit will be refunded to you upon receipt. detailed instructions will come with your order. note: core return shipping charges are the full responsibility of the customer, and are not refundable. how do i return a core part? core part return instructions: 1) fill out a return request form. 2) we will email you a return merchant authorization number (rma) within 2-3 days to track your return request. 3) remove any items from the part that are needed for proper installation of the replacement part. any parts not included in the replacement package but still attached to the core return will not be returned. 4) drain any fluid from the part, if necessary. 5) to avoid any leakage during shipping, seal the part in a properly secured plastic bag. 6) put bagged part in the manufacturer's box and include a copy of your invoice in the package. 7) secure the boxed part with adequate packing material to assure that it arrives undamaged. 8) return within 30 days after receipt of the replacement part. core part returns must meet the following requirements to be eligible for refund: part(s) must be returned with the return merchant authorization number (rma) and a copy of the of the original invoice/packing slip. must be received within 30 days of the original invoice date. should be fully assembled, complete and in rebuildable condition based on manufacturer's standards. disassembled parts will not be accepted for refund. returned part must be for the vehicle the replacement part was purchased for. to be eligible for a core deposit refund, the returned part must meet the manufacturers requirements. the following conditions may cause a part to be rejected by the manufacturer: - broken or dented parts - stripped threads or ports - mounts or housings thats damaged, cracked, or unusable - extensive rust or corrosion - missing, unoriginal, or disassembled parts how soon will i get my core deposit refunded? upon clearance by the manufacturer, auto parts warehouse will refund the core deposit. refunds are usually processed within 30 days after receipt by auto parts warehouse. customer will be notified in the event of a refused or reduced credit. what if i dont have a part to return? if you do not have a part available to return within 30 days of the original purchase date, the core deposit charge will not be refunded. i could not click on print selected labels button from the fedex site. how do i then print out the shipping label that you sent me? normally, this occurs if you have clicked on the go back button of your browser. to reprint the shipping label: 1.) check the dialog box below the select all none options. 2.) click on the print selected labels tab again. 3.) print shipping label page. why do you need the vehicle identification number (vin) of my vehicle to return the part? we dont need it all the time. if you had a problem getting the correct part, our goal is to make sure that this problem does not happen when other customers order the same part you did. we use the vin of the vehicle just to verify with the manufacturer what went wrong with the part since it does not fit your vehicle. this is done so we can prevent this from happening again. for information about vin and how to locate your vehicles vin, please refer to the what the vehicle identification number (vin) can tell you about your car section. returns  receiving your rma number why did i receive multiple rma numbers? you may have received multiple rma numbers for a variety of reasons. the two most common reasons are: 1.) the part may have been shipped out from a different warehouse and needed to be returned to those specific warehouses for processing. 2.) you may have made separate return requests (at different times.) i requested a return merchandise authorization (rma) number and i was informed that i would receive an e-mail within 24-48 hours with the rma number and instructions. its been longer than 2 days and i have not received the rma. we automatically send you the rma within 24  48 hours if the part(s) come from one of our own warehouses. however, if an outside distributor was used, that partner may not be able to respond within 24  48 hours. if for some reason you have not received the rma number and instructions by the third day, please contact customer service at 1-800-913-6119 or 1-801-214-2997 (then press 3) or customerservice@autopartswarehouse.com so we can help expedite the rma process with our partner. how long will it take before i receive my return credit? we normally determine the timeframe once we receive the part(s) back and have inspected it to determine if it is in the condition described when the rma was requested. it should take only 2 to 7 business days for the amount to get credited back to your account from the day it was confirmed delivered back to the warehouse. for return shipments that you paid for, it will help us process the credit faster if you could provide us the return tracking number once it has shipped out. i returned everything that i ordered from you at the same time, why did i receive a refund for only one part? there are multiple reasons why you may not have received your full refund yet. the three most common are: 1.) if you received more than one set of rma email instructions, it is important you use each of these separately with the corresponding part(s.) if you failed to do so and sent all of the parts together, it can delay the processing as parts may need to be returned to separate warehouses. 2.) a part may appear damaged. part of your order may be approved, while further investigation is being done on the remaining part(s.) 3.) parts are processed separately. credits are issued by part and not by order so as we clear each part, a credit is issued. are there limitations to items that can be returned and refunded? there are items that cannot be returned for any reason. these include repair manuals, cd-roms, custom made products or anything that allows you to download a program to the vehicle. however, repair manuals and cd-roms may be returned if they are unopened and remain sealed. electrical parts cannot be returned as well if they have been unsealed or plugged in. please read our return procedure for more information on returns and refunds. why am i being charged a restocking fee on my returned part? how do you calculate the restocking charges? restocking fees are charged for any items returned that are not the result of error on our part. we go to great lengths to assure that the item we ship is undamaged and functional. restocking fees are generally used to deal with the costs incurred with your return. restocking fees are 20% of the actual product price and the customer is responsible for the return shipping charges. tires and wheels are excluded from the restocking fees. return to top international orders can you ship direct to any other countries beyond the united states and canada? no, we do not ship directly to any other countries outside of the united states and canada. customers are welcome to use a freight forwarder in the united states. although, keep in mind, using an international credit card will require you to go through additional credit checks and verification procedures. bongo international why do i need to use bongo? why cant the parts just be shipped directly to me? providing our broad selection of high quality low cost parts should be available to all of the visitors of our website. unfortunately high fraud levels have prohibited us from shipping our parts outside of the united states in the past. bongo provides a comprehensive fraud screening process that allows us to comfortably ship internationally. additionally, we stock many of the parts in our own warehouses. however, unlike most e-commerce products, not only do we offer over half a million different products (hoods, bumpers, alloy wheels, spark plugs, etc.) but there are dozens of different vehicle combinations (ford, chevy, bmw, etc.) for each part type. when you multiply out the different parts by the different vehicle combinations, it comes to tens of millions of different part types. no warehouse or warehouses can stock each and every one! as a result, in order to offer the widest selection of parts we sometimes use manufacturer drop ship partners to augment our current stock of products. due to logistical challenges and complexities associated with international shipping, many of these vendors are unable to ship directly to your country and there would still be a need for a facility to consolidate all of the parts (when multiple parts are ordered from different warehouses and drop ship partners) in order to provide you the lowest shipping cost to your desired country. where should i put my bongo address in the checkout page? we recommend using your bongo address for your billing and shipping information. please fill in 955 connecticut avenue in address line 1, and your bongo suite number (i.e. suite 21002) in address line 2. are the shipping charges i see on my bill my total cost? no! the shipping charges are the charges related to shipping to your bongo address in the united states. there are additional shipping charges once the part reaches your bongo address to your desired destination. you are also responsible for any customs and duties associated with the part being allowed into your country. but to help you estimate what the shipping charges to your country will be once the part reaches bongo, we strongly encourage you to download the bongo buddy. your website says free shipping, why do i have to pay bongo shipping charges? the free shipping relates to shipping to your bongo address in the united states. there are additional shipping charges once the part reaches your bongo address to your desired destination. you are also responsible for any customs and duties associated with the part being allowed into your country. but to help you estimate what the shipping charges to your country will be once the part reaches bongo, we strongly encourage you to download the bongo buddy. why cant i use a different credit card to sign up for bongo than to purchase on the website? in order to verify and process the order, we ask that customers use the same credit card that they used to purchase their auto part(s) from us to sign up for bongo. we apologize for the inconvenience. however, international shipping involves a higher fraud risk for us. and individuals have tried to use a valid credit card to get cleared at bongo, and then used a fraudulent card to purchase from us. we wish we lived in a fraud free world where valued customers such as yourself did not have to go through this added inconvenience. but without such a check in place, we simply would not be able to ship internationally at all. how long will it take for my part to reach bongo? we have worked very hard with bongo to expedite the process and sometimes it can be as quick as 24 hours. however, shipping times will vary depending on the size of the package and the delivery location. small and medium sized packages generally are delivered within 2 - 7 business days (excluding weekends and holidays) from their date of shipment to your u.s. address. orders containing bumpers, fenders, doors, hoods, grille guards, nerf bars, or other large parts require special handling and are usually shipped via truck freight. the delivery times usually range from 2 - 14 business days. what will happen once the part(s) reaches bongo? the following process will take place when all of your items have arrived at the bongo facility. when ordering multiple parts, some orders may be shipped from multiple locations. please confirm with bongo that all of your parts have arrived before having the parts shipped to your country. pay per use customers - once item(s) from your order are received at bongo they will ship your product(s) to your destination. shipping charges are billed at the actual weight or dimensional weight of the shipment, whichever is greater. you will need to log into your bongo account to process the shipment. subscription customers - bongo will receive your goods and send you an email advising what items have arrived. the items will be updated into the online system where you will be required to process the order for delivery to your country. click below to understand the billing process with bongo international. http://bongous.com/mail_forwarding_faq.php i didnt realize shipping this part from bongo would cost me this much! i dont want the part anymore, what should i do? to help you estimate what the shipping charges to your country will be once the part reaches bongo, we strongly encourage you to download the bongo buddy in order to avoid potential sticker shock. keep in mind, shipping internationally is more costly. but if you have already ordered the part and it has arrived at bongo and still do not wish to have the part shipped to your country, you will need to submit a return request through our website as well as through your bongo account. please visit the returns section of our website for more information. there was a problem with the part(s) i received. please visit the returns section of our website for more information. return to top join our growing community & get facebook deals! follow @apwcares get email exclusives! sign up to receive discounts and promotions about about us autopartswarehouse reviews affiliate program help center live chat contact us returns auto repair help find parts that fit how to shop see all your account login/register your account track order retrieve quote cart let's talk call 1.800.913.6027 our 24/7 toll-free phone support with one of our auto parts experts 801-214-2997 is our alternative number how do you like our website tell us your feedback » we accept read all autopartswarehouse reviews » replacement parts | performance parts | custom parts | models | sitemap copyright © 2000-2011 autopartswarehouse. all rights reserved. close × select your vehicle for compatible products, please select your vehicle year, make and model. to ensure a perfect fit, some parts may require submodel and engine type information too. select year... select make... select model... select submodel... select engine type... close you came from an apw affiliate site! close
