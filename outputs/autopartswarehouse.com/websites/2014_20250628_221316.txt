the answer is simple--it wouldn't even have automotive equipment to sell and a name to begin with. robert bosch, then a 25-year old electrician, created a magneto ignition device for a stationary engine that later became the company's key product, which launched its century-long career.camille jenatzybosch's history isn't just made up of people who invent spark plugs and tweak cars. there are also those people who drive their way into the company's history. one of the earliest to do this was camille jenatzy. jenatzy was a belgian race car driver nicknamed le diable rouge ("the red devil"). he was also one of bosch's go-to advertisers, with cartoonish posters littered with his red beard. but aside from representing bosch in print, jenatzy also helped established the brand's reputation in the circuit by winning the 1903 gordon bennett race in ireland in a bosch ignition system-equipped mercedes.frederick simms and arnold zähringer the bosch company is often associated with continuous automotive innovation. but in its earlier years, the company found itself stuck in a rut. in1897, after installing magneto ignition devices on vehicle engines, english engineer frederick simms came to him with a proposition--install a magneto ignition device in a de dion-bouton three-wheeler. but with the more powerful, high-speed engine of the three-wheeler, the device was no longer a suitable upgrade. it was arnold zähringer, bosch's factory manager that solved the then-small-supplier's problem. he fitted a weight metal sleeve and laid it around the armature on the engine to increase the ignition's sparks per minute. bosch products have you been driving your car for many years now?
