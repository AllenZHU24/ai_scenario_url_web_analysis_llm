bodycandy body jewelry blog dec 03 the beauty of the septum piercing by jodie · comments (0) septum piercings became popular in 2014, and are still on the rise in 2015. the goddess-like quality implied by the piercing itself is testament enough to its beauty, but that’s not all. septum clickers, the most popular type of jewelry worn in a septum piercing, are beautifully unique pieces of jewelry. often adorned with glimmering gemstones, these rings “click” into place inside the nostril, leaving only the delicate design of the ring to see. other jewelry commonly worn in a septum piercing: captive bead rings and horseshoe circular barbells. check out some of our best selling favorites this holiday season: categories : alternative and gothic fashion now, jewelry fashion, modification culture, septum jewelry, steal the style comments (0) nov 27 bodycandy holiday gift guide by jodie · comments (0) not sure what to get for that hard to shop for person on your list this holiday? undecided on what direction to go in? shop the bodycandy gift guide for our top picks for the modified beauties in your life!

james starts by cleaning the area where gabby’s piercings will go. he then marks the locations for each dermal and measures to make sure they’re lined up on either side. a hollow piercing needle is used to remove the small section of skin where the anchor will be placed. james then inserts the dermal anchor. during healing, the skin grows around the anchor, holding the piercing in place. james then repeats the process on the other side. since the piercings are so close together, gabby must return for a second visit to complete the project. 6 weeks later, james pierces her second set, and her dermal anchor project is complete. healing time: 2-3 months initial jewelry: dermal anchor, with interchangeable tops that can be switched out after fully healed. categories : body jewelry information, body piercing interviews, coolest piercings you may have never heard of, crash course, pick of the day, piercing and aftercare information, piercisms, surface piercings comments (0) nov 16 new plugs in stock!
