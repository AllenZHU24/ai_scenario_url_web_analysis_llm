be a tough one. <em>will it look good on me? how bad is it going to hurt? what if it doesn&#8217;t heal?</em> these are all questions that can detour someone from going through with a piercing.</p> <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-16502" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fear.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="221" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-16504" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/newblog11.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="221" /></p> <p>let&#8217;s clear a few of those up!</p> <p><strong>will it look good on me?</strong><br /> we all know beauty is not only skin deep, but maybe you&#8217;re unsure if a certain piercing is fit for your body. negative body image can greatly effect your decision and lead you to believe there are physical reasons your piercing won&#8217;t work out. well, we&#8217;re here to tell you that if you take care of your body, that&#8217;s not true! consult with your doctor to be certain of any health related issues that might complicate the piercing or healing process, or just ask your piercer. a professional will never pierce you if they feel it&#8217;s unsafe. and no need to feel self-conscious around these artists. a good piercer is compassionate about their work. after all, your body is their canvas.</p> <p><strong>how bad is it going to hurt?<br /> </strong>you can&#8217;t always trust the opinion of a friend. as a teenager, i went into my navel piercing thinking i wouldn&#8217;t feel a thing, because that&#8217;s what my girl friends told me. every body has a different tolerance for pain. as a general rule of thumb:</p> <ul> <li>earlobe, navel, tongue and eyebrow piercings are the least painful.</li> <li>septum, labret, dermal (surface) piercings, cartilage piercings, nostril and male intimate piercings are typically a medium level of pain for most.</li> <li>the most painful piercings are in sensitive areas, ie. nipple and intimate piercings.</li> </ul> <p><strong>what if it doesn&#8217;t heal?<br /> </strong>everybody knows somebody who&#8217;s had a piercing that didn&#8217;t heal properly or rejected. an easy way to avoid either of those from happening is to make certain you&#8217;re being pierced by a reputable artist. doing it yourself or with the help of a friend is never a good idea.<br /> to ensure your professional piercing does heal properly it is advisable not to get pierced when you are sick, physically exhausted, or stressed. if you are on medications of any sort, reschedule your piercing appointment &#8211; it&#8217;s for your own safety. if you have sensitive skin and scar or bruise easily, the chances of a smooth healing process are lower. any open wounds or piercings that are not fully healed yet can effect the healing process of a new piercing. upcoming medical procedures should be taken into consideration, also, since removing body jewelry is often a requirement. removing a piercing before the recommended healing time can cause serious infection.<br /> as long as you follow proper piercing care instructions, your piercing will heal!</p> <p>to be sure you are receiving a

detour people from wearing jewelry, and who wants that?!</p> <p>when it comes to body piercing, it is especially important to know what your body reacts to. an allergic reaction can be as simple as a rash or itching, or as severe as blistering. because your skin is ever changing throughout your life, it is possible you may develop a sensitivity at any time. even if you&#8217;re uncertain and just want to play it safe, the following materials should keep you in the clear.</p> <p><a title="bioplast body jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/bioplast/" target="_blank">bioplast </a>contains no metal whatsoever! it can be heat sterilized and is safe for healing swollen or infected piercings. when it comes to hypoallergenic materials, this is your savior.</p> <p><a class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16475" title="bioplast" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/bioplast/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16475" title="bioplast" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bioplast.jpg" alt="bioplast body jewelry" width="585" height="300" /></a></p> <p><a title="solid titanium body jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=grade+titanium" target="_blank">solid titanium pieces with a grade 23 or 5</a> are safe for those with jewelry allergies. steer clear of anodized titanium, however, because these pieces are only plated with titanium, and will have a center made of other metals. like bioplast, titanium can be heat sterilized, and is therefore safe for initial piercings.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=grade+titanium"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16480" title="titanium" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/titanium1.jpg" alt="titanium body jewelry" width="585" height="250" /></a></p> <p><a title="platinum body jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=platinum" target="_blank">platinum jewelry</a> is also excellent for piercings, however the material itself is rare and therefore comes with a higher price tag. if your sensitivity is mild, some <a title="stainless steel body jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/inpi/316l-basic-collection.html" target="_blank">stainless steel</a> &amp; <a title="solid 14kt and 18kt gold body jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/solid14ktgold" target="_blank">14k-18k gold pieces</a> may also be an option.</p> <p>when in doubt, stick with titanium and bioplast!</p> http://blog.bodycandy.com/2015/01/13/quick-take-body-jewelry-for-sensitive-skin/feed/ 1 nose ring sizing q and a: why

href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/noserings/nose-rings.html" target="_blank">nose piercings</a> will jump around a bit, try a few different styles, and ultimately pick one or two go-to nose rings that fit well without very much difficulty.  but what happens when you find a bunch of nose rings you like, and most of them just plain don&#8217;t fit?</p> <p>if you know your gauge size and the style you prefer but still find your nose jewelry sticking up or sticking out, it&#8217;s time to get down to the nitty gritty.  not every nose will be the very same size and not <a title="basic jewelry for every piercing" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/inpi/316l-basic-collection.html" target="_blank">every piercing</a> will rest in the same place.  so here&#8217;s a few common nose jewelry pitfalls, and trust us, most of them <em>can</em> be fixed.</p> <p>q: instead of laying flat against my nose, why does my nose ring stick up leaving a gap?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.bodycandy.com/2015/01/06/nose-ring-sizing-q-and-a-why-doesnt-my-nose-ring-fit/nose-sticks-up/" rel="attachment wp-att-16457" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16457" style="border: 0px none;" title="nose ring sticks up" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nose-sticks-up.jpg" alt="nose rit fit issues" width="500" height="193" /></a></p> <p>a: if the actual gem or decorative portion that&#8217;s visible sticks up, you need to look at the rise of your jewelry.  rise is the length of the portion between the base of your<a title="stunning gem nose rings" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/noseringgem" target="_blank"> nose ring&#8217;s gem</a> and the curve, and many common nose screws or l-shapes have a rise of 6 or 7 millimeters.  for those with slightly thinner nostrils though, a 5mm rise might be needed for proper fit, so you should look for an item with that smaller measurement.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.bodycandy.com/2015/01/06/nose-ring-sizing-q-and-a-why-doesnt-my-nose-ring-fit/nose-ring-rise/" rel="attachment

src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nose-ring-rise.jpg" alt="nose jewelry length or rise measurement" width="585" height="350" /></a></p> <p>q: why does the corkscrew part of my nose screw stick out at the bottom of my nostril?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.bodycandy.com/2015/01/06/nose-ring-sizing-q-and-a-why-doesnt-my-nose-ring-fit/nose-sticks-out/" rel="attachment wp-att-16461" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full

height="193" /></a></p> <p>a: if this happens it could mean you either have a slightly smaller nose than average, or that your piercing lays just slightly farther down your nostril.  neither of these are a bad thing, but they can make wearing screw style jewelry a little difficult.  if switching to a <a title="nose bone jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=nose+bone" target="_blank">nose bone style</a> item is comfortable, that can be a quick and easy fix.  for those who would prefer to stick to screws though, trying an item with a less pronounced curve or one that doesn&#8217;t make a full revolution may solve the issue.</p> <p>q: i want to wear a<a title="hoop nose jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/nosehoops" target="_blank"> nose hoop</a> but my piercing is a little higher on my nostril.  how can i get a hoop that will fit without looking oversized?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.bodycandy.com/2015/01/06/nose-ring-sizing-q-and-a-why-doesnt-my-nose-ring-fit/nose-no-hoop/" rel="attachment wp-att-16462" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16462" style="border: 0px none;" title="nose hoop fit" src="http://blog.bodycandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nose-no-hoop.jpg" alt="nose hoop jewelry sizing" width="500" height="193" /></a></p> <p>a: if regular hoops don&#8217;t seem to be quite big enough but larger universal circulars stick out too much, a good fix is getting a custom bend.  in this case, you can purchase a type of extra long, straight nose ring called <a title="fishtail style sraight nose rings" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/search/go?view=grid&amp;w=fishtail+straight+nose+ring" target="_blank">a fishtail,</a> and take it to your piercer to get a hoop custom bent for your unique nose.</p>

<p>now before you go getting bummed about this seemingly anti-climactic season opener, allow us to clarify exactly what <em>marsala</em> really is.  whereas wine, or <a title="beautiful dark red jewelry" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=ruby+red" target="_blank">deep red</a> with a hint of violet, may be a color about as old as time itself, marsala is a far more brilliant offshoot.  in the purest (and certainly intended) form, we&#8217;re talking about a rich, dimensional, rusty red that hearkens to the era of film noir.  a color that&#8217;s capable of bringing out every woman&#8217;s inner femme fatale, and transforming your average about-town joe into a dashing gentleman of leisure.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a

href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=coral" target="_blank">coral</a>, and rich warm browns like bronze, coconut, and amber.  it even lends depth when combined with desaturated pastels such as lilac heather, dusty rose, and <a title="soft neutral yellow" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=search&amp;query=cream+pearl" target="_blank">lemon gray</a>.</p> <p>is it the color that is a mystery wrapped in an enigma?  <em>now</em> your getting it!  just think of what a little <a title="red and colored jewelry candles" href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/ring-candle-jewelry-candles" target="_blank">strategic red</a> can do.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a

style="color: #888888;">last note:  for anyone who doesn&#8217;t partake of such libations, you&#8217;ll be intrigued to know that the new signature shade gets its name from (perhaps you guessed) marsala wine, a distinct, sweet table red that originally hails from southern italy.</span></p> http://blog.bodycandy.com/2014/12/23/seeing-red-pantone-2015-color-of-the-year/feed/ 0
