pc in the news (+) behind the scenes careers what our customers say affiliate agreement press inquiries stores fiber care general care and storage instructions before you begin, read the care label attached to the garment and any hangtags or care instructions included in garment packaging. handwashing when hand washing is advised, we recommend the following method: gently hand wash in cool water (up to 85°f) with a mild soap. we recommend using luxury fibre wash, our natural, non-toxic formula that maintains the garment’s natural lanolin and oils. do not use the hand wash cycle in a washing machine. never use chlorine bleach. gently press to remove excess water. do not wring or twist; handle gently to avoid wrinkles and distortion. dry flat (lay horizontally for drying). block to dry (reshape to original dimensions while drying). smooth by hand while wet to remove wrinkles and straighten the seams and facings. dry cleaning when dry cleaning is advised, we recommend the following: seek out a reputable cleaner that is a member of the international fabricare institute. bring with you any labels or hangtags that contain fiber information or care instructions. outfits with several pieces should be cleaned at the same time to avoid any color discrepancies resulting from cleaning. inform the cleaner of any spots or stains; they will want to treat some stains before the dry cleaning process. your cleaner may also provide mothproofing. request this service, if needed. machine washing when machine washing is advised, we recommend the following method: machine wash in cool water (up to 85°f) with a mild soap on delicate cycle. never use chlorine bleach. hang to dry or dry flat (lay horizontally for drying). suede & leather care dry clean only using a professional cleaner specializing in suede and leather cleaning. do not use cleaning fluids or abrasives. suede should be regularly brushed with a suede brush or dry sponge to keep it clean and remove excess fibers. the loose fibers of a new suede garment have a tendency to “crock” initially—i.e. they form a fine dust which rubs off on clothing. if you wear your garment in the rain, be advised that it may become permanently affected by water spots. storage store handknit and hand-loomed sweaters flat. as a general precaution, we do not advise hanging knit garments. to avoid moth damage, take normal mothproofing precautions. when storing suede or leather garments, hang in a well-ventilated area. suede or leather garments need to breathe so should not be stored in a plastic bag. sign up for email
