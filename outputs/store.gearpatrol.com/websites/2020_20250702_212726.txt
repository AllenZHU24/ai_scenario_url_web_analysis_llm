reasonable efforts to safeguard your information. email marketing and opting out with your consent, as noted above, we will use your e-mail address and/or other personal information to provide you

have a relationship with a gear patrol employee and you no longer want to receive messages, you must expressly request that person stop sending you messages. if you have revoked your consent to receiving commercial messages, but you have not opted out of targeting cookies in your settings in your browser, revoking your consent will not stop you from seeing ads on third party websites based upon your browsing history on the gear patrol websites. links our website may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. those sites may have their own privacy policies or
