bookbyte is happy to buy back textbooks you no longer need. enter the isbn or title of the textbook you want to sell in the “sell” search bar. you’ll see a copy of the textbook and how much we’re offering for it. if you're happy with the price, click “continue sale” and complete the process. we’ll then give you a shipping label to print out (we pay for shipping so you don’t have to) and you send us the textbook. in 4-14 days we receive it, and you get paid via check or paypal, your choice. advantages of selling textbooks early it’s no secret that you want to sell your textbook before it gets replaced by a newer edition. selling early means you’ll get more money, and you’ll get cash for your textbook when you sell it to bookbyte. and since you want the most cash for your textbook buyback, you want to sell asap. we know how much can change between semesters, so we offer you a protected quote on your textbooks. once we give you a quote on a textbook, it’s protected for 30 days, even if the value of that textbook goes down. that way, you never get blindsided by a new edition being released after you decide to sell your textbooks. will you accept my book in its condition? the book must be in resalable condition in order for us to accept it. regardless of whether the textbook you are selling is in new or used condition, we offer the same quote. resalable (like new, good used, and acceptable conditions) books with minor to no signs of wear and tear. this can include staining, discoloration, writing, highlighting, markings, tears, and other general damage from use. all pages must be included and all text legible. bookbyte pays the same amount for used and unused books in like new–acceptable condition.you will receive the quoted amount. non-resalable books that have excessive writing, highlighting, or other markings on over 75% of the pages; cover damage greater than a 2"x2" section; numerous torn pages; excessive odor; mold; obscured text or illegible text; or severe staining covering more than a 1/3 of the page and spanning more than 1/3 of the book; missing pages or stuck-together pages; or books that are deemed inauthentic or a replica.non-resalable books will be recycled and no payment will be sent. where do i find the isbn? check the title page of your book. the isbn will be the 10- or 13-digit number you see there. the isbn can also sometimes be found above the bar code on the back cover, but we recommend double-checking the title page to make sure you are entering the correct isbn. if you are trying to sell an international edition, look carefully! these editions will often have two isbns printed on them: one for the normal student version and one for the alternate. please note: we do not accept instructor edition textbooks of any kind. be sure to pay close attention to the title and description of the item in your cart when selling, to make sure it matches up with the edition of the textbook you are selling. recent textbook buyback offers our customers love us quick help order status return rental shipping rates buyback policy information company policies cheap textbooks bookbyte blog useful links affiliate program help center sitemap subscribe to our newsletter sign up stay connected with us: contact us help center  /  the fastest way to get help! email  /  send your questions to help@bookbyte.com twitter  /  @bookbytehelp for order status updates 8:30 am-5:00 pm pst monday–friday we're hiring! © 1999-2019 bookbyte. privacy | terms of use
