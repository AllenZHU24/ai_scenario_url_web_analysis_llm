here’s how. strategy 1 - how to overcome the supply and demand problem it is a truth universally acknowledged that a student in possession of a textbook must have overpaid for it. that is, if you live in the united states. students don’t actually control demand in the united states, so textbook prices can rise and rise without any consequences for the publisher. fortunately, there are a few ways students can get around the supply and demand problem they’re faced with. >> here we examine the issue of overpriced textbooks, its causes, and explore different ways students can tackle the abusive/exploitative practices they face from the textbook industry. strategy 2 - buy international edition textbooks: same book, a different cover international edition textbooks are priced for the rest of the world (which means reasonably). however, there's a lot of mystery surrounding international textbooks and the different places they come from around the world. are the global edition and the eastern economy edition the same, or is one better than the other? is it even legal to buy international editions in the us? (hint: yes it is) >> here we examine the legality of buying international edition textbooks, the different naming conventions for international editions, their risk factors for buying, and the best ways to find international edition textbooks. strategy 3 - use the previous edition: big savings, small risk textbooks are a lot like used cars: last year's model is cheaper and still drives, but it might not have the bells and whistles of the newest model. often buying the previous edition of a textbook or a spiral bound version will save you a great deal, but you need to make sure the old version has the content you need before you buy. >> here we discuss the pros and cons of buying the previous edition, which fields of study are more likely to benefit from buying older books, and the importance of relying on your professor to save money on textbooks. strategy 4 - buy a used textbook: pay less, and get help taking notes if you're willing to buy a used textbook instead of a new one, you can save a huge amount of money. most places sell everything from brand new to heavily used, but the terminology used to describe book quality can be confusing. >> here we break down the different used textbook descriptions so you know exactly what you’re getting when you choose a used book. we also examine the real reason used textbooks are less expensive, and the false novelty of being the first to own something. quick help order status return rental shipping rates buyback policy information company policies cheap textbooks bookbyte blog useful links affiliate program help center sitemap subscribe to our newsletter sign up stay connected with us: contact us help center  /  the fastest way to get help! email  /  send your questions to help@bookbyte.com twitter  /  @bookbytehelp for order status updates 8:30 am-5:00 pm pst monday–friday we're hiring! © 1999-2019 bookbyte. privacy | terms of use
