information very seriously.  so, we wanted to provide you with some information on our policy for how we collect, process, transmit and store your data and personal information and some of the ways we work to keep that data and personal information private and secure (the “policy”).  please review this policy carefully. just so we are clear about who is who and to keep things simple, boxed's legal name is boxed, llc, but we do business as boxed ( “boxed”).  this policy also covers our subsidiaries and affiliates, which, together with boxed, we refer to in this policy as the “company”, “boxed”, “we”, “our,”, and “us”. boxed provides products, services, content, and other features (the “boxed services”) to you when you use or shop on our mobile applications, boxed.com, boxed social media properties, or our other websites, marketplace pages and blogs, and/or other software and digital properties provided by boxed (the “boxed sites”). the boxed sites are owned and/or operated by boxed. we refer to the users of the boxed sites as “you” and “your”. this policy describes: how we collect, and you may provide, information through our website, including the www.boxed.com domain, our mobile applications and our vendor information portal (collectively, the “sites”); how we use and protect information; with whom we may share information; and the types of information we collect. we published this policy because we want you to be aware of the information we collect and help you make an informed decision about using our sites and services.  by visiting the boxed sites and accessing or using the linked pages, features, content, or any of our other services made available through the boxed sites or otherwise, you acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this policy. if you do not agree to this policy, in whole or in part, you may not access or otherwise use the boxed sites.  this policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through any boxed site. we may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information and data collection, processing, use, disclosure, transfer or storage practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. in the event that any changes to this policy are material, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the newest version of this policy on this page with a link to the text of the previous version of the policy, and, where appropriate, by other means such as one or more of an e-mail communication, homepage banner or pop-up, or other conspicuous notification . your continued use of the boxed sites after notice that the policy has been changed together with the posting of the updated policy, represents your receipt, acknowledgment and agreement of the terms of the then-current version of the policy. california residents and nevada residents: please see section 5 below for notices relevant to you. 1. what information do we collect? information you provide we collect the information you enter on the boxed sites or make available through the boxed sites when you, among other things, access any boxed site, register as a member, create an account, engage in a transaction, search our products, contact us or our customer service department by telephone, email, or otherwise, or participate in events, surveys, questionnaires, contests or other promotions we may sponsor or take part in with partners.  please note that we may collect personally identifiable information (“pii”) from the boxed sites only when you choose to provide it to us, including by accessing, viewing, and browsing any boxed site.  we may use this information to correspond with you and as otherwise permitted by this policy. the information collected through the boxed sites or in direct interactions with you may include: your contact information, such as your name, email address, password, shipping address, usernames and social media handles, and/or telephone numbers; your payment information, such as credit/debit card information, billing addresses, and other billing information; the shipping information of any third parties that you enter when shipping orders to such third parties, including their names, email address, shipping and billing addresses, and telephone numbers; your device identifiers, including ip address, mobile device iccid/sim/imei/esn numbers, and other serial numbers; and your browsing, click and purchase history. certain information, statements, data, and content (such as photographs or videos) which you may submit to us may reveal your gender identity, ethnicity , race, nationality, age, and/or other demographic information about you. we do not knowingly collect sensitive information such as government-issued identifiers, social security numbers, financial account information, insurance plan information or specific information related to your health or medical conditions. from time-to-time, we may use third party widgets, programs and features (“widgets”) on the boxed sites to help provide products and services that we feel might be of use to you.  these widgets may ask you for additional information, such as the referral information (names and email addresses) of people or companies that you may wish to refer to us, pursuant to the privacy policies of such third parties.  of course, it is up to you as to whether you provide any of this type of information. mobile web and ios and android apps we may collect certain additional information from you when you access the sites with mobile devices or with our ios and android mobile apps (the “boxed apps”).  this information may include location, device type, unique device identifier, mobile operating system, site navigation, and other app-specific user data.  when this data is collected, it is analyzed periodically to help us create a more user-friendly, improved shopping experience within the mobile web interface and/or the boxed apps.  you may restrict the collection of certain data, like location, and/or opt out of notifications from the boxed apps by changing the settings preferences on your mobile device and/or through your boxed account management page, including https://www.boxed.com/account/email-preferences. automatically collected information; interest-based advertising. when you interact with the boxed sites, advertisements or other content provided by boxed or third parties, on behalf of boxed, through your computer, phone or mobile device (we’ll refer to these as “devices” throughout the policy), we, and third parties, may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information (“non-pii”) about or from your device, such as, without limitation, your browser information on our server logs including your ip address, browser type, browser versions, browser language, browser plug-in type and version, country and time zone, urls that refer visitors to our sites, dates and times of visits to our sites, page views and site navigation, geographic location, cookie information (see below), web beacons, pixel tags, device fingerprinting or other means, the page you requested, duration of activity on our sites, searches, shopping behavior and preferences, hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, and purchases. we may use this information, and tie it back to the information you provide to us, to tailor or customize your shopping experience and/or interaction with boxed, allowing us to surface various products and special offers in which you may have interest.  this form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any pii. as a result, we and our vendors know your interests, but cannot personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. we believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. however, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “what choices do users have.” we may also aggregate and anonymize this information with similar information from our other customers in order to understand how our customers use the boxed sites, and/or third-party service providers (defined below) may collect non-pii from the boxed sites as well. cookies a cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  we use a variety of cookies, such as session, persistent and analytics cookies, among others, to identify and authenticate visitors and to store information in your electronic shopping baskets so it can be retrieved later. by using the boxed sites, you accept the use of cookies as described in this policy.  you can disable or delete cookies by changing the preferences on your device browser (usually located in the “help” or “tools” menu).  disabling cookies may, however, prevent you from using some of the essential features of the boxed sites. please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on the boxed apps.  however, on many devices, boxed app users may opt out of certain mobile tracking activities via their device settings.  for further information, please see “what choices do users have” below. if you have any questions or need assistance regarding cookies, you can contact us at privacy@boxed.com. we use third-party tracking services that use cookies to provide non-pii and we also use third-party tracking services through the boxed sites.  these tracking services collect information about our users on an aggregate basis and such collected information is analyzed periodically to gain a greater understanding of the usage patterns within the boxed sites. web beacons and pixel tags boxed and our third-party service providers (defined below) may use web beacons or pixel tags to control the automated collection of non-pii.  these small electronic tags on specific web pages on the boxed sites help us monitor the activity on the boxed sites in order to improve the performance of certain features and your shopping experience. javascript in order to collect the kinds of information described in this policy and to see how you interact with the boxed sites, we, or third parties, may use javascript or other languages to send instructions to your devices. do not track some browsers may provide a “do not track” option which signals to websites and web services that you do not wish to have your online activities tracked over time or across different websites.  a “do not track” option may also allow you to opt out of behavioral advertising. at this time, because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “do not track” signals, the boxed sites neither respond to nor support “do not track” requests and will continue to collect information about your online activity as mentioned in this policy notwithstanding our receipt of such signal or request. 2. what we do with collected information we may use the information you provide and/or make accessible to us, directly or indirectly, and information we collect about or that relates to you for various reasons, including to: improve your user experience on the boxed sites, boxed apps and with boxed generally, including to expedite access to your boxed account and boxed services; notify you of any boxed-related promotions, deals and other information that may be of use to you or any deals or promotions from our partners; assist in conducting marketing efforts, including sweepstakes, contexts, marketing campaigns and other promotional activities; create or administer your account and communicate with you about account creation, activity or modification, placed orders and shipping updates.  you can opt out of these emails or other notifications at any time by clicking unsubscribe at the bottom of our emails or by changing your email preferences at https://www.boxed.com/account/email-preferences; notify you about any changes to this policy or the terms and conditions; respond to your requests, submissions, sweepstakes/contest entries and questions; operate, assess, analyze, enhance, and improve our businesses, research, data, marketing and advertising strategies, and our product offerings; perform accounting, auditing, and billing activities; detect, investigate, report and protect against security incidents, data breaches, and fraud; and respond to lawful court orders, subpoenas, warrants, or other requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), comply with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards and enforce our rights , this policy and our terms and conditions and other policies. we may employ third-party service providers and independent contractors (the “third-party service providers”) to help, on behalf of boxed, facilitate our services, features and other offerings by providing, among other things, analytics, results, links, connectors, apis, advertisements, embedded content or other tools and services.  these third-party service providers may collect non-pii through the use of cookies, pixel tags, device fingerprinting or other automated means.  the third-party service providers may use this information internally or share this information with us for various purposes and reasons, including to assist us in providing a more customized shopping experience.  this policy covers on only our use of information we collect. we may use non-pii from third parties (such as data vendors) pursuant to their own privacy policies. similarly, we may enhance the non-pii collected via the boxed sites, boxed apps, and our any devices used to access such sites and/or apps with non-pii collected from or provided by our business partners, including third-party service providers. the boxed sites and certain third-party service providers use a number of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other automated data-fed algorithms (“automated processing”). for example, we use automated processing to, among other things, detect and prevent fraud, detect and prevent information breaches, optimize promotions and other marketing displayed to you, enhance your experience on and interactions with the boxed sites and determine your eligibility for certain products and services (for example, geographically and seasonally specific items fulfilled to specific locations). 3. sharing of information information shared with third-party service providers we may share information we collect with our third-party service providers and other third parties that we engage to help us administer and provide our services and to perform tasks on our behalf (for example, hosting the boxed sites, shipping your orders, customer service, marketing communications, data and performance analytics, and fraud detection) and we share your information with such third parties when it is needed for such purposes. information shared with third parties from time-to-time, we may offer a referral program or referral offers on the boxed sites to our existing users.  if you sign up for an account on the boxed sites or otherwise provide us with information by clicking on a referral link—whether through an email, text message, through a social media site, or other electronic or mobile mechanism—provided to you by an individual who has identified you as one of his or her contacts, and consent to the sharing of your pii, we may share your pii with the individual who has referred you to us.  we may also inform individuals who identify to us that you are one of their contacts whether or not you already have an account on the boxed sites. we may also share aggregated, anonymized, and non-pii with our business partners and/or any other third party (for example, suppliers, vendors, publishers, advertisers or connected sites) for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.  for example, we may share such information to show trends about the general use of our services, the boxed sites and the boxed apps. we may also use your pii, as provided or made available by you through the boxed sites, to contact and correspond with you and/or to respond to your inquiries, requests and/or other submissions. we do not sell your pii to third parties, data brokers or mass marketers for monetary consideration, but please note that we may disclose pii to third parties that provide us with services such as helping us with advertising, data analysis and security, which may fall under the definition of “sale” or “valuable consideration” or other similar defined terms under the california consumer privacy act or the data security and privacy laws of other states.  finally, please note that if you specifically consent to additional uses of your pii, we may use your pii in manner consistent with that consent. compliance with legal requirements we may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal, judicial, or administrative process (such as a court order, subpoena, administrative request, or other governmental agency process or otherwise); (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical, criminal, financial, or other harm, injury, or loss or to enforce or defend our or others’ rights, property, or safety.  however, this policy is not intended to limit any objections or legal defenses you may have to a request to disclose your information by a third party or government. information generally disclosed we may also share aggregated, anonymized, and other non-pii publicly, for example in industry reports, news stories or press releases, to show trends about the general use of our services, the boxed sites and the boxed apps. information disclosed in connection with business transactions we may also transfer the information we have about you in the event we enter into negotiations to or consummate a transaction to sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our businesses or assets (or initiate and pursue reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation), or take other steps in anticipation of such transactions.  in such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this policy. 4. children’s privacy rights we do not

service. to protect your information, we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all third-party services that you, either directly or indirectly through your use of programs, browsers, extensions and other services, use and/or access.  visiting, utilizing, or accessing third-party services is at your own risk. when you use the boxed sites, third parties, including third-party services, may collect your information or information about your online and mobile activities over time and across different websites, social media pages, internet-connected programs and services and mobile apps.  for example, certain third parties may embed content, tools, use cookies, pixel tags, beacons and other tracking and display technologies to serve and offer relevant services, ads and links on the boxed sites and through third-party services. we have no control over these third parties and no responsibility for the technologies they employ.  we are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third parties or their collection of information, and our policy does not apply to such collection of information or to the services offered by these third parties. we suggest you review their privacy policies to learn how they may collect or use your information. the boxed sites may also contain links to social media platforms and individual pages

destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. no method of protecting information is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  therefore, we suggest that you take

stored in auto-fill services on your browser, mobile device or other hardware and software used for accessing your account and your pii generally.  it is preferable that users update their password periodically and follow conventions for choosing a secure password, including, without limitation, by using a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols and by not reusing

long as is the purposes for which you made such information available remains active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter, or if applicable, for as long as required by law or other governmental process.  even if we delete some or all of your pii, we may continue to retain and use aggregated and/or anonymized data previously collected that is de-linked from specific pieces
