resident of the state of california and (b) under 16 years of age, or (2) under 13 years of age, then, in each case, you are not permitted to use any portion of the boxed sites. as discussed below, you must be at least 21 years of age to purchase alcoholic beverages (as defined below), or use any site functionality related to alcoholic beverages. access and license subject to your compliance with the terms and the intended use of the boxed services and the boxed sites and your payment of any costs or fees for the boxed services, we hereby grant you a single, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable limited personal license to access and use the boxed services and the boxed sites. any violation, misuse, or breach of, or failure to comply with, the terms shall result in the immediate revocation and termination of the licenses granted to you in these terms, without notice to you by us, in our sole discretion. all rights not expressly granted to you in the terms are reserved and retained by boxed or its licensors, suppliers, publishers, rights holders, or other content providers. much of the information and data and many of the images on the boxed sites are updated on a real-time basis, and are proprietary or may be licensed to us by others. therefore, except as permitted in these terms, you may not reproduce, distribute, use, display, sell, lease, transmit, create derivative works from, translate, modify, reverse-engineer, disassemble, decompile, hack or otherwise exploit the boxed services or the boxed sites, or any portion thereof, unless expressly permitted by us in writing prior to such action. apart from web browsers, mobile operating systems and approved apis, you agree not to use any software, program, application

sites or otherwise assign any rights to the boxed services or boxed sites in whole or in part. 5. pricing, taxes, order requirements, gift cards, and promotions pricing and reported savings boxed continuously works to offer competitive prices on everything we carry. from time to time, prices are subject to change in our sole discretion.  in certain instances and for certain products, we may also report suggested savings as a percentage. the percentage savings we report are based on a comparison of prices for bulk or wholesale sizes of products available on the boxed sites against the prices for equivalent or similar bulk or wholesale sizes of products or retail sizes available on national e-commerce retail websites and mobile applications. fees from time to time, additional fees may be applied to your purchase of select items on the boxed sites, which may include, for example, specialty fees, fees for express or other boxed services, cold pack delivery or other fees.  any such fees will be disclosed on the product page or at checkout, if applicable. if you do not agree to pay the fees, you will not be able to purchase these select items. taxes items sold on the boxed sites or through the boxed services may be subject to tax, governmental charges, or deposit fees. in most cases, prior to submitting your purchase request, you will see an estimate of the taxes and other fees to be collected on your order. this amount will depend on various factors, including the items purchased, the shipment destination, and, in certain circumstances, the identity of the seller (if not boxed). in certain limited circumstances and for certain third-party sellers, the tax amount may be included in the price of a product. unless specifically indicated on a product’s description page or the checkout page, items sold through the express service (see below), or age-restricted items (including alcoholic beverages (as defined below)), boxed is the seller of items purchased on the boxed sites or through the boxed services. any applicable tax on those items will be applied to the item price you pay for taxable items, less any savings amounts. with respect to those products that are not sold by boxed, such products will be subject to tax based on the sales tax collection obligations of the applicable seller. applicable tax on such orders will be applied to the item price indicated by the seller. for these items, savings amounts will not always reduce the price at which tax is charged. shipping boxed only ships to the 48 contiguous states and the district of columbia. we do not ship to alaska, hawaii or to united states territories and protectorates. other than express orders and orders fulfilled by third parties, shipments are delivered by ups®, fedex®, or other private courier (“delivery service”).  we will share your delivery information (name, location/address and phone number) with the delivery service for the sole purpose of facilitating the delivery of your boxed order to you. express orders, shipments of alcoholic beverages (as defined below), and shipments of products marketed through the boxed services and/or boxed sites, but fulfilled by third parties, are each shipped separately from other boxed products sold through the boxed services or on the boxed sites. the exact delivery date of your order may depend on several factors, including, without limitation, the date and time you place your order, whether you are enrolled in boxed up, the schedules and processes of our shipping partners, holiday schedules, weather, and other factors. even though we try to anticipate delays, we cannot predict or always prepare for delays caused by carriers, mistakes in delivery or shipment information, changes to orders, strikes, bad weather, or other similar circumstances. your order may arrive in one or several boxes over the course of one or more days. if there is a delay, we will do whatever we can to help move things along, although we cannot promise we’ll be able to resolve the delay. when you receive your order, remember to use discretion when lifting boxes and removing items. from time to time, we receive requests to pack orders in multiple boxes. we cannot guarantee that we can or will fulfill such requests. boxed is not responsible for orders that are lost or stolen. if you have questions about your delivery, please contact us at support@boxed.com. minimum or maximum order requirements and free shipping we and our partners may, in our sole discretion, set and adjust minimum (or maximum) quantity and/or price requirements from time to time for any order or attempted order placed on the boxed sites. we and our partners may also, in our sole discretion, set and adjust minimum (or maximum) quantity and/or price requirements from time to time for any user to receive free shipping on any order placed on the boxed sites, which quantity and price requirements may be lower for enrollees in boxed up or in connection with certain promotions. premium boxed services we may provide certain premium products and services from time to time, which boxed may charge you to access. you may access such paid portions of the boxed services and the boxed sites upon entering valid payment information and maintaining such payment method in full force and effect so long as the paid services are provided by boxed and accessed by you.  you understand that such paid services may be governed by additional terms and conditions specific to such paid services. for the terms and conditions applicable to boxed up, click here. you acknowledge and agree that boxed may, at any time and without notice, in its sole discretion, change its payment policies for the paid services, or the premium products and services provided thereunder, including, without limitation, by converting any or all portions of the boxed services and access to the boxed sites into paid services. terms of promotions from time-to-time, we may make certain offers, sales, promo codes (defined below), offer cards and gift codes, services, discounts, coupon offerings, giveaways, promotional credits, cash rewards (as defined below), free samples, specials, user-generated content opportunities, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions (each a “promotion” and, collectively, the “promotions”) available to you. promotions may be publicized on the boxed sites, through advertisements, and/or through other marketing channels. if you participate in, use, or apply any promotion, you will be subject to the terms and any additional terms, conditions, rules, and policies applicable to the promotion. unless otherwise disclosed in any applicable promotion-specific terms, disclaimers, conditions, rules, or policies, promotions are not combinable with other promotions, have expiration dates, cannot be applied to past purchases, are subject to certain caps and limitations, are only valid for their intended audience, are non-transferable, cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent, can only be used once per household, can only be redeemed through the boxed sites or the boxed services, and may be modified, replaced, suspended or terminated at any time by boxed at boxed’s sole discretion. certain promotions shall only be applicable on repeat orders. boxed determines, in its sole discretion, the accrual rates, redemption amounts and thresholds, and method and timing for the application or implementation of any promo code, cash rewards, discount, promotional credits or other promotion and/or any other restrictions as may be determined and communicated by boxed in its sole discretion. only valid promo codes provided or promoted by boxed will be honored at checkout. theft, reproduction, duplicate requests and/or other behavior intended to circumvent the proper redemption of promo codes is prohibited and may constitute fraud. where noted, you must add giveaway items to cart, select coupons to have such coupons apply to your order, or enter any discount codes at checkout. certain promotions shall only be applicable to first orders. unless otherwise specified in the terms and conditions of the particular promotion, promotions shall never apply to orders placed through business accounts that utilize separate credit terms agreed to with boxed. boxed may exclude certain product categories, certain specific products, and certain brands from promotions from time to time in the exercise of boxed’s sole discretion.  such exclusions may include boxed hotels, alcoholic beverages (as defined below), and other goods and services sold and/or shipped by third parties listing their goods on the boxed sites from time to time.  additionally, certain promotions may only be accessed or used by current enrollees in boxed up. free product samples boxed users may have access to free product samples, as offered from time-to-time by boxed, in its sole discretion. product samples are subject to availability and may be replaced by boxed with substitutes of greater, equivalent, or lesser value to any sample advertised by boxed or selected by you. to receive free product samples, you must add the requested samples to your cart on one of the boxed sites prior to checking out. if free product samples are not added to your cart before checkout, such samples will not be included in your order. free product samples cannot be added to previously placed orders.  creating multiple accounts, placing multiple orders and/or other behaviors intended to circumvent the proper redemption of free product samples is prohibited and may constitute fraud, and, as a result, boxed may revoke any or all your rights granted under these terms. in certain circumstances, all of the products in your boxed order may be fulfilled solely by a third-party or express shopper. in such circumstances, boxed shall be under no obligation to provide, ship, or replace any free product samples. we’re the buy-in-bulk business – we try not to ship such small packages! boxed may include a free product sample in your order that does not require your selection or express addition to your cart (including as part of a holiday “goodie” bag!). by using the boxed services and boxed sites, you agree to receive free product samples provided by boxed without any action by you, subject to availability and in boxed’s sole discretion. you understand that it is important to read the ingredients contained in free sample products, which may be made with known food allergens. we do not separate products based on their listed ingredients and the potential for any ingredient to be an allergen. promotional codes notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, boxed may, in boxed's sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for discounts, credit, or other features or benefits related to the boxed services, boxed sites, or third-party provider's services, subject to terms that boxed establishes on a per promotional code basis (“promo codes”). you agree that promo codes: (i) shall only be used by the intended audience and for the intended purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless expressly permitted by boxed; (iii) may be disabled by boxed at any time for any reason without liability to boxed and without notice; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that boxed establishes for such promo code; (v) are not valid for cash; (vi) may expire prior to your use; and (vii) must be entered and applied at checkout. placing multiple orders, and/or other behavior intended to circumvent the proper redemption of promo codes is prohibited and may constitute fraud, and, as a result, boxed may in its sole discretion revoke any or all your rights granted under these terms. boxed reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of promo codes by you or any other user in the event that boxed determines or believes that the use or redemption of the promo code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable promo code terms or these terms. from time-to-time, we may offer promo codes that are redeemable towards a purchase on the boxed sites or through the boxed services, while supplies last, and subject to certain merchandise exclusions or any other restrictions, as may be determined and communicated by us in our sole discretion. only valid promo codes provided or promoted by us will be honored at checkout. other codes supplied or promoted by third parties unauthorized by us (including any unauthorized third-party websites) will not be considered valid. unless otherwise stated in a particular promo codes’s terms and conditions, each promo code is non-transferable and valid for single use (limit one per order) on an item (or items) of merchandise as determined by boxed. promo codes cannot be used towards purchase of non-branded merchandise, packaging or applicable taxes. promo codes must be entered in the “apply promo code/gift card” or similar field at checkout. promo codes are valid through the boxed sites only. we are not responsible for lost, stolen or corrupted promo codes or any unauthorized use of promo codes. promo codes cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent; no substitutions or credits allowed. the dollar value of any promo codes will not be refunded or credited back if any or all of the merchandise is returned. expiry dates may apply to each promo code. promo codes are void if copied, transferred, sold, exchanged or expired, and where prohibited. requests not complying with all promotional code requirements will not be honored. boxed-branded gift cards from time-to-time, in our sole discretion, we may offer boxed-branded gift cards and/or gift certificates (“boxed gift cards”) for purchase by our customers. boxed gift cards are subject to the terms and conditions on the boxed gift card product detail page in effect at the time of purchase. boxed gift cards are not “credit cards” and cannot be used as such. boxed gift cards are assigned a fixed monetary value in united states dollars and should be treated as cash. use of a boxed gift card is limited to the amount of funds held on the boxed gift card and it is your responsibility to know the amount of available funds on your boxed gift card at all times. purchases of boxed gift cards are limited to no more than $2,000 in total funds (including reloads) per card per day, and each customer is limited to no more than $10,000 in the aggregate of boxed gift cards and other prepaid access products per day. boxed gift cards have no expiration date, and you will not be subject to any dormancy fee, transaction fee, or other fees for use or non-use of a gift card. boxed gift card balances may not be used to purchase additional or other boxed gift cards and cannot be reloaded, resold or transferred for value. for combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. only boxed-branded boxed gift cards may be redeemed as payment, and only one at a time, for any of the products on the boxed sites. boxed gift cards are not returnable or refundable for cash except in states where required by law. except to the extent required by applicable law, any unused boxed gift card balance will remain in the recipient's boxed gift card account and such balances are not transferable or refundable. the full amount of each purchase, including taxes, shipping and other applicable charges, will be deducted from the funds held on the gift card, up to the total funds available on the gift card. if a purchase made with a boxed gift card exceeds the amount of the gift card, the balance must be paid by another valid payment method (i.e., credit card or debit card). boxed gift cards are subject to verification, and any boxed gift card that we believe, in our sole discretion, to have been purchased or obtained fraudulently or through illegal means will be subject to invalidation without refund. boxed gift cards may not be used in connection with any promotion, promo code, marketing, advertising or other promotional activities without prior approval of boxed. furthermore, the use of boxed gift cards in any manner that suggests, states or implies that any person, website, business, product or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, boxed is prohibited unless you receive prior written approval for such use from boxed. boxed may provide boxed gift card purchasers with information, or means to access information, about the redemption status of boxed gift cards from time to time. boxed reserves the right to change these terms and conditions from time to time in its discretion, subject to compliance with all applicable laws. the most current version of any given boxed gift card’s terms and conditions will be available on such boxed gift card’s product details page, and this policy will be available on this site and each will supersede all previous versions of the boxed gift card’s terms and conditions and this policy. your continued use of a boxed gift card is your acceptance of all then-current terms and conditions. boxed gift cards are void if not obtained in accordance with these terms and conditions and through legitimate channels. boxed makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to gift cards, including without limitation, any express or implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. in the event a gift card is non-functional (whether due to physical or electronic issues with such gift card), your sole remedy, and our sole liability, shall be the replacement of such gift card, to the extent permitted by applicable law. the risk of loss and title for gift cards pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the recipient at the address provided by recipient to boxed, whichever is applicable. boxed is not responsible for any gift card that is lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission. without limiting any limitation of liability provision contained herein, in no event will boxed be liable for any punitive, special, indirect, or consequential damages, or loss of revenue or income, lost profits, exemplary, cost of substitute goods or services, or similar damages suffered or incurred by you or any third party in connection with any person’s use, or boxed’s provision, of any gift card. boxed gift cards and their use on the boxed sites are subject to the terms and privacy policy, which are available here and here, respectively. for any questions concerning your gift card(s), please contact the email and/or phone number provided on the boxed gift card’s product detail page or support@boxed.com. use of any boxed gift card for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. third-party gift cards from time to time, boxed may sell or otherwise market on the boxed sites third-party gift cards (“third-party gift cards”) that may be redeemable on third-party sites and/or in third-party stores.  these third-party gift cards will be subject to their own terms and conditions, located on the respective product pages or otherwise made available by the third party offering the third-party gift card. each customer is limited to no more than $10,000 in the aggregate of prepaid access products per day, including boxed gift-branded gift cards. marketing communications as a user of the boxed services and sites, you may have opportunities to opt in to receive various types of marketing communications from or on behalf of boxed, including but not limited to newsletters, promotional emails, sms messages and direct mail (“communications”).  you may manage your enrollment in certain of these communications via your account settings or through the communications themselves. cash rewards we are pleased to offer a cash rewards promotional program to eligible customers from time to time, which eligibility is determined in boxed’s sole discretion. this promotion is one way in which boxed endeavors to reward and thank loyal customers for frequenting our business and purchasing items through the boxed services and the boxed sites. users must create an account with boxed to be eligible to participate in the cash rewards promotional program. by registering, accessing, or using cash rewards (as defined below), you agree to be bound by the terms. the cash rewards program works as follows: when making qualified purchases on the boxed sites, an eligible user may receive a rewards credit (“cash rewards”) based on the total amount of their purchase excluding taxes and governmental fees, discounts on account of any applicable promotions and/or promo codes, the application of any accrued cash rewards, shipping charges, and express delivery charges; for each such purchase (i) prior to april 1, 2018, a boxed user could earn 1% in cash rewards; and (ii) after april 1, 2018, an eligible user enrolled in boxed up could earn 2% in cash rewards, in each case, on the total amount of his or her purchase excluding tax, discounts on account of any applicable promotions and/or promo codes, the application of any accrued cash rewards, shipping charges, and express delivery charges; the total amount of cash rewards earned on any particular order will be rounded down to the nearest whole penny; as noted above, a user will not, however, earn cash rewards on account of the portion of any purchase that is paid for with the user’s cash rewards, any promotion, or any promo code. for example, if a user purchases $100 worth of products, applies a promo code for 10% off an order of $75 or more, and uses cash rewards of $25 to pay for the order, the user will earn either 1% or 2% (depending on the date of purchase) cash rewards on account of the remaining $65 paid for with the user’s credit card or other form of payment; neither the purchase nor the application of a boxed gift card will qualify as a purchase that will earn cash rewards for the user purchasing or applying the boxed gift card; cash rewards accumulated by a user may only be used to pay, in whole or in part, for future purchases by the user on the boxed sites in accordance with these terms; cash rewards will expire twelve (12) months from the date earned unless (i) such cash rewards are redeemed in accordance with the redemption rules and instructions in effect from time to time; or (ii) any additional qualified purchases are made during the period prior to the expiration of the cash rewards in your account, in which case all unexpired cash rewards in your account will be renewed for an additional twelve (12) month period and will expire twelve (12) months from the date the qualifying renewal activity occurred (see “expiration of cash rewards” section below for more detail); and cash rewards have no actual cash value until such time as a user applies cash rewards to pay for a purchase on the boxed sites and cannot be redeemed for cash or any other form of consideration. a user’s accumulated cash rewards will be reported under the user’s “my account” tab. the value of a user’s accumulated cash rewards will be capped at $450 for any 12-month period, with the first such 12-month period beginning upon registration by the user. if a user earns $450 during any 12-month period, cash rewards will stop accruing until the 12-month period expires. a user is only eligible to accrue cash rewards on one account. cash rewards are linked to each user and may not be sold to, transferred to, assigned to, or shared with another account, family, friends or others. cash rewards cannot be transferred by operation of law, such as, without limitation, through inheritance, bankruptcy, or in connection with a divorce. there is a minimum balance of cash rewards required to redeem cash rewards on an eligible purchase, and boxed may set, modify, lower, or increase that minimum balance, from time to time, in its sole discretion. cash rewards are not eligible where prohibited by law or regulation. cash rewards may not be earned from purchases of, eligible for, or redeemable on certain categories of goods, as determined at our sole discretion, which may change without notice. cash rewards are not your property. boxed owns all property rights or other legal interests in all cash rewards and a user has no property rights or other legal interests in the cash rewards. from time to time, we may partner with a third party to offer you cash rewards that accrue at a higher rate, or on different terms, than set forth above, at our sole discretion.  we may set, modify, lower, or increase, in our sole discretion, any minimum amount of cash rewards that a user must accrue before becoming eligible to apply such rewards to a purchase. if a user’s account is suspended or terminated, or if a user’s enrollment in the boxed up program terminates or is cancelled, all accrued cash rewards will also be suspended, terminated and/or cancelled, as applicable. we may revoke any accrued cash rewards at any time, and without notice, in our sole discretion. boxed reserves the right to terminate your account and/or your participation in cash rewards if boxed determines in its sole discretion that you have violated the terms, you have more than one (1) account, or that the use of your account is unauthorized, deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful. this cash rewards program, along with the boxed services and the boxed sites, are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13 and may only be used by individuals under the age of 18 with the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use cash rewards under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the terms. boxed may exclude certain product categories, certain specific products, and certain brands from the cash rewards from time to time in the exercise of boxed’s sole discretion, including in connection with the accrual of cash rewards, or their redemption.  such exclusions may include boxed hotels, alcoholic beverages (as defined below), and other goods and services sold and/or shipped by third parties listing their goods on the boxed sites from time to time. boxed may also limit the cash rewards program to enrollees in boxed’s premium offerings, including, without limitation, boxed up, or may exclude certain user and account types from participation in cash rewards (for example, enterprise or business to business accounts). changes to cash rewards boxed reserves the right to terminate, amend, cancel, or temporarily suspend the cash rewards program, in whole or in part, or change any of the applicable terms, at any time for any or no reason, as determined in boxed’s sole discretion without notice to the cash rewards enrollee. if any change to these terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. your continued participation in the cash rewards program after we change any applicable terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. if you do not agree to any changes, you must cancel or terminate your participation in cash rewards program. expiration of cash rewards from time-to-time, first-time users of the boxed services or the boxed sites may earn cash rewards just by establishing a new account with a valid username and password (the “new user cash rewards”). a user’s new user cash rewards will automatically expire, if such user does not have cash rewards earning activity, such as by making a purchase on the boxed sites, within 90 days of establishing the new account with boxed for first-time users of the boxed services or the boxed sites prior to october 1, 2017, and 45 days of establishing the new account with boxed for first-time users of the boxed services or the boxed sites on or after october 1, 2017. thereafter, you must have cash rewards earning activity (as defined below) once every twelve (12) months in order to retain access to the cash rewards in your account.  if your account has no cash rewards earning activity in the applicable period above, all cash rewards available in your account will expire and terminate. cash rewards earning activity extends the expiration date of all unexpired cash rewards available in your account for an additional twelve (12) months from the date of the cash rewards earning activity. for purposes of these terms and the cash rewards program, “cash rewards earning activity” shall mean making qualifying purchases on the boxed sites or through the boxed services. third party sites & ads the boxed services and boxed sites may contain links to third-party websites, services, and advertisements for third parties

purchase of your order and is departing from the local store; and notify you  when the shopper is approaching the delivery destination. the shopper will use commercially reasonable efforts to send you these types of sms notifications, but, the shopper may be unable and/or sms notifications may not transmit. you agree that we or the shopper may contact you, using the mobile phone number you provide,

not authorized or required to bring your express order inside or unpack the order. the exact delivery time of your order may depend on several factors, including, without limitation, holiday schedules, weather, traffic or automobile issues, and other factors. even though we try to anticipate delays, we cannot predict or always prepare for delays caused by changes to orders, strikes, bad

address is in an area that allows delivery of alcoholic beverages to a resident. certain states, counties, cities, and towns expressly prohibit the direct shipment of alcoholic beverages to consumers and violation of such laws, rules, and/or regulations can be punishable as a misdemeanor or felony. additionally, some states, counties, cities, and towns limit the quantity and type of alcoholic beverages permitted to be shipped to an individual address or individual consumer, and licensed vendors may cancel any order requests that exceed such limitations. if you have any questions about such local laws, rules, and/or regulations, please contact your local agency for further information. if any communication from this web site is not in conformity with any jurisdiction rules and

review of an arbitration award is limited. instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms as a court would. boxed and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. the arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees. boxed and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision and other applicable terms, boxed and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. boxed and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in
