certain third-party sellers, the tax amount may be included in the price of a product. unless specifically indicated on a product’s description page, the checkout page or items sold through the express service (see below), boxed is the seller of items purchased on the boxed sites or through the boxed services. any applicable tax on those items will be applied to the item price you pay for

balance will remain in the recipient's gift card account and such balances are not transferable or refundable. the full amount of each purchase, including taxes, shipping and other applicable charges, will be deducted from the funds held on the gift card, up to the total funds available on the gift card. if a purchase made with a gift card exceeds the amount of the gift card, the balance must be

boxed to be eligible to participate in the cash rewards promotional program. by registering, accessing, or using cash rewards (as defined below), you agree to be bound by the terms. the cash rewards program works as follows: when making qualified purchases on the boxed sites, a user is eligible to receive a rewards credit (“cash rewards”) based on the total amount of their purchase excluding tax, promotional discounts on account of any applicable promotions, the application of any accrued cash rewards, shipping charges and express delivery charges;for each such purchase, a user will earn 1% in cash rewards on the total amount of his or her purchase excluding tax, promotional discounts on account of any applicable promotions, the application of any accrued cash rewards, shipping charges and express delivery charges;the total amount of cash rewards earned on any particular order will be rounded down to the nearest whole penny;as noted above, a user will not, however, earn cash rewards on account of the portion of any purchase that is paid for with the user’s cash rewards. for example, if a user purchases $100 worth of products and uses cash rewards of $25 to pay for the order, the user will earn 1% cash rewards on account of the remaining $75 paid for with the user’s credit card or other form of payment;neither the purchase nor the application of a boxed gift card will qualify as a purchase that will earn cash rewards for the user purchasing or applying the boxed gift card;cash rewards accumulated by a user may only be used to pay, in whole or in part, for future purchases by the user on the boxed sites in accordance with these terms; andcash rewards have no actual cash value until such time as a user applies cash rewards to pay for a purchase on the boxed sites and cannot be redeemed for cash or any other form of consideration. a user’s accumulated cash rewards will be reported under the user’s “my account” tab. the value of a user’s accumulated cash rewards will be capped at $450 for any 12-month period, with the first such 12-month period beginning upon registration by the user. if a user earns $450 during any 12-month period, cash rewards will stop accruing until the 12-month period expires. a user is only eligible to accrue cash rewards on one account. cash rewards are linked to each user and may not be sold to, transferred to, assigned to, or shared with another account, family, friends or others. cash rewards cannot be transferred by operation of law, such as, without limitation, through inheritance, bankruptcy, or in connection with a divorce. there is a minimum balance of cash rewards required to redeem cash rewards on an eligible purchase, and boxed may set that minimum balance, from time-to-time, in its sole discretion. cash rewards are not eligible where prohibited by law or regulation. cash rewards may not be earned from purchases of, eligible for, or redeemable on certain categories of goods, as determined at our sole discretion, which may change without notice. cash rewards are not your property. boxed owns all property rights or other legal interests in all cash rewards and a user has no property rights or other legal interests in the cash rewards. we may set, in our sole discretion, any minimum amount of cash rewards that a user must accrue before becoming eligible to apply such rewards to a purchase. if a user’s account is suspended or terminated, all accrued cash rewards will also be suspended and/or terminated. we may revoke any accrued cash rewards at any time, and without notice, in our sole discretion. boxed reserves the right to terminate your account and/or your participation in cash rewards if boxed determines in its sole discretion that you have violated the terms, you have more than

amend, cancel or temporarily suspend the cash rewards program, in whole or in part, or change any of the applicable terms, at any time for any or no reason, as determined in boxed’s sole discretion without notice to the member. if any change to these terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. your continued participation in the cash rewards program after we change any applicable terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. if you do not agree to any changes, you must cancel or terminate your participation in cash rewards program.expiration of cash rewardsfrom time-to-time, first-time users of the boxed services or the boxed sites may earn cash rewards just by establishing a new account with a valid username and password (the “new user cash rewards”). a user’s new user cash rewards will automatically expire, if such user does not have cash rewards earning activity, such as by making a purchase on the boxed sites, within ninety (90) days of establishing the new account with boxed. thereafter, you must have “cash rewards earning activity” (as defined below) once every 12 months in order to retain access to the cash rewards in your account. if your account has no cash rewards earning activity in any 12-month period, all cash rewards
