a: all stock jewelry items, (meaning any item available on the website,) precious metal upgrades, and products purchased from the dreambook are fully returnable within 30 days of when you receive them.  if you purchase a ring with an interchangeable head, (also called a “peg head,”) you also have 30 days to make any alterations you’d like to the gemstone size and/or cut. q: what about non-returnable items? a: only gift cards and the dreambook itself are non-returnable. q: really?  what about custom orders and engraved jewelry? a: even full custom orders are returnable, but do come with a 15% materials fee.  also, the original cad fee is not refundable.  likewise, engraving fees are non-refundable and returned engraved jewelry is subject to a $15 re-polishing fee.  but that’s it. q: how does diamond nexus labs determine its pricing? a: there are four factors to consider when pricing jewelry: gemstones, precious metals, design art/engineering, and artisanship.  essentially, this boils down to materials and labor.  a ring with elaborate filigree workmanship but a relatively small gemstone may cost more than a simple ring with a much larger gemstone, because it took much more work to create it.  two rings with the same fundamental design and the same size stones can be priced differently because one may have more precious metal than the other, or may be more difficult to cast. q: why are diamond nexus stones so much less expensive than other manufactured diamonds? a: we offer our products at the most reasonable prices we can. unfortunately, we can’t explain other companies’ pricing because we don’t have any information about their internal costs or structure. q: what are your stones made out of, and how are they different from natural diamonds? a: diamonds are made of carbon only.  our stones feature carbon and eight other additional elements: oxygen, sulphur, iron, cobalt, nickel, yttrium, zirconium, and hafnium. q: why can’t you make your stones with just carbon? a: actually, we have managed to create diamond simulants out of pure carbon, but they are limited in size and are very expensive to produce.  this would prevent us from making them affordable to you, so we are not selling them just yet.  we hope to perfect the process someday soon, though, and then we will make them available to the public. q: my neighbor’s cousin’s co-worker’s sister said that diamond nexus stones are just regular cz.  are they? a: no, actually they’re not.  cz, or cubic zirconia, contain only two elements: zirconium and oxygen.  while diamond nexus gemstones do also contain these elements, (which is where some people get confused,) they have seven more as well.  and while the manufacturing process of diamond nexus gemstones begins much the same as the manufacturing process of cz, there are many more steps and treatments involved in a diamond nexus gemstone.  the result is a different stone with different, better properties. q: so diamond nexus gemstones are not cz.  what makes them better? a: the problem with cz is that they’re not as strong as diamonds, and also they’re much more porous.  this means that they can break or chip at any time, and that they will absorb dirt and oils over the years to become cloudy and unattractive.  diamond nexus gemstones are made to be much harder and less porous – so much so, in fact, that their properties are almost exactly identical to natural diamonds.  this means that, unlike cz, a diamond nexus gemstone will never break, never chip, and never lose its sparkle. it can even cut glass. q: why do you talk so much about ethics and environmental consciousness? a: the diamond industry is extremely notorious for its practices, not only in business but also in production.  aside from worldwide market manipulation, the diamond cartel has been tangled up in issues of slavery, mutilation, terrorism, and genocide for decades.  even legitimate diamond mining operations are responsible for massive deforestation, pollution, destruction of wildlife, and hazardous working conditions leading to the suffering and death of hundreds to thousands of workers.  we believe that diamond simulants are more than an affordable alternative to the hype that the cartel has worked up for its own benefit; we believe they may be a key factor in ending the cycle of violence, devastation, and murder. to learn more about the effects of the diamond cartel and conflict diamonds, we recommend glitter & greed: the secret world of the diamond cartel by janine roberts. glossary privacy statement list of all articles shipping information notification of copyright, trademark, and other proprietary information included on this web page. all components found on this site, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, and photos are proprietary information and copyrighted property of diamond nexus labs. no component of this web site may be copied or duplicated without prior written permission from diamond nexus labs. all proprietary rights to all names, trademarks and images contained on this web site, regardless of whether a trademark registration has been secured, are reserved. copyright 2006 diamond nexus labs. free catalog by mail.request yours today experience our award winning customer service risk free shopping information & education center shipping we accept ...
