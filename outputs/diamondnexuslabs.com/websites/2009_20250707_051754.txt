1- full custom design there are two paths to take to acquire your custom jewelry. the first is a full custom design. this is the best course when trying to replicate an existing design from a picture or a design that exists solely in your imagination. the only limit to a full custom design is your vision. our designers will work closely with you and produce a design that captures your desire. guided at every step by our skilled consultants, you will review a detailed blueprint and a computer aided design (cad) rendering of your jewelry piece before we create the finished jewelry. next > 2- the dreambook the second path to take is to order a jewelry piece from our diamond nexus labs "dreambook" custom catalog. sometimes you may know you want something different and unique, but you may not have a clear idea of exactly what your vision for your jewelry is. - the "dreambook" catalog is perfect for that situation. the catalog is a 762 page celebration of over ten thousand individual ring and pendant designs. from simple elegance to the most glamorous, outrageous creations, the dreambook catalog likely has a design to match your desires. all of the designs in the dreambook have specific information on ring dimensions, weights, costs, etc. most of the designs in the dreambook catalog can be modified to your specifications, set with natural diamonds, other colored natural or artificial gemstones, etc. it can serve as a wonderful wellspring of ideas. most designs available through the dreambook catalog are priced between $800 and $1500. the savings are realized as the mold already exists and does not have to be created from scratch. how do i find out more?
