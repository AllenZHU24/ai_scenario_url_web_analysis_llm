of fine jewelry is an emotional purchase, but it doesn't have to be an expensive one. furthermore, almost everyone loves the glamorous feeling of wearing fine diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, but few can afford to be fully arrayed the way they would like. and even if you can afford to spend a fortune, does that mean you should or want to? our celebrity clients certainly don't think so; icons as diverse as deidre hall and kate jackson can be seen sporting our jewelry both on and off the red carpet. dnl makes it possible to capture the style and quality you want at a price you can feel comfortable spending, and nobody else has to know where your stones came from unless you want to tell them. our stones rival the beauty of their mined counterparts. our synthetic ruby, emerald, and sapphire products are the exact optical, physical and chemical duplicates of natural mined gemstones. they are gemologically ideal and exhibit the finest deep, rich color. our diamond simulant product is the near exact optical and physical match to a natural mined diamond: it looks identical and wears identically, but the chemistry is different; it is not pure carbon. yet, it matches the look of the finest internally flawless, "d" color diamond. it will cut glass, it is impervious to wear, and will last forever. no one in the world can tell without scientific testing that your beautiful, radiant jewels were created in a lab. our products are made in an eco-friendly manner without harm to people or the environment. we at diamond nexus labs strive to produce heirloom quality jewelry for you to pass on to future generations, and to make sure that a healthy, clean environment is passed on as well. in many underdeveloped parts of the world, mining corporations exploit weak governments and lax environmental laws to strip mine and chemically extract diamonds and gold from the earth. these destructive processes often leave behind a poisoned, dead landscape, not to mention the exploitation of workers who are often unfairly treated. we do not believe that beauty has to come at this dear a price. our diamond nexus diamond simulants are created in clean laboratories using environmentally friendly processes. from the gold we use to the paper our catalogs are printed on, we recycle. we seek to leave the world as good as or better than it was when we found it. guaranteed risk free shopping. buying fine quality jewelry doesn't have to be a risk. we give you a worry-free 30 days to get to know your new diamond nexus purchase, complete with free

settings: solid 14k or 18k gold, pure platinum, and our exclusive lorián platinum alloy. heavy and full-weight, a diamond nexus setting often contains 15-20% more gold then a typical jewelry store setting. our jewelers, goldsmiths, and stonesetters are skilled artisans and you will immediately see and feel the quality of our jewelry when you hold it in your hand. the jewelry industry's top
