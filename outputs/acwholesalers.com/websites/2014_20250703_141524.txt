low price guarantee find an installer best value customer reviews distribution centers security & privacy our company about us contact us terms of use hvac network of stores careers news warranty coverage hvacstores will back up 100% of all warranties as to parts which are offered by the manufacturer. hvacstores offers only nationally known and established brands that provide a nationwide parts distribution network. most air conditioning contractors are authorized by these manufacturers to service these units and obtain free of charge replacement parts for the term of your warranties. accordingly, make sure you review and are familiar with the terms, language, and/or requirements for any applicable manufacturer's warranty. if a product should fail within the first thirty days of purchase due to part (s) failure, hvacstores will cover shipping fees to get the necessary replacement part (s) to you. after 30 days you are responsible for any applicable shipping fees for obtaining any replacement part (s). you also have the option of processing warranty claims with local heating and cooling contractors that service the products we sell. to validate your warranty claim, a licensed contractor must have either installed or inspected your equipment before start-up. without a receipt from a licensed contractor hvacstores cannot process warranty parts or claims for you. failure to submit the aforementioned receipt will result in denial of any warranty claim. if any product purchased from hvacstores.com should result in failure upon installation or not operate after installation, we are only responsible for supplying the parts warranted by the manufacturer. under no circumstances will either refrigerant r22 or r410a be covered or reimbursed if refrigerant needs to be re-added to the system; whether it is missing from the unit when it arrives to the customer's location or after a part is replaced. under no circumstances will hvacstores replace a whole system or component. hvacstores does not provide any warranty above and beyond the manufacturer's warranty as to parts. hvacstores is not liable for any warranties, or costs - and/or expenses incurred by the

from us and install on your own. any person or entity that decides on self-installation is responsible for and accepts all risk of both installation and equipment selection. any applicable manufacturer's warranty will be void if the installation is not completed by a licensed contractor. having these systems installed by a licensed contractor is more costly, but it has its advantages - professional installation, labor warranty may be provided by the contractor, the validation of your manufacturer's warranty, and potentially someone to process warranty claims for you.
