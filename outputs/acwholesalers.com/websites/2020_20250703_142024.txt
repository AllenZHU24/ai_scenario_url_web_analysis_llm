home / how-to library / shipping methods shipping methods for smaller products, we use standard shipping methods. larger products require freight curbside delivery. shipment times are average, but shipments to remote locations, shipments during the winter holiday season, and cases of extreme weather may exceed the estimated shipment times. for our standard shipping, we use a variety of common carriers that provide insurance and tracking. shipments often need to be signed for, while shipments can also be left at the driver's discretion. items using standard shipping have several speeds:     standard ground shipping (5-7 business days):   deliveries eligible for free shipping will have this option available. saturday and sunday deliveries are not available.     second day air (2 business days):   the day following the ship day is the first day. for example, an item that ships on friday (weekends excluded) will arrive on tuesday.     standard overnight (next business day):   provides next-business-day delivery by 3 p.m. to most addresses, and by 4:30 p.m. to rural areas. service days are monday through friday only (weekends excluded). this method is ideal for packages that need to be delivered by the end of the next business day.     freight ltl (3-6 business days):   for the larger pallet-driven shipments; normally over 150lbs to ensure their safe arrival. all orders are strapped and wrapped to a wooden grade 'a' pallet and conveniently delivered to your residential curb or place of business.     next: check your order status tags:  customer support, shipping call
