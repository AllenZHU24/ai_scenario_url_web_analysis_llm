you least expect it: the heating, ventilation, or air conditioning system goes out. now youre left in an uncomfortable situationyour hands on your head, wondering what to do. no worries, we have you covered! acwholesalers will back up 100% of all warranties to functional parts and/or product repair(s)/refurbishment(s) that are offered by the manufacturer.we pride ourselves in only working with the most reputable, trusted manufacturers in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industries that provide a nationwide parts distribution network. because of this, most air conditioning and heating professionals are authorized by these manufacturers to service these units, and obtain free-of-charge replacement/refurbished part(s) and/or provide a refurbished replacement(s) for the term of your warranty.   accordingly, make sure you review and are familiar with the terms, language, and/or requirements for any applicable manufacturer's warranty. warranty validation is solely dependent on the manufacturers requirements for the product(s) purchased.   how do i validate my warranty on products that require professional installation?   to validate your warranty, a licensed professional must have either fully installed or inspected your equipment before and including turning on the product(s) during initial start-up. after the initial start-up has been completed, the professional will provide you with a dated installation invoice detailing the model(s) and applicable serial number(s) of the equipment.we strongly recommend you keep that in a safe place for future reference, and, if possible, scan the document to keep a duplicate as a digital copy.some manufacturers also require registration with them of the product(s) installed within the first 30-60 days from installation / initial start-up to validate and receive the product(s) full warranty coverage. restrictions do apply, please see manufacturer's documentation shipped along with the product(s) or refer to applicable manufacturer's website for up-to-date warranty terms.we reserve the right to reject any warranty claim for a replacement part(s) and/or repairs if all or any of the required documentation is not provided at the time of filing a claim.   how do i validate my warranty on products that do not require professional installation?   some manufacturers only require you to keep the original purchase invoice, while others require registration with them of the product(s) purchased within the first 30-60 days of receiving the product(s) to validate the full warranty coverage. restrictions do apply, please see manufacturers documentation shipped along with the product(s) or refer to applicable manufacturer's website for up-to-date warranty terms.   my product failed after the first 30 days of purchase, what do i do?    should your product(s) cease to function, we strongly recommend contacting either the installing professional (if applicable) or contacting the manufacturer for troubleshooting. in most cases, issues can be resolved without replacing any part(s). if a product should fail after the first 30 days of purchase due to part(s) failure, fill out a warranty form detailing the part(s) needed for replacement. refer to applicable manufacturer's website for an up-to-date parts manual.remember to include the professionals installation invoice including the diagnostic invoices (when applicable) detailing how and which part(s) failed. the information is forwarded to and required by the manufacturer for authorization on your warranty claim.some manufacturers do require the entire product(s) be shipped to them for repairs. if this is applicable to you, you will be notified when you submit your warranty claim. after 30 days, you are responsible for any applicable shipping fees for obtaining any replacement and/or refurbished part(s). refer to applicable manufacturer's website for an up-to-date parts manual.acwholesalers is not liable for any installation/reinstallation and/or miscellaneous costs and/or expenses incurred after the first 30 days of purchase, nor will it provide reimbursements or compensation of any kind to any customer for a malfunction of any part(s) for any product(s) sold on our site. my home was struck by an act of god and my product(s) were damaged in the process, what do i do?    the manufacturers warranty normally holds no provisions for supplying replacement part(s) for products that were damaged due to an act of nature. please see manufacturer's documentation shipped along with the product(s) or refer to applicable manufacturer's website for an up-to-date warranty term coverages on acts of god. is the warranty of the product(s) transferable?    normally the warranty only covers the original owner of the residence and his or her spouse (owner) as of the installation date. some states and provinces do not allow limitations of warranty coverage to a new owner, so the above limitation may not apply to you. we recommend that you review the manufacturer's documentation shipped along with the product(s) or refer to applicable manufacturer's website for up-to-date warranty terms. does acwholesalers provide labor warranties?    no. acwholesalers does not directly provide any labor warranties or compensation of any kind for any costs incurred by the consumer due to malfunction of any part(s) for any products sold on our site. in most cases, the installing professional may be able to provide additional purchasable labor warranties. please inquire with them about pricing and availability.if any product purchased from acwholesalers should result in failure upon installation or not operate after installation, we are only responsible for supplying the part(s) warranted by the manufacturer. acwholesalers does not provide any warranty above and beyond the manufacturer's warranty as to parts. i had a leak in my unit and all the refrigerant leaked out. is that covered under warranty?    no. under no circumstances will any refrigerant (freon) (example: r22 or r410a) be covered or reimbursed if refrigerant needs to be re-added to the system; whether it is missing from the unit when it arrives at the customer's location or after a part(s) is/are replaced. does the warranty claim cover non-functional part(s)?    no. non-functional part(s) (such as a cosmetic panel) are not covered under the warranty policy. should you receive a product(s) that have damages, you must report those damages within the first 48 hours of receiving the products (excluding holidays and/or weekends). for additional information on our shipping policy, click here. if i have a warranty with a local professional, will acwholesalers cover any costs associated with a local warranty claim?    since we only work with the most reputable, trusted manufacturers in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industries, in most cases you have the option of processing warranty claims with local professionals. we understand that filing warranties locally can speed up the process to have your product(s) up and running faster; however, should you elect to take this avenue, acwholesalers cannot provide a warranty claim for replacement part(s) and/or repairs.   either your local distributor or acwholesalers can file a warranty claim for part(s) at any given time, not both at the same time for the same part(s). in some occasions, the local distributor may charge fees for processing and handling of your warranty claims since they did not sell the equipment directly. under no circumstances will acwholesalers reimburse any cost(s) incurred with performing any local warranty claims. how long does it take for a warranty agent to contact me once my warranty claim is submitted?    our normal response time via email or phone is within one to three business days (excluding holidays or weekends). to ensure the fastest processing possible, we ask that you provide more than two contact phone numbers and frequently check your email for updates.the total processing time of a warranty claim is determined by a few factors, such as manufacturer approval codes for replacement part(s) and/or repair, warranty part(s) availability, and customers speed of answering our request(s) in regard to providing additional information if required. are the replacement warranty part(s) refurbished?    in most cases the replacement part(s) are brand new; however, some manufacturers do provide refurbished warranty replacement part(s). if this is applicable to you, you will be notified when you submit your warranty claim. the manufacturer does run extensive testing on the refurbished product(s) to ensure its stability and full functionality. what does it mean to have my product repaired?    in some cases, the manufacturer will request the product(s) to be shipped to them for repairs. they diagnose the issue that occurred at the time of failure and repair/replace the part(s) required to ensure the product(s) are operational again. the manufacturer does run extensive testing on the repaired product(s) to ensure its stability and full functionality.if the defect is covered by the manufacturer's warranty, the item will be repaired free of charge and returned to you. repairs can take up to 10 business days (excluding delivery time) but may take slightly longer depending on several factors such as part(s) availability, troubleshooting time and repair time.should a repair be required within the first 30 days from purchase then shipping cost(s) will be covered by acwholesalers via the traceable ground services only. if you are outside of 30 days from the purchase, you will incur applicable shipping to and from fees which are non-refundable. acwholesalers is not liable for any costs and/or expenses incurred, nor will it provide reimbursements or compensation of any kind to any customer for a product(s) repair, uninstallation and reinstallation. what if my issue(s) are not covered by the warranty policy for items being repaired?    if the problem isn't covered by the manufacturer's warranty, or if the warranty has been voided (e.g., the item has been accidentally damaged or not installed by a professional when required), you'll be contacted by the repairer with a repair estimate. you can decide whether to ask the repairer to proceed with the repair at an additional cost or have the item returned to you. payment for such repairs, including any applicable delivery charges, will have to be made directly to the repairer. can a homeowner install the products sold on our site?    products that require installation sold on our site are intended by the manufacturers to be installed by professionals. they are available to you on this site as a means of saving a substantial amount of money. we know the advantage of self-installation, as well as any disadvantages, and it's your decision to purchase from us and install on your own. any person or entity that decides on self-installation is responsible for and accepts all risk of both installation and equipment selection.having these systems installed by a licensed professional is costly, but it has its advantages: professional installation, labor warranty (may be provided as an additional service by the professional), the validation of your manufacturer's warranty, and potentially someone to process warranty claims for you. most importantly, we recommend a professional for safety reasons. we strongly advise against any homeowners installing (if applicable) their own product(s).   most of the manufacturers of these product(s) sold on our site have no provisions to provide warranty replacement part(s) or technical support to the homeowner. they only work through dealers, such as your local heating and air conditioning professional.any and all applicable manufacturer's warranty will not be valid if the product(s) were not fully installed or if the product(s) were not inspected before and turned on by a professional during initial start-up. can the acwholesalers staff troubleshoot my product(s)?    our staff is extensively trained in all aspects of heating, ventilation and air conditioner home comfort products. they also go through rigorous on the job training to ensure our customers consistently receive the highest customer service in the industry. however, due to the technical nature of the product(s) we sell on our site, our staff does not provide any troubleshooting or diagnosing for any product(s). a professional needs to troubleshoot, diagnose - and/or pinpoint exact problem(s) including providing the model number(s) for the replacement part(s) before a warranty claim can be requested. my unit is not functioning and i want a new product(s) replacement. what do i do?    although sometimes it may seem like a quicker resolution to replace the whole product(s) or component(s), it may not necessarily be the right solution. most cases require a professional resetting the product(s) in order to make it functional again. before you file a warranty request, we strongly recommend you contact a professional to diagnosis your product(s).sometimes manufacturers will have provisions for homeowners to contact their technical support hotline for assistance in troubleshooting. we recommend you review the manufacturer's documentation (which is shipped along with the product(s)) or refer to the applicable manufacturer's website for up-to-date troubleshooting hotline availability.should the manufacturer authorize a product(s) replacement, there will be applicable shipping cost(s) to and from our facility. acwholesalers is not liable for any costs and/or expenses incurred, nor will it provide reimbursements or compensation of any kind to any customer for troubleshooting and/or product(s) replacement uninstallation and reinstallation.     warranty processing options available to our customer   to facilitate replacement part(s) for our customers, we offer two different warranty processing options. these processing options are available to customers requesting warranty replacement part(s) only. should the manufacturer require the entire product(s) back for repairs, then the only method of warranty processing is standard (no exceptions can be made). what is the advanced warranty processing?    do you need your product(s) up and running immediately? if so, then the advanced warranty processing option is the way to go. after the warranty claim is approved for replacement part(s), we will ship the replacement part(s) to you first, before receiving your defective in return. this way you can rest easy knowing that your product(s) will be up and running again as soon as possible. always take the following into account when requesting a warranty claim: possible lead time(s) of the replacement part(s) (should they need to be ordered from the manufacturers) and shipping transit times from our facilities. does the advanced warranty processing option have any charges associated for the replacement of part(s)?    yes. a valid credit card is required and will be charged to ensure that acwholesalers receives the defective returned part(s) within 30 days from the date on which the replacement part(s) were shipped. should we not receive your defective part(s) within the allocated time period, it is considered a part purchase, not a warranty claim, and a refund will not be applicable. does the advanced warranty processing option have any charges for shipping costs?    yes. shipping fees are applicable and non-refundable as they are not covered by our warranty policy unless the warranty request has been made within 30 days of purchase. if within the 30 days of purchase, a return label will be sent via email for the defective part once we have shipped the replacement part. i want the advanced warranty processing option. who do i tell?    on the warranty claim form, there is a warranty option section on which you can choose advanced warranty processing option. also, after the warranty claim is approved for a replacement part(s), you will be contacted either via email or phone with instructions on how your request will be handled. please notify the warranty agent who contacts you that you wish to select the advanced warranty processing option. can i send you my credit card information via email to expedite my request?    we ask all of our customers, for their safety, not to email us any pertinent data concerning credit card information such as the credit card numbers, expiration dates, cvv numbers and other information of a sensitive nature. do i need to include anything with the return of my defective warranty part(s)?    yes. when you ship your defective part(s) to our facilities, a few things will be required.first, all defective part(s) being returned require the return
