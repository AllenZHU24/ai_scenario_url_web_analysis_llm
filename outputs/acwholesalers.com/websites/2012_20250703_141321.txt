air conditioning systems are two of the most important investments of home ownership. in fact, heating and air conditioners are major factors for those looking to purchase homes, and are a critical part of living comfortably in a home. air conditioning systems are classified as central air conditioners, room air conditioners, and ductless air conditioners. central heating and cooling is the most standard method, and is defined by a system that produces warm or cool air in one central area and then distributes it throughout the home. an air-conditioning system provides air conditioning, ventilation, humidity control and even heating (if using a heat pump, and or furnace) for a home. there are many types of systems that work as central air conditioning systems, from traditional split systems to packaged product systems. products typically used in central heating and cooling systems are heat pumps, air conditioners, gas and oil furnaces, fan coils, evaporator coils, single packaged products (all in on systems) controls and thermostats room air conditioners are examples of local heating and cooling. products such as room air conditioners, window air conditioner, wall air conditioner, portable air conditioners, and portable heaters are local cooling and heating options for smaller areas within homes. instead of delivering cooled refrigerant to a coil and then to ductwork, a room air conditioner contains all the components in a single unit and blows air directly into a room. the term "hvac," is used frequently to describe home heating and air conditioning systems. the acronym stands for heating, ventilation and air conditioning which are the primary functions of a home comfort system. as the name states, a ductless air conditioner or ductless heat pump does not rely upon air ducts to route treated air through your home or office. these systems are an affordable alternative to central heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (hvac ) systems, which need a network of ducts to move air. ductless air conditioners are generally considered to be more efficient and easier to maintain than room air conditioners and ptac's. they are available in floor mounted, wall mounted, ceiling cassettes, ceiling suspended and in single zone, and multi zone units covering up to 8 rooms. acwholesalers.com is here to help you find any home comfort product
