sometimes, though very rarely, one box may still be in transit while another has already been delivered. q: can i select a certain carrier for my order? a: because nutricity.com sells a variety of items at a variety of sizes, we also use a variety of carriers for our products. our systems will automatically choose the best, most efficient carrier for your particular order. nutricity.com ships packages using three carriers: dhl global mail, u.s. postal service (usps), and fedex. generally, all items up to 5 pounds will be shipped out via dhl global mail, who then transfers their orders to the usps. all orders above 5 pounds will automatically be assigned by our system to be shipped via either usps or federal express, whichever is most efficient. similarly, orders that were placed using expedited shipping will be automatically sent via either usps priority mail or fedex express. all international orders and most orders above 5 pounds that are shipped outside the continental united states will be sent out via usps. because the shipping method is selected automatically through our system to maintain efficiency of your delivery, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that your order will be sent out via any certain provider. q: i placed an order, but how can i change the address? a: for your safety, nutricity does not change addresses on orders that have already been placed. due to the safety of our customers, we would process a cancellation on the order, as we do not want to risk sending the items out to the wrong address. any refunds that may need processing will be processed as well. the order can then be re ordered with the correct shipping address. q: what's the difference between and order that says, "processed" and "shippped"? a: if you hear that your order has been "processed," this means that the items for your order are being prepped to be shipped out to you. an order that has been "shipped" has left our facility and is now with the carrier. q: my order says it's shipping but where's the tracking? a: tracking information can often take one to two days after shipping to show any activity on the website of each carrier. if you are concerned that your order has not been tracking properly or has come to a stop, please contact customer service. q: what does it mean when my tracking says "undeliverable address"? a: if you’re tracking number states that your order is "undeliverable," this means that the address on the label is incorrect, the addressee is not at the address given, and or the mail is unclaimed or the package was refused. back to top go back to faq by topic shopping cart there is 1 item in your cart. sub-total: $66.24 nutricity family core value 1. five star customer service all the time what is the nutricity family doing? enter your email for sweet offers! wait... popular searches weight management minerals protein supplement gluten free natural baby products cold & flu medicine alvita teas coq10 shop by health concern antioxidant support immune support bone support joint support heart health cholesterol support colon health adrenal support medicine cabinet allergy remedies cough remedies sleep remedies cold sore remedies motion sickness remedies insect repellent pain relief antiseptics vitamin and supplements vitamin a vitamin b vitamin c multivitamin resveratrol amino acids all vitamins all supplements my account log in/register my account my cart my order history my reward points help all star customer service contact us returns policy shipping international orders returns and cancellations faq's prop 65 warning get to know us! about us careers privacy policy conditions of use locations top 10! connect with us! badges copyright © 2006-2013 nutricity.com, llc. all rights reserved . designated trademarks and brands are the property of their respective owners. the products and the claims made about specific products on or through this site have not been evaluated by nutricity.com or the united states food and drug administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease. the information provided on this site is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for advice from your physician or other health care professional or any information contained on or in any product label or packaging. you should not use the information on this site for diagnosis or treatment of any health problem or for prescription of any medication or other treatment. you should consult with a healthcare professional before starting any diet, exercise or supplementation program, before taking any medication, or if you have or suspect you might have a health problem. prices and promotions are subject to change without notice.
