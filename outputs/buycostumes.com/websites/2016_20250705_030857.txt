star wars character bios rey rey is a human character first introduced in star wars: the force awakens. she is a self-sufficient scavenger who lives at a ship graveyard on the desert planet jakku. rey is tough, independent and prefers her solitude, although she does not shy away from helping others. rey is also skilled at riding a speeder and is trained in hand-to-hand combat. you can look just like rey with her signature tan clothing, leather belt, boots and staff. kylo ren kylo ren is the main villain in star wars: the force awakens. he was born shortly after the battle of endor and chose to follow the dark side of the force. he is a member of the knights of ren, which led him to take on the surname of ren. he is also an ally of the first order and works with their leader snoke. kylo is known for wearing a dark hood, cloak, and a mask. he carries a unique, red light saber he built himself which resembles a broadsword with a crossguard. finn finn served as a stormtrooper with the first order for a period of time in star wars: the force awakens, during which he wore the standard white armor of a stormtrooper. finn is sensitive to the force and is able to use a lightsaber. you can look like finn with a white stormtrooper costume or with his more recognizable, casual outfit of a brown jacket, black shirt, and black pants. captain phasma phasma is a captain serving in the first order in the movie star wars: the force awakens, which takes place approximately 30 years after the battle of endor. captain phasma wears a chrome-colored suit similar to stormtrooper armor along with a black and red cape, which are the colors of the first order. phasma is skilled in hand-to-hand combat as well with a blaster gun. star wars: the force awakens flametrooper flametroopers are a special type of soldier in the first order, first shown in star wars: the force awakens. flametroopers use incendiary weapons are wear white armor, similar to stormtroopers, but modified most noticeably with the helmet to protect them from the heat of their weapons. flametroopers fight in combat with an incendiary weapon and backpack that holds fuel for the flame. star wars: the force awakens stormtrooper stormtroopers shown in star wars: the force awakens are members of the first order, whereas the classic stormtroopers from earlier star wars movies were member of the galactic empire. star wars: the force awakens takes place about 30 years after the battle of endor so stormtrooper uniforms received some minor upgrades since then, such as a redesigned chestplate, knee armor, mask and other subtle updates. "fear is the path to the dark side."- anakin skywalker anakin skywalker become the powerful and compassionate anakin skywalker for your next bash. discovered as a slave on tatooine by qui-gon jinn and obi-wan kenobi, anakin skywalker has the potential to become one of the most powerful jedi ever. believed by some to be the prophesied chosen one, he brings hope that balance to the force is possible. "heâ€™s no good to me dead."- boba fett boba fett itâ€™s always fun to play the antagonist and boba fett is one of the best! the only unaltered clone of the famed jango fett he was designed to become part of the grand army of the republic. if you have a bounty on your head, watch out, bobaâ€™s got your number! "aaaaaaaarrgh!"- chewbacca chewbacca fiercely loyal to han solo, chewbacca belongs to the wookiee species. a tall, hirsute biped native to the planet of kashyyyk, he serves as co-pilot on solo's millennium falcon. george lucas was inspired to create â€œchewieâ€? after seeing his own dog sitting in the passenger seat of his car. "fear is my ally."- darth maul darth maul playing evil is always mischievously fun! darth maul was a zabrak sith lord during the naboo crisis. he was taken at an early age to be trained in the ways of the dark side of the force. his first mission: destroy the criminal organization black sun. maul carried out this task perfectly. "i find your lack of faith disturbing."- darth vader darth vader how dark can you go? once a heroic jedi knight, darth vader was seduced by the dark side of the force. upon becoming a sith lord, he led the empireâ€™s eradication of the jedi order. for decades, he enforced his masterâ€™s will and sought to crush the fledgling rebel alliance. but wait, there was still good in himâ€¦ "never tell me the odds."- han solo han solo quick-witted, smuggler, scoundrel and sexy hero, han solo, captain of the millennium falcon, was one of the great leaders of the rebel alliance. believing in the cause of galactic freedom, he joined luke skywalker and princess leia in the fight against the empire. sound like someone you want to play? "iâ€™m luke skywalker, iâ€™m here to rescue you."- luke skywalker luke skywalker think of yourself as â€œforce sensitiveâ€? and a jedi master? hereâ€™s your chance to play it out. a celebrated pilot and leader, skywalker was most famous for destroying the first death star and prompting darth vader to kill emperor palpatine, which led to the eventual downfall of the galactic empire. "why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!"- princess leia princess leia known for having a soft spot for scoundrels; can you say han solo? princess leia ranks among the galaxyâ€™s great heroines. theirs is a love story that went on for years in that galaxy far, far away! "these arenâ€™t the droids weâ€™re looking for."- stormtrooper classic stormtrooper faceless enforcers of the new order, stormtroopers were the elite soldiers of the galactic empire. like imperial-class star destroyers and tie fighters, stormtroopers served as ever-present reminders of the absolute power of emperor palpatine. line up and march, to your next party that is! "you must unlearn what you have learned."- yoda yoda rise to the occasion. small in size but wise and powerful, yoda was a legendary jedi master and stronger than most in his connection with the force. he trained jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the clone wars, the instruction of luke skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality. star wars rebels group costumes who says rebels donâ€™t have a cause? these kids sure do and theyâ€™re happy to have you join the fun. get into character playing ezra, a con artist with crazy-fast reflexes (he sees things a few seconds before they happen) who fights for a greater good. try the inquisitor on for size, as heâ€™s been tasked by darth vader to hunt down the remaining jedi knights. bring kanan to life, too; heâ€™s a jedi survivor of order 66 and has been underground for years evading the empire. sabine loves tagging her work with graffiti and is known for her work in explosives. last but certainly not least is chopper, a grumpy droid who enjoys pranking all the heroes while keeping the ship running! star wars group costume ideas luke & darth vader a celebrated pilot and leader, luke skywalker was most famous for destroying the first death star and prompting darth vader to kill emperor palpatine. and of course weâ€™re all familiar with the famous line, â€œi am your father,â€? which leaves us all speechless every time! princess leia & han solo known for having a soft spot for scoundrels; can you say han solo? princess leia ranks among the galaxyâ€™s great heroines. theirs is a love story that went on for years in that galaxy far, far away! obi-wan kenobi & kid anakin let the force become you. a legendary jedi master, obi-wan kenobi was a noble man gifted in the ways of the force. he trained anakin and guided luke skywalker as a mentor. are you that man?
