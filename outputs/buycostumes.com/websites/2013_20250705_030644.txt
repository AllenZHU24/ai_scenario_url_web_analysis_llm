wear: before you wear your new character mask for the first time, try it on for correct fit. if the mask fits loosely, adding tissue or foam inside of the mask may bring the eye holes closer to your face, improving vision and perfecting your look. if mask shows creases or folds, remove it from the packaging and form over crumpled papers or cloth to aid in retaining its original form. your mask should be looking great and ready to go in no time! care & cleaning: after wearing, a damp cloth may be used to clean your mask. using water only, gently wipe down desired areas inside and out. once the mask is completely dry, lightly dust the inside with unscented talcum powder. this will absorb moisture, aid in keeping your mask fresh and help preserve it for future use. if your mask features attached hair, you can keep it groomed by gently brushing it, layer by layer, with a dog brush. some hair may pull out with each brushing, but careful, gentle brushing will minimize hair loss. storage: to maintain your mask’s realistic look and shape, fill it with clean, crumpled paper. cover your mask with a plastic bag and place it inside its box. avoid displaying or storing your mask in bright light, excessive heat or near ozone-producing air cleaners. extended exposure to harsh elements may significantly reduce the longevity of your mask, but with proper care, your mask can bring you many years of enjoyment. health and safety concerns: please keep safety at the forefront of your mind while wearing your mask, as it can somewhat reduce hearing and visibility. do not wear your mask while driving, sleeping, swimming, crossing streets or using stairs. never smoke while wearing a mask or wear in the presence of an open flame. wearer assumes all risk and responsibility. not recommended for use by children under 10 years old. caution: if your mask contains latex, please note that this material has been known to cause allergic reactions. if you experience any discomfort or a rash appears, discontinue use. if rash continues to develop, please consult your physician. about about us advertise with us 100% price guarantee dropship/wholesale program affiliate program dmca notice press room careers terms of use sitemap customer care contact us email us faqs returns shipping international shipping shopping order status security & privacy costume resources halloween how-to videos blog wig wear & care mask wear & care halloween costumes 2012 halloween costumes 2013 halloween costumes 2014 buycostumes coupons and deals switch to mobile site stay connected friend us on facebook twitter youtube google plus pinterest need assistance? 1-800-459-2969 hours (cst): 9am-9pm mon-fri, 9am-6pm sat bbbonline.org bizrate.com certified customer shop by theme a nightmare on elm street costumes alien & astronaut costumes anime costumes bug costumes cheerleader costumes cosplay costumes devil & demon costumes doctor & nurse costumes dreamgirl costumes elvis presley costumes firefighter costumes friday the 13th costumes ghostbusters costumes gi joe costumes grease costumes kiss costumes lady gaga costumes leg avenue costumes m & m costumes marilyn monroe costumes michael jackson costumes monster & ghost costumes mortal kombat costumes pac-man costumes peter pan costumes police costumes rave wear costumes religious & biblical costumes role play costumes school girl costumes scooby-doo costumes sesame street costumes shrek costumes steampunk costumes the flintstones costumes the incredible hulk costumes the lord of the rings costumes the muppets costumes villain costumes warrior costumes western costumes winnie the pooh costumes copyright © 2014 buycostumes.com all rights reserved. bcweb01
