he first appeared in 1938, while younger fans know him as the action star of their favorite movies and video games. whether his tales unfold on the printed page or the television screen, batman is gotham’s dark knight. he is a protector who stands between the good people of gotham city and those who threaten it daily. the joker, penguin, bane, catwoman, poison ivy, harley quinn, two-face and the riddler – all have hatched schemes that would conquer gotham 100 times over if not for the heroics of its caped crusader. if not for the batman. batman character bios “i’m whatever gotham needs me to be.”- batman dark knight rises black is the new blue when it comes to batman. while in the comics he is portrayed as wearing a blue cape and gray body armor, he dons a darker look when stepping onto the silver screen. thieves and villains better beware, because there’s no telling in which shadow batman may be lurking. “sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.”- batman classic batman bam! pow! crack! zap! those sound effects from the old television show are as classic as the flowing blue cape and yellow utility belt of batman’s bygone era. if you prefer your batman apparel a little old school, this look is for you. “no one cared who i was… until i put on the mask.”- bane bane no one wants to be a vengeful sociopath with a flair for the theatrical, but it sure is fun to play one on tv. so if you’re looking for a villainous look, you can’t beat bane. this costume includes the jumpsuit you need to create fearsome muscles and, of course, bane’s distinctive mask. the accent is up to you. “men always do things the hard way.”- batgirl batgirl when it comes to fighting crime, who says boys get to have all the fun? track down some thieves of your own in this 1966 grand heritage batgirl costume. some may not recognize you immediately, but they will never forget you afterward. “you're catnip to a girl like me. handsome, dazed, and to die for.”- catwoman catwoman she’s a heroine, she’s a villain. she’s an adversary, she’s a love interest. she’s catwoman, and nobody embodies a love-hate relationship with batman better than she does. nine lives and a thousand different motivations all come together to create this signature look. so gear up today and pick your side later. “i have questions. you will answer them. or else.”- batman batman dog add some bark to the batman with this pet costume that'll turn any canine into the caped crusader. comfortable-fitting chest piece, cape and headpiece are available in three different sizes, ensuring pooches of any shape can become the batman. “why so serious?”- joker joker the joke’s on everyone else when the clown prince of crime appears on stage. batman’s greatest adversary is always ready for a few laughs at the expense of gotham’s innocent—and even his own henchmen. so put a smile on that face, grab your purple coat and head on out, because the laughs are just about to begin. “you’ve tripped on one of your own tricks this time joker.”- robin robin turn your child into the boy wonder, robin himself, with this look from buycostumes. from the black mask and the yellow cape to the red suit and the unforgettable r, everything you need to join batman on his next adventure is here with this amazing costume. batman villain group costumes it’s the stuff of nightmares for the people of gotham city
