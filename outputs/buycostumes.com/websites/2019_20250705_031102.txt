which character will the force lead you to become? anakin skywalkerbecome the powerful and compassionate anakin skywalker for your next bash. discovered as a slave on tatooine by qui-gon jinn and obi-wan kenobi, anakin skywalker has the potential to become one of the most powerful jedi ever. believed by some to be the prophesied chosen one, he brings hope that balance to the force is possible. "fear is the path to the dark side." boba fett it’s always fun to play the antagonist and boba fett is one of the best! the only unaltered clone of the famed jango fett he was designed to become part of the grand army of the republic. if you have a bounty on your head, watch out, boba’s got your number! "he’s no good to me dead." chewbaccafiercely loyal to han solo, chewbacca belongs to the wookiee species. a tall, hirsute biped native to the planet of kashyyyk, he serves as co-pilot on solo's millennium falcon. george lucas was inspired to create “chewie” after seeing his own dog sitting in the passenger seat of his car. "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!" darth maulplaying evil is always mischievously fun! darth maul was a zabrak sith lord during the naboo crisis. he was taken at an early age to be trained in the ways of the dark side of the force. his first mission: destroy the criminal organization black sun. maul carried out this task perfectly. "fear is my ally." darth vaderhow dark can you go? once a heroic jedi knight, darth vader was seduced by the dark side of the force. upon becoming a sith lord, he led the empire’s eradication of the jedi order. for decades, he enforced his master’s will and sought to crush the fledgling rebel alliance. but wait, there was still good in him… "i find your lack of faith disturbing." han soloquick-witted, smuggler, scoundrel and sexy hero, han solo, captain of the millennium falcon, was one of the great leaders of the rebel alliance. believing in the cause of galactic freedom, he joined luke skywalker and princess leia in the fight against the empire. sound like someone you want to play? "never tell me the odds." luke skywalkerthink of yourself as “force sensitive” and a jedi master? here’s your chance to play it out. a celebrated pilot and leader, skywalker was most famous for destroying the first death star and prompting darth vader to kill emperor palpatine, which led to the eventual downfall of the galactic empire. "i’m luke skywalker, i’m here to rescue you." princess leiaone of the rebel alliance’s greatest leaders, princess leia organa, sister of luke skywalker, is fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the tyranny of the empire. she also has a soft spot for scoundrels; can you say han solo? leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroines! "why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!" stormtrooper faceless enforcers of the new order, stormtroopers were the elite soldiers of the galactic empire. like imperial-class star destroyers and tie fighters, stormtroopers served as ever-present reminders of the absolute power of emperor palpatine. line up and march, to your next party that is! "these aren’t the droids we’re looking for." yodarise to the occasion. small in size but wise and powerful, yoda was a legendary jedi master and stronger than most in his connection with the force. he trained jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the clone wars, the instruction of luke skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality. "you must unlearn what you have learned." star wars group costume ideaswho says rebels don’t have a cause? these kids sure do and they’re happy to have you join the fun. get into character playing ezra, a con artist with crazy-fast reflexes (he sees things a few seconds before they happen) who fights for a greater good. try the inquisitor on for size, as he’s been tasked by darth vader to hunt down the remaining jedi knights. bring kanan to life, too; he’s a jedi survivor of order 66 and has been underground for years evading the empire. sabine loves tagging her work with graffiti and is known for her work in explosives. last but certainly not least is chopper, a grumpy droid who enjoys pranking all the heroes while keeping the ship running! friends & couples costume ideas luke skywalker and darth vadera celebrated pilot and leader, like skywalker was most famous for destroying the first death star and prompting darth vader to kill emperor palpatine. and of course we’re all familiar with the famous line, “i am your father,” which leaves us all speechless every time! princess leia and han soloknown for having a soft spot for scoundrels; can you say han solo? princess leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroines. theirs is a love story that went on for years in that galaxy far, far away! obi-wan and kids' anakinlet the force become you. a legendary jedi master, obi-wan kenobi was a noble man gifted in the ways of the force. he trained anakin and guided luke skywalker as a mentor. are you that man? female stormtrooper and dog costumeshow up as these two and you’re sure to create a galactic storm. dewbacks are known for being capable of brief bursts of surprising speeds when prodded by their riders or, in this case, human companion – i mean stormtrooper! enhance your star wars costume style ultimate adult costume stormtrooper benefitsit’s all in the details and this version of the original look makes our stormtrooper supreme edition adult costume a superior selection when it comes to iconic costume design. regardless of what side of the force you’re on, the appeal of this iconic space soldier's look is undeniable. legions of bad guys wore the armor in the original series and a couple of good guys used it as a disguise as well. the black jumpsuit features button details molded on the chest, molded armor pieces on the legs, arms, torso, back and lower back. the costume also features a belt at the waist, a codpiece, shoulder, bicep, shin, knee and thigh pieces all of molded plastic. the authentic helmet and black gloves put the finishing touches on a costume you’ll get light years of mileage from! jedi robe costume and accessoriesinspired by the star wars universe, our jedi robe costume puts you in the mood to feel, look and act like a jedi master! mirroring their attachment-free philosophy, as well as showing their requirement to live almost devoid of luxury, this costume showcases the jedi’s devotion to service. the simple design allows great freedom of movement and features an oversized hood and sleeves. add any of our lightsabers, a jedi braid and the black boots, and the force will surely be with you wherever your journey takes you! jedi vs sith jediput your dueling skills to the test. you must make a choice, sith or jedi? play a sith and you’re actually permitted to use the force offensively. play a jedi and you cannot use the force offensively. with that being the case, how would you survive and defend the galaxy against the sith lords? superior dueling skills of course! sithput your dueling skills to the test. you must make a choice, sith or jedi? play a sith and you’re actually permitted to use the force offensively. play a jedi and you cannot use the force offensively. with that being the case, how would you survive and defend the galaxy against the sith lords? superior dueling skills of course! top of page be in the know! sign up for our news letter for exclusive offers sign up stay connected visit us on facebook follow us on twitter follow us on pinterest see us on youtube see us on instagram +1 on google+ about us 2019 halloween costumescompany informationcostume ideas blog contact us customer service returns & refund policy shipping policyprivacy policymy account customer support 605-271-2608 track your order email us copyright © 2020 buycostumes.com all rights reserved. top of page
