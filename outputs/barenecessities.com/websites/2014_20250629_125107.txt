(this is one "32" band i won't have to alter smaller via sewing, yay!) i really love the fit and shape of this bra, though, and the solid construction and support. super pretty with the lace, too; though i kind of wish the cups underneath the lace were the same color as the lace (like the chantelle c graphique t-shirt bra), instead of being white; i have the feeling this bra might show through under thin/sheer fabric for that reason. click to order this style​​ fantasie fl2024 rebecca t-shirt bra $74.00 more fantasie: rebecca t-shirt bra 102 reviews colors: details: lightweight, breathable spacer t-shirt bra u.k. cup sizes. see size chart for u.s. conversion. seamless, foam-lined underwire cups for a natural look back adjustable, close-set, stretch straps won't slip 3 column, 2 row hook and eye back closure featured review: on november 1, 2014 my favourite bra i love this bra. i already had 3 others, so i knew my size, i just wanted them in every colour thy have. they are supportive, look great, give me a fabulous shape and some cleavage!

generally, i am a 32dd, and i am a 32i in this bra (i am 7 mo pregnant). i feel that this bra is comfortable and supportive. even with my bust being so large, i would feel comfortable wearing it in public. i originally ordered it in nude, but i have since ordered it in black as well. this bra is definitely not "sexy" but i think it is supportive, comfortable and functional. the material feels really good on my skin. i definitely recommend this bra!

i love that it has only two hooks...most bras for larger busted women tend to have three or four. as a woman with a very short torso and large bosom, i can't use the bras with more hooks because the bra will tend to poke into my armpits...a most uncomfortable feeling. i'd love to see this bra in more colors too. click to order this style​​ chantelle 2031 hedona molded bra $68.00 more chantelle: hedona molded bra 35 reviews colors: details: seamless, unlined molded underwire minimizer bra european cup sizes. see size chart for u.s. conversion. gives a minimizing effect of one cup size smaller side boning for additional support back adjustable, close-set, stretch straps won't slip featured review: on october 10, 2014 feels great. comfortable. pretty. lace is soft. fits true to size including the cup. comes in my hard-to-find size of 32g. supports very well; no sagging or bouncing. straps are comfortable. the closure is a lovely double hook/eye, instead of the usual industrial 3- or 4-hook closure. minimizes a smidge little less than a full size. however, it's enough to make one feel and appear "normal," not like she's carrying giant sacks of sand. i'll be ordering more. click to order this style​​ le mystère ln9955 dream tisha t-shirt bra $69.00 more le mystère: dream tisha t-shirt bra 193 reviews colors: details: seamless underwire t-shirt bra with foam-lined cups european cup sizes. see size chart for u.s. conversion. higher wings & side boning provide added support u-back design prevents straps from slipping back adjustable stretch straps featured review: on july 28, 2014 a great product!
