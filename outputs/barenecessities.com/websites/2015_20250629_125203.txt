bra for the price i'm a 36 gg - so i'm pretty tough to get 5 stars from. this bra has nice shape (not pointy) and has enough padding to hide the fact that you're cold without bulking you up. i'd love more support (my main issue with all bras)such that the sides of my breasts were in line with my frame. this bra is comfortable, though the lace along the edge under your breasts may scratch some if there is pressure on the band there (as there always is for me). click to order this style​​ × wacoal 857210 visual effects minimizer bra $65.00 more hidden button wacoal: visual effects minimizer bra

buying this bra. i was surprised at how transparent it is, since you can't see the model's nipples at all. i thought it was padded, but nope it's a very thin bra. super comfortable so i didn't return

mirror your natural shape in mesh-lined molded cups fully adjustable, close-set, stretch straps won’t slip 3 column, 2 row hook and eye back closure featured review: on april 15, 2015 loyal daytime bra for many years i thought i was a 34d for a long time before a proper fitting at a department store about 10 years ago "diagnosed" me with a 32dd. i bought 2 "minimizers" as a result of that visit, yet found the freya rio online. i like it so much better than a minimizer, because it does not push the breasts off the torso and -without padding!- guides them into a natural and supported shape. bare necessities always has this in stock, and i am so glad it is offered in a nude color too after a hiatus. i can buy dresses in my real size and less often have to buy a size up and tailor the waist and hips. click to order this style​​ × spanx 216 bra-llelujah front-close t-shirt bra $62.00 more hidden button spanx: bra-llelujah front-close t-shirt bra 63 reviews colors: details: prevent

my clothes. i finally found that bra with the spanx product line. i was skeptical at first. when my bra arrived and i tried it on and used it for a couple of days i was hooked. this bra is everything

row, single hook adjustments; converts to criss-cross featured review: on december 22, 2015 amazing this is the best bra in the world for me. i was a little nervous when i opened the package and saw that the cups were soft and not firm/molded into shape. once i tried it on i was sold. i wear a size 32h and i am very petite but having such large breasts makes me feel fat as its hard to see past them. this bra was extremely supportive and my natural shape looks lovely. in a shirt they look so much smaller and i feel so much more confident and don't just see boobs when i look in the mirror. with the underwire on the outside nothing is stabbing my in the ribs and the material is so soft. love it. want to buy more in other colors. click to order this style​​ × wacoal 85567 awareness

fit!! after ordering almost every t-shirt bra on this site in my irregular size (32ff), this is the winner!! the cups actually add shape, putting my breasts out front. in every other bra i still had that little bump above the cup line- even after going up two cup sizes. the cups felt strange at first- hard to describe but the fabric or shape is somehow different, it fells like i had extra room inside but i don't. i feel like the cup could be 1/2 a size smaller to be perfect, but i'm not complaining because the bump is gone and looks beautiful. i put on a thin t-shirt and my husband immediately said- that's the one- the bump and line are gone! finally a bra that feels sexy, supportive, and looks amazing. thanks bare necessities! click to order this style​​ × freya aa4892 active

supportive, full coverage underwire t-shirt bra european cup sizes. see size chart for u.s. conversion. new, innovative cup technology called 'space mousse' great shape in breathable spacer and memory foam cups crush resistant cups make this bra perfect for travel featured review: on november 24, 2015 finally a bra i love! i ordered this bra because i have a few other pieces from chantelle. i was worried the fit would be too small since i normally have trouble finding my size in their assortment. i recently got a uniform at work with a button down top ( my worst enemy!) so figured i'de try this. i'm 160 pounds, 5'5. i would have to say it's something i can wear 15 hrs and be totally comfortable. i also have worn it everyday since i got it. it keeps a natural shape and gives excellent support for a smaller frame compared to chest. the only bummer is that the hook and eye closure is pulling, not reinforced as well as i would like, but willing to overlook because it's ideal for work, t shirts, dresses. i never have to adjust the straps while i am wearing it, which i have trouble with lately on other bras. click to order this style​​ × panache 3251 tango balconette bra

featured review: on october 28, 2015 a good bra my favorite bra was discontinued, so i tried this one. i was pleased enough to purchase two more a few months later. the support is good, and it didn't add a lot of bulk. shaping is pretty realistic. my issues with it are simple -for a t-shirt bra, there were some poor design choices. the bows where the straps and cups meet show under clothes. similarly, the lace at the sides of the cups shows under tighter t-shirts. also, since it's not fully tacked on, it has a tendency to bunch up under my arms. click to order this style​​ × elomi el4030

perfect sports bra for hard to fit, large busted women! i went to order a sports bra style that i have worn for years, but sadly found out it had been discontinued. i wear a 30f, and it is extremely difficult to find any bra to fit me, yet alone a sports bra with a criss-cross in the back. i ordered 5 different styles from bare necessities and the first 4 styles i tried on did not work. when i tried this chantelle sports bra on it fit like a glove. not only is it supportive and comfortable, but it is beyond easy to put on in the criss-cross version! my old sports bra that has been discontinued was impossible to get on. i read the reviews that said to order a band size up and a cup size down and i do not agree at all. i wear a 30f in my daily fantasie t-shirt bra, and i wear a 30f in this chantelle sports bra. i will be ordering several more for my high impact workouts. click to order this style​​ × anita 5490 maximum comfort seamless bra $69.00 more hidden button anita:
