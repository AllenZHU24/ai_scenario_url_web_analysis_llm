be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the internet or by other remote means. many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities. vermont and kentucky require the tax not collected by bare necessities on taxable purchases shipped to vermont or kentucky, respectively, be reported by the purchaser. the use tax forms and instructions are available on the vermont department of taxes website and on the kentucky department of revenue website. back to top are my items in
