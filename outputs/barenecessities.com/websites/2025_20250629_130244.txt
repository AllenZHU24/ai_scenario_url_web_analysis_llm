pretty package. how do we pull off such alchemy? start your search for a bra that fits like a dream; our bra size calculator, which teaches you how to measure for your bra size and plug your measurements into our calculator; or our shop by bra size experience, which allows you to shop our entire site based on your band and cup size. lastly, look for fit notes on some of our best sellers

best-fitting bra in the world doesn’t count for much if you don’t like the way it looks or it doesn’t make sense in your life. once you’ve got your current bra size and go-to brands sorted, focus on the styles that work wonders on your body and natural curves. how much coverage do you prefer your cups give? for everyday wear with a side of support, look to full-cup or t-shirt bras. a demi-cup bra (a.k.a. a balcony or balconette bra) covers a little less. a push-up bra, plunge bra or sexy cage bra shows the most skin. looking for more versatility? check out these bras styles—a racerback bra, convertible bra, t-back bra, strapless bra or bandeau—dispense with or change up the adjustable straps to make getting dressed a snap. others solve common concerns, like an easy-wearing front-closure bra, or a lined or padded bra for a measure of modesty. not really in the mood for much of anything? consider a bralette or wire-free lounge bra. on the other end of the spectrum is the sports bra, ideal for high impact movement, and the structured bra, which comes with boning, like a bustier or corset. say goodbye to unnecessary discomfort with full-busted bras designed specifically for dd+ cup sizes, full-figure plus size bras, side-support bras to bring you in and up, and minimizer bras that make you look less busty while still providing that extra support. nursing and maternity bras step up when functionality and fit matter arguably more than ever. this isn’t even the half of it. if you need it, it probably exists—and we can help you find it. looking for the best bras for small breasts? how about the best bras for senior women? or check out our guide to every type of bra we offer. if you're wondering how long bras last, read our guide on when to replace your bras. even

in order to find the perfect style and shape, it’s useful to be able to speak bra, a fashion staple that figures into your every day. need-to-know components come down to: the band, the cups, the straps and the center gore (the piece of fabric that connects the cups). anything beyond that comes down to personal preference. underwire vs. wire-free: some bras have u-shaped wires embedded below the cups for extra lift and support but these days, design advances in wire-free bra styles come pretty close—even for fuller cup sizes. unlined vs. padded: for an au natural feel, turn to multipart seamed or seamless mesh bras. if you prefer a little more coverage for modesty or fullness, you’ll want lightly lined or padded cups. front-close vs. back-close: choose a front-close style for the easiest possible on and off; consider a bra that fastens in back for added adjustability over time. back-smoothing vs. backless: is the way your back looks at the front of your mind when bra shopping? then you’ll want to hone in on a back-smoother with a wide, shaping band, or a backless bra (no band, no bumps or lumps, no problem). shoulder straps: a bra's straps (which actually shouldn’t be doing much heavy lifting compared to the band) can be fixed in place, removable (voilà, instant strapless bra!) or convertible to turn them into, say, a racerback. fabrics: like other garments that are expected to really perform, keep an eye out for fabrics that offer a little something extra, such as moisture-wicking cotton or stretch lace that conforms to your figure, even if your breasts aren’t exactly the same size. best bra brands because there are countless bra brands out there, it can be overwhelming to know which are right for you personally. start with our curated assortment of over 80
