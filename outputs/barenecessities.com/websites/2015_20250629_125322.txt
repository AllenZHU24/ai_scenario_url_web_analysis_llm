jezebel: muse satin chemise 3 reviews colors: details: look and feel sexy in this lace plunge satin chemise modesty coverage thanks to contrast lining over bust 26'' long from shoulders; measured from size m stunning open back with adjustable straps satin finish polyester and stretch lace featured review: on june 10, 2015 boyfriend approved i usually have issues with adjustable straps on chemises because my boob size doesn't match the rest of my body, and this chemise is no exception (i had to pin it to get the perky boob look i was going for). however, the large accommodated my 34dd chest just fine, and the material feels nice. the lace is a little scratchy, so i doubt i'd sleep in this, but let's be real - i didn't buy it to sleep in it anyways. i would recommend this. i'm a short person, and this chemise was still pretty short on me, so consider yourself warned tall people. click to order this style​​ × calvin klein qs5345 depth knit pajama pants $58.00 more hidden button
