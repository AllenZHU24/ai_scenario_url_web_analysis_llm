biker-short styled, normal waisted spanx. these are closer to being back to the original, but still not quite there. maybe i'm just looking for more squeeze, but i would definitely order these one size down next time (i am admittedly kind of right on the line between sizes and opted up this time...). just didn't feel they smoothed out the bumps and rolls as well as the original. still did a decent job, though, and definitely do fine protecting the inner thigh "chub rub" areas. click to order this styleâ€‹â€‹ × cosabella never0521 never say never tootsie low rise bikini $34.00 more hidden

roll up sometimes, (which is why i gave them 4 stars) but not too bad. these cover my bottom completely instead of coming up the back like some other boyshorts i bought do. i bought a size 7 and they are a little snug, but they do have the stretch in them, so they don't bind at all. click to order this styleâ€‹â€‹ × hanky panky 4811 signature lace original rise thong $13.99-$20.00 must-have thong

comfortable, good quality cotton. the sizing and coverage bar is not working. i would sizes it as it fits small so buy a size or two bigger but good and comfortable coverage. i would definitely buy again. very hard to find 100% cotton underwear. also i like that i can choose my colors. i hate different colors of underwear so it's a bonus for me to have the same color and the color i want. the only negative is when i returned my first order because it was too small i never got a notice of a refund so i have no idea if i got my money back i need to call the company to check bummer! they also charge you to return the item even if it's just an exchange. and one more thing they have a glitch in the system with cost beware. click to order this styleâ€‹â€‹ × warner's rt2091p no pinching. no

ordered a medium. the fit is not tight at all even after washing and drying. the waist does come up higher, which may show at the top of jeans, but this is is far preferable to the low rise panties
