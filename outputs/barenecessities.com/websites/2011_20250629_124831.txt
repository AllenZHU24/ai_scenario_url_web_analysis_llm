" - karen j. march 26, 2011 "this site is excellent for bra fitting. i haven't shopped it but i probably will and will keep you posted as to how the fit and service goes. i fit bras for over a year at a department store and it was fun helping the majority of women find the right fit but for women with and band size over 44 and beyond ddd it's impossible in a store so this is an exciting site. you will be surprised that your cup is actually an f but donât let that stop you. a good fitting bra is important to health and happiness." - moneic w. february 18, 2011 "i just received my order, tried on all 5 bras that i purchased and just have to give you a very personal thanks. seriously, that's all i am contacting you for. we get so caught up in the negative and are quick to complain when we're unhappy, i thought i'd do the opposite. these are the most beautiful bras and fit so perfectly that i had to say thank you,thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time. expensive but very much worth it. i can't stand the padded bras and thought i would never find such pretty lace ones like these. thanks and you have a new customer for life." - dawn q. february 12, 2011"i would just like to tell you that i was very happy with my online purchase. i would puchase through your web site agin in the future. i am very glad that as a canadian that we can purchase through your company. thanks once again for the great service." - susan s. february 11, 2011 "i wanted to say thank you for your store. i have never been able buy bathing suits that fit my chest...or should i say find bathing suits that fit my chest. i am a big girl (about size 14) but my chest is 38gg...so if it fit my chest, it didnât fit the body and if it fit the body it didnât fit the "girls". i just received my first suit from your company today. it fits perfectly. i loved that it came in my bra size. it has changed my entire confidence level and will allow me to go out to the beach when we are in the bahamas next week and get in the water or do the water sports, as opposed to just laying on the beach as i usually am forced to do. you just cant do those things when you are afraid you are going to fall out of your suit, ya know? so thank you thank you. i will be buying more today! have a blessed day!" - gina s. february 11, 2011 "you have been great! you even took back an old order at full value and everything was so prompt. i will always shop here first and i will tell all my friends. thank you for a wonderful shopping experience." - charlotte b.february 3, 2011 "everything is perfect, exactly what i ordered , and it arrived really fast. thank you so much." -kate r.january 13, 2011 "i've recommended bare necessities, my favorite under garment store to all my co-workers, friends and friends of friends; and everyone has rated bn as #1. excellent customer service is my # 1 reason. also, i can always find whatever i'm looking for. nothing beats bn!!!" -jennifer e.january 6, 2011"i find that shopping with bare necessities is very comforting, knowing that they do their best to sell quality items. the shipping charges are great as well. i will keep doing business with them. thank you bare necessities for being here" -helen c.december 29, 2010 "i just wanted to thank you all for such a wonderful selection of a cup bras. i have been having such a hard time finding sexy bras in my size since i lost a cup size after childbirth/nursing. your bras are beautiful thanks for making this small sized girl feel sexy again."- tammy o.december 3, 2010"thank you for the great service. you do an aaaa job. would recommend your site to anyone. thanks again for a flawless transaction." - linda b. november, 24 2010"excellent, personal customer service. no hassle just help."- lisa k.november 23, 2010"please feel free to use my email...i do alot of on line shopping....and i have never gotten better service than i did from bare necessities....i got exactly what i ordered in record time...i will be doing alot of shopping with you over the holidays..it truly was a pleasure...thank you again...
