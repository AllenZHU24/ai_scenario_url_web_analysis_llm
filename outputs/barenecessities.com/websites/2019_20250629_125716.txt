to top what is my shopper id? your shopper id is e9bf39 not sure what's going on with your bag? call us at 1.877.728.9272 and give a customer service representative your shopper id. a shopper id is a unique id that identifies what is in your shopping bag. we would be happy to help you complete your transaction. back to top will i be charged sales tax on my order? items sold by bare necessities are subject to tax when shipped to destinations in: al, ar, az, ca, co, ct, dc, fl, ga, ia, id, il, in, ks, ky, la, ma, md, me, mi, mn, mo, ms, nc, nd, ne, nj, nm, ny, nv, oh, ok, pa, ri, sc, sd, tn, tx, ut, va, vt, wa, wi, wv and wy. any applicable tax will be applied to the price you pay for taxable items, less any and all extra savings. back to top how do i place a tax exempt order? eligible governmental, non-profit, charitable and similar organizations should email all tax-exempt requests to taxexempt@barenecessities.com. please specify the order number of the bare necessities order for which the exemption is requested and include a copy of applicable state or federal exemption certificates. eligible tax exemptions will be processed by bare necessities and tax will be refunded to the original payment method. bare necessities does not store the tax-exempt status for any organization. please email taxexempt@barenecessities.com for each order placed on barenecessities.com. bare necessities does not honor resale exemption certificates, as purchases for resale are against the bare necessities terms of use. back to top are my items in stock? we offer real-time inventory. you can check if any item is available on each product page by selecting the size and color you need. if the color/size combination is no longer available, a message will show up in red stating "this color/size combination is no longer available." back to top how do backorders work? if the size/color you need is on backorder, a message will show up underneath the add to bag button stating ships 2-3 weeks or ships 6-8 weeks. you can still place an order for these items, and we recommend doing so to save your place in line! once we receive your item back in stock, we will ship it out to you for no additional shipping cost! charging for backorders: when you place your order, there will be a pending authorization hold on the total amount of the order; this charge drops a few business days after the purchase. you are not charged for backordered items until they ship. once we receive the items in stock, we will ship them out to you via our standard shipping method (5-7 business days) at no additional charge. when the items ship, you will be charged for the merchandise and any applicable tax. if backorders are discounted: sometimes your backordered items will get broken up into separate shipments based on availability. if the items carry a discount or promotion, the last items that ship will carry the discount or "free" status. for example, say you take advantage of a buy 2 get 1 free promotion and order 9 pairs of maidenform comfort devotion hipsters that are backordered 2-3 weeks. we may receive a partial shipment and send you 6 pairs. you would be charged for the 6 pairs as they ship. the following week, we may receive another shipment from the vendor, then those 3 will ship out to you free of charge and free of any shipping charges since the final items to ship always carry the discount. back to top when can i use apple pay? we accept apple pay on compatible devices on u.s. orders. apple pay cannot be used to purchase gift certificates, to place orders requiring gift receipts or to place orders shipped to apo/fpo addresses. orders purchased using apple pay cannot redeem gift certificates, vouchers or store credit. back to top when can i use visa
