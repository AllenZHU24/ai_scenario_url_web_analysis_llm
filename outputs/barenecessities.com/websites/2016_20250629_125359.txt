flattering i was looking for a pair of blag everyday pants to replace my soybu pants that are similar, which i've worn nearly everyday in the winter for 4 years. these almost do it, but they are slightly long. i'm 5'8" and wear about a 32" inseam. they are fine with a boot with a small heel but too long to kick on flats for wearing all day.a little too much flare and length. but, they do the job in the butt and waist area. click to order this style​​ × yummie by heather thomson ya2-007 milan active cotton shaping leggings $76.00 extra 25% off today more hidden button yummie by heather

details: look stylish in these yoga leggings signature logo tag on back and no pockets 27'' inseam; measurement taken from size s perfect for barre and studio comfortable stretch cotton featured review: on october 26, 2016 first hard tail purchase i work at home and practically live in leggings - for working out, running errands and being comfortable at my laptop for hours on end. as a result, they start getting worn out and i'm off to find new ones, but i do have some criteria that needs to be fulfilled. some leggings are too tight, some are too long and bunch up at my ankles, some are too see-through, and some are not flattering to the waistline (cutting in at weird places or always rolling down). i've tested out the hard tail leggings in a size small and they mostly met the mark. while they're not my favorite leggings, my softest or most comfortable, they're not see-through, are comfortable enough and are of nice enough quality that they can be dressed up and worn out. overall, a solid all-purpose pair of leggings. for sizing reference: i'm around 5'4", 135ish and have an athletic build with muscular thighs and calves and a bigger than average butt and the small was not cutting off my circulation anywhere! if you're athletic or moderately curvy, these should work for you - they're flattering, no bulges. if you're taller than me, you should be fine in these since they run longer - they do bunch up at the ankle on me. if you're smaller than 5'3" these might not be petite enough. multiple body types could roll with these, but they'd probably be most ideal on someone taller and more slender than i am. click to order this style​​ × spanx 1831 medium control compression leggings $98.00 extra 25% off today more hidden button spanx: medium control compression
