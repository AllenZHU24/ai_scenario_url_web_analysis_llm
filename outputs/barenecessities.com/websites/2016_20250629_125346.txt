now i don't care so much that the straps may show when i wear tank tops playing tennis. i do think the product is too expensive, that's why i wait until there is a sale or a coupon code before i purchase it. click to order this style​​ × wacoal 857210 visual effects minimizer bra $65.00 more hidden button wacoal: visual effects minimizer bra 20 reviews colors: details: reduce your bust up to 1 inch in this minimizer bra natural shape maintained in molded double-layer cups great style if breasts are different sizes end strap slipping with adjustable, close-set straps smooth, engineered lace with sheer mesh lining featured review: on november 14, 2016 it holds them up great support, holds breasts high and separates, attractive fabric, and true to size. only drawback is it's a lot of bra to get these results so i feel like i am wearing my grandma's bra. click to order this style​​ × anita 5527 maximum control wire-free sports bra $47.99-$69.00 more hidden button anita: maximum control wire-free sports bra 189 reviews colors: details: work out in this maximum impact wire-free sports bra built for high-impact activities such as zumba encapsulated cups for support;

i looked at this bra for so long before actually purchasing it. now, after purchasing it and wearing it for several months - i could kick myself for not buying it sooner! this bra is fantastic for anyone who is "well endowed". i am petite (5'3'', 110 lbs), but am a very full 30ddd or 32dd. i ordered this bra in a 32dd, but had to return it for a 32d and it fits perfectly! so keep in mind it does run large. but when you get your correct size, this will be your favorite bra! the back strap sits low on your back (where it should be), therefore completely eliminating any "back fat". the cups are high enough so there is no double boob effect, but not too high for a v-neck shirt or dress. this bra lifts your breasts up where they should be! it gives the illusion of minimizing because it's so supportive (instead of leaving your boobs wide and hanging). also one of my breasts is almost a cup size larger than the other, and this bra somehow hides it perfectly! it's the most comfortable bra i've ever owned, but yet offers the support and good profile us busty girls crave. i am about to buy another, and will never be without one of these bras again! click to order this style​​ × prima donna 016-1811 deauville full cup bra $142.00 more hidden button prima donna: deauville full cup bra 29 reviews colors: details: feel beautiful wearing this gorgeous embroidered lace bra supportive, 3-part molded cup design lifts and maintains shape soft, padded underwire is nickel-free for optimum comfort customized fit thanks to elastic lining at top of cups close-set back adjustable stretch straps featured review: on november 8, 2016 husband loves the look awesome thanks for sharing. and thank you for a perfect fit. click to order this style​​ × fantasie fl2024 rebecca t-shirt bra $50.99-$74.00 more hidden button fantasie: rebecca t-shirt bra 156 reviews colors: details: smooth silhouette achieved in this breathable t-shirt bra prevent show-through with seamless spacer underwire cups spacer fabric gives opacity like foam minus the weight end strap slipping with adjustable, leotard back straps 3 column, 2 row hook and eye back closure featured review: on november 12, 2016 loved i've always struggled finding ones that fit and are comfortable. i usually compromise in more than one way just to have something. with this bra i didn't have to compromise at all. i don't like a lot of padding due to being large chested (there's already too much in that area) but i also don't like nothing. this bra provided a light layer for comfort. i didn't think i was going to like the molding cups especially since its a tad see through however when it's on it isn't see through at all and actually provides the perfect structure and support. also i like the variety and appeal of it. other times for comfort i usually have to get larger straps or more clasps or various other appearance items. with this bra they somehow found a way for it to be super comfortable and supportive and alluring. hopefully they will be making this one for a long time cause it's the only i will be buying from now on!
