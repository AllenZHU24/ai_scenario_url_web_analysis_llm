in your shopping bag. we would be happy to help you complete your transaction. back to top how much tax will i be charged on my order? bare necessities does not collect sales or use taxes. for states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the internet or by other remote means. many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities. vermont and kentucky require the tax not collected by bare necessities on taxable purchases shipped to vermont or kentucky, respectively, be reported by the purchaser. the use tax forms and instructions are available on the vermont department of taxes website and on the kentucky department of revenue website. back to top are my items in stock? we offer real-time inventory. you can check if any item is available on each product page by selecting the size and color you need. if the color/size combination is no longer available, a message will show up in red stating "this color/size combination is no longer available." back to top how do backorders work? if the size/color you need is on backorder, a message will show up underneath the "add to bag" button stating "ships 2-3 weeks" or "ships 6-8 weeks." you can still place an order for these items, and we recommend doing so to save your place in line! once we receive your item back in stock, we will ship it out to you for no additional shipping cost! charging for backorders: when you first place your order, there will be a pending authorization hold on the total amount of the order; this charge drops a few business days after the purchase. you are not charged for backordered items until they ship out. once we receive the items in stock, we will pack them up and ship them out to you via our "free standard shipping" method (6-9 business days). as the items ship, you will be charged. if backorders are discounted: sometimes your backordered items will get broken up into separate shipments based on availability. if the items carry a discount or promotion, the last items that ship will carry the discount or "free" status. for example, say, you take advantage buy 2 get 1 free promotion and you order 9 pairs of maidenform comfort devotion hipsters, but they are backordered for 2-3 weeks. we may receive a partial shipment and send you 6 pairs. you would be charged for the six pairs as they ship. the following week, we may receive another shipment from the vendor, then those 3 will ship out to you free of charge and free of any shipping charges since the final items to ship always carry the discount. back to top when can i use apple pay? we accept apple pay on compatible devices on u.s. orders.
