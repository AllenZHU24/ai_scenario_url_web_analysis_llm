service about us about us design toscano is the country's premier source for statues and other historical and antique replicas, which are available through our catalog and website. we were named in inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing privately-held companies for three consecutive years - an honor unprecedented among catalogers. our founders, michael and marilyn stopka, created design toscano in 1990. while on a trip to paris, the stopkas first saw the marvelous carvings of gargoyles and water spouts at the notre dame cathedral. inspired by the beauty and mystery of these pieces, they decided to introduce the world of medieval gargoyles to america in 1993. on a later trip to albi, france, the stopkas had the pleasure of being exposed to the world of jacquard tapestries that they added quickly to the growing catalog. since then, our product line has grown to include egyptian, medieval and other period pieces that are now among the current favorites of design toscano customers, along with an extensive collection of garden fountains, statuary, authentic canvas replicas of oil painting masterpieces, and other antique art reproductions. at design toscano, we pride ourselves on attention to detail by traveling directly to the source for all historical replicas. over 90% of our catalog offerings are exclusive to the design toscano brand, allowing us to present unusual decorative items unavailable elsewhere. our attention to detail extends throughout the company, especially in the areas of customer service and shipping. click here to view our "president's
