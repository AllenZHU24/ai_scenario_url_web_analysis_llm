excited with this opportunity, we enthusiastically began working on this idea. finally, in july of 1998, we saw our vision become a reality during the launch of our new website – cutleryandmore.com. cookware... bakeware... kitchen tools.. small appliances... and much, much more.we continue to offer the highest quality products for both professionals and at-home cooks at unbeatable prices. not only do we specialize in a wide assortment of brand name products at a great value, but customer service is also of the utmost importance to us. we are known nationwide, as well as internationally, for our prompt shipping, dependable customer service and insurmountable customer satisfaction.thank you for choosing cutlery and more ® as your cutlery and cookware provider – we truly appreciate our customers and it is because of you that we have been able to grow and flourish.sincerely,4th generation ownercutlery and more ® have questions or need assistance?
