cutleryandmore™started in the early 1920's, when the internet was far from existence. our family-owned company began as a direct mobile sharpening service, traveling door-to-door on a weekly route to local cooking professionals in the chicago area. offering up knowledge of cutlery and expertise in knife sharpening around the metro chicago area, our family quickly became known as the knife experts.by word of mouth, our sharpening service quickly began to succeed. by the late 1940's we expanded the business to include our first retail store. in addition to offering one of the best sharpening services in the chicago area, we introduced fine cutlery and kitchen tools to our loyal customer base.by the mid-1970's, with the continuous help from our ever growing customer support, we were able to relocate to a larger store. while continuing to enhance the professional theme, we also began to cater to the "new" at-home professional. we wanted to reach out and share our expertise with culinary enthusiasts who were looking to improve their home cooking with top notch cutlery and kitchen equipment. with the finest cutlery and cookware, along with the continual growing array of kitchen products, our store became a much needed destination not only for professional chefs but discerning home cooks alike.by the late 1990's, our business extended even further with an innovative idea between the fourth generation father and son. at a time when internet usage and the world-wide web were on the rise, we began exploring this new tool and began thinking “what if.”  we wondered what if we could share our experience and knowledge with not only our local customers, but the rest of the world as well? excited with this opportunity, we enthusiastically began working on this idea. finally, in july of 1998, we saw our vision become a reality during the launch of our new website – cutleryandmore.com. cookware... bakeware... kitchen tools.. small appliances... and much, much more.we continue to offer the highest quality products for both professionals and at-home cooks at unbeatable prices. not only do we specialize in a wide assortment of brand name products at a great
