i love it!! the bezel is not as touchy as most people described, there is a sensitivity setting that you can change. i never loose satellite signal. my favorite place to run is covered with trees and there are even tunnels that i run through and i still never drop the satellite. i love running more now than i did before having the watch, i try to beat my own time everyday and i know exactly how far i have gone. i would recommend buying this watch to all runners!share your success storyname/location:testimonial:we respect your privacy.heart rate monitorsheart rate monitors - all modelscategoryby sportgpsaccessorieshealth and wellnessbody fat measurementsports therapyblood pressurefitnesshome health careblood pressureblood pressure monitorsstylecuff sizetypecuffs and accessorieshydration packs/bottlescamelbak hydrationaccessories for camelbakgeigerrig hydrationaccessories for geigerrigdeuter backpacks/hydrationelectrolyte drinkscamelbak bpa-free bottleshydro flask insulated water bottlesavex bpa free water bottlesclearance sale!
