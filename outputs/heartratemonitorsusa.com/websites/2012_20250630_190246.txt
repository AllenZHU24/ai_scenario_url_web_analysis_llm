adding the spice to your exercise varietywahoo fitness products: turn your iphone into a training powerhouse do you have a success story? perhaps using your heart rate monitor has help you achieve certain fitness or weight loss goals. we would appreciate if you could inspire us with your story.i love my ft7 heart rate monitor & calorie counter. i bought it a month ago and use it everyday. i have over 100 pounds to loose, but i'm taking it one step at a time and exercising the right way. i work out 6 days a week now, watch what i eat and have lost 16 lbs last month. i track all my calories during my workout. i prefer my zumba or belly dancing classes, but i am often found on the elliptical or treadmill. my goal is to burn over 600 calories per workout via cardio. the ft7 monitor is very easy to use and has been very accurate. i'm glad i purchased it and it keeps me motivated especially when i want to give up on those last few minutes which really gives the best burn. it's great to program my new (lesser) weight each week to keep my monitor accurate.thanks for helping me on my journey and look forward to many more years of use with this fine product. share your success storyname/location:testimonial:we respect your privacy.heart rate monitorsheart rate monitors -
