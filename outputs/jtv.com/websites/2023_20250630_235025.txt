rewards by making qualifying purchases of jtv merchandise and services which are offered on jtv’s television broadcast, online at jtv.com or on jtv mobile apps. from time to time, and at our sole discretion, jtv may make other types of promotional offers under the brilliant cash rewards program, which may or may not require a purchase. all promotional offers are subject to certain conditions or limitations, which vary depending on the specific limited offer. you should carefully review all terms that accompany any promotional offers you may receive as terms may contain expiration dates and other restrictions as well as change or be discontinued without notice. see more information about the jtv brilliant cash rewards program and terms for current promotions. can i make a purchase using gift cards and brilliant cash rewards? yes, you can combine gift cards with your brilliant cash rewards to make a purchase from us. can i use my gift card for a stretch pay purchase? jtv’s stretch pay™ program allows you to pay for our merchandise in installments. you can use your gift card to make the first stretchpay payment (we call this your “deposit”), although we may need to make a slight adjustment to that payment to set up your method of payment for future installments. you can’t use your gift card to make payments on any existing installment plans, such as those you may have for previous stretchpay™ purchases. if your gift card balance won’t cover your first payment on your stretch pay™ purchase (and the difference is more than $1), you may simply apply your gift card balance to the first payment, and we’ll charge your method of payment for the remaining amount. for example, if your first payment is $100 and your gift card balance is $40, we’ll reduce your gift card balance by $40 and charge your method of payment for what’s left over ($60). if your gift card balance is larger than the amount of the first payment, we’ll need to add one small step--charging your method of payment for $1. this will allow us to set up your method of payment for the future installments. we’ll also need to add this step if you want to use your gift card and brilliant cash rewards to make the first payment and the combined balances exceed the amount of that payment. here’s an example of how this will work. nadine is purchasing a $500 item on stretch pay™. she’ll have a total of five payments of $100. nadine has $75 in her rewards account and a $50 jtv gift card. she wants to use them both for her first payment. we’ll reduce her rewards balance by $75. we’ll then reduce her jtv gift card by $24 and charge her credit card for $1. at that point, nadine will have made her first stretchpay™ payment, and she’ll still have $26 left on her jtv gift card. her remaining stretchpay™ installments will be charged to her credit card. can i use my gift card to make payments on my credit cards? no, you cannot use a gift card to make payments on your credit card. what if my gift card is lost, stolen or used without my authorization? please safeguard your gift card as you would cash. if it is lost, stolen or used without your authorization, it cannot be replaced. can i buy a gift card for myself? yes, you can purchase a gift card for yourself. for egiftcards, go to the "email" tab underneath "how would you like to deliver your egiftcard?" on this tab, enter your own email address in the "to" and "confirm recipient" fields. you should also enter your own name as the "recipient name" in the egiftcard preview area at the top of the page. complete the transaction normally. when you receive your egiftcard alert via email, follow the instructions in this message to retrieve and redeem your egiftcard. for physical gift cards, you can simply order a gift card and use it after it arrives. what happens to my gift card balance if i return items i’ve bought with a gift card? returns of jtv merchandise and services, which are purchased in whole or part with a gift card, are subject to jtv’s standard return policies and procedures. for all returns on purchases made by redeeming a gift card in whole or part, jtv will credit your jtv account. your refund will be allocated between the methods of payment you used for your original purchase. if you redeemed a gift card for the entire purchase amount of the item you are returning, a refund of that amount will be applied to your jtv account, less any charges connected with the return such as shipping (“return expenses”) amounts paid using multiple methods of payment, such as a visa and a gift card, will be refunded in the same amounts to the original method of payment and to your jtv account, less any return expenses. for example, imagine you bought a beautiful chrome diopside and zircon ring set in sterling silver for $89.99, and you snagged an offer with free shipping. to buy the ring, you used the $50 balance on your plastic gift card and put $39.99 on your visa card. you decide to return the ring. jtv would issue a $50 merchandise return credit to your jtv account. in addition, jtv would credit your visa card for $39.99. returns on purchases made in whole or part using rewards from the jtv brilliant cash rewards program are subject additional terms and conditions. what exactly does the recipient receive when i send an egiftcard? an egiftcard is an electronic gift card that is sent via email. on the delivery date you choose, a message is sent to the recipient informing them of your gift, with a link to retrieve it online. the link in the email goes to a page showing the egiftcard you created (the design you selected, with your recipient's name and your personalized message), its value and code number. this page also gives simple instructions for redeeming the egiftcard, including printing instructions. sometimes, special offers and promotions are listed on the page along with any terms and conditions applicable to those offers and promotions. i want a printed egiftcard to present to someone as a gift. how do i do this? simply personalize the egiftcard for your recipient, have it sent to yourself and then print it. to do this, go to the "print" tab underneath "how would you like to deliver your egiftcard?” on this tab, enter your own email address in the "your email" and "confirm your email" fields. enter your recipient's name and your personal message on the egiftcard preview and complete the transaction normally. you will receive an egiftcard alert via email. follow the instructions in this message to retrieve your egiftcard and then choose "click to print this page." the resulting printout may be presented as a gift to the recipient. can i send two (or more) egiftcards to two (or more) different people who share an email address? yes, for example, if you send separate egiftcards to aunt mary and uncle jim at their shared email address, they will receive two messages with the subject "[sender] sent you an egiftcard from jtv” with your name in place of [sender]. within the text of the emails, each message will be addressed to the respective recipient, using the name you entered in the purchase process, for example: "mary smith, john jones sent you a $xx egiftcard from jtv.” remember, multiple card orders are subject to limitations on dollar amounts. gift cards may be loaded in value in the minimum amount of twenty-five dollars ($25) up to five hundred dollars ($500). the total value added to any single gift card (either through purchase or reloading) may not exceed five hundred dollars ($500). total purchases of gift cards for any one individual person in a single transaction may not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in one calendar day (24-hour period) or ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for all transactions combined in one calendar day (24-hour period). what are some common reasons why my recipient hasn’t viewed her egift card? we adhere to industry best practices to ensure successful delivery of the egiftcard via email. still, there is a chance that the email will be treated as spam or the recipient won’t notice it in their email inbox. if you have confirmed the recipient's email address, but the egiftcard has not been viewed within a reasonable period after the requested delivery date, the following is a list of the most common reasons why delivery may have failed: a spam filter blocked the email or routed it to a bulk/spam folder, the recipient's firewall blocked the email, the email inbox is over a size limit or the email address is invalid. if a spam filter is blocking gift card emails from getting to an inbox, the email options will need to be modified so that emails concerning the gift cards are not considered spam. this may include adding jtvgiftcards@cashstar.com as a safe sender to your email security options. if you need further assistance, contact jtv by calling the jtv call center at 1-800-619-3000 (available 24 hrs/day), or by emailing jtvgiftcards@jtv.com. please refer to your order number or be ready to supply your email address. how do i know the recipient received the egiftcard i sent them? you will receive an email message confirming the egiftcard has been sent to the recipient. we are not responsible for gift cards that are undeliverable or not received due to your failure to provide an accurate physical address or email address for the recipient. please check to make sure the address of the recipient is correct and contact jtv by calling the jtv call center at 1-800-619-3000 (available 24 hrs/day), or by emailing jtvgiftcards@jtv.com if you suspect the recipient did not receive his/her gift card. please refer to your order number or be ready to supply your email address. should an email be returned to us due to inaccurate delivery information for the recipient, we will attempt to contact you for a valid email address. do i need to print my egiftcard in color? do i need a special printer? most standard office and household printers are equipped to print egiftcards and you do not need to print in color. some printers produce great results, and older printers sometimes don't print certain images well, but the most important thing is that the card number is clear. if it is not, you may need to install a new ink cartridge. what if someone makes a copy of my printed egiftcard? you must safeguard your egiftcard for your own protection. if someone makes a copy of your gift card and redeems it for the full amount, your copy will have no value. no matter how many copies are made, the value of the egiftcard is tied to the gift card number. when that number is used, the value of the purchase is deducted from the egiftcard. protect your gift card as you would cash. if it is lost or stolen or used without authorization, it will not be replaced. can i use my jtv gift card with a promotional financing offer? we're sorry, but jtv gift cards cannot be used with any promotional financing offers at this time. you will need to remove the jtv gift card as your method of payment or remove the promotional financing option to proceed with the checkout process.
