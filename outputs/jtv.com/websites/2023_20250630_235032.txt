issues, inventory location, or fulfillment issues may also extend the delivery period. if you select and pay for one of the expedited shipping methods and unexpected issues prevent timely deliveries, our policy is to timely communicate with you regarding the delays. *numerous situations can prevent shipment of a standard shipping order within the normal 1-5 business day period including: orders not in stock, kits, international orders, virtual inventory and other order types as necessary. in any event, if your standard shipping order is not to ship within 10 business days, we send you a
