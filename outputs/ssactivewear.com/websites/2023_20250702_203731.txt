an avs (address verification system) mismatch occurs when the billing information entered into the checkout form does not match the information on file with the bank for that card. although your bank has confirmed that you have sufficient funds, our system has chosen not to take them. this is done to prevent fraudulent orders. time you submit an order, the bank places an authorization hold for the charge amount on your account. in the event of an avs mismatch, this authorization will not be captured by our system, and the pending charge you see on your online banking will disappear in 1-3 days. how do i fix it? to avoid avs mismatch errors at checkout, please make sure to enter your billing information exactly as it appears on your bank billing statement. i’m sure it’s correct, what now? if you're 100% sure the billing information is correct, your bank may be declining the transaction because it's being routed through one of our international merchant processors. you'll have to call your bank and let them know this is a legitimate transaction before trying again. is s&s activewear attending any upcoming tradeshows?
