effectively to real-world business requirements. that's why the 3m keyboard tray selection gives you such an array of product options. you can choose a keyboard tray if you'd like to store your keyboard and mouse swiftly underneath your desk or you can choose a keyboard drawer if you'd like a unit that sits on top of the desk and doubles as a monitor stand. 3m keyboard trays come with mouse pads and mouse trays that sit either directly adjacent to the keyboard or are attachable on either side of the tray for the convenience of left- or right-handed mouse users. in addition, most 3m trays include a wrist rest (often gel-filled) that supports your wrists in order to avoid repetitive stress injuries. 3m keyboard tray options have a wide variety of features to fulfill your additional business needs and values. for example, cable management guides on many models reduce tangled cord hazards and keep your workspace organized and tidy. numerous models include a wrist rest that's antimicrobial, thereby extending the life of the product by inhibiting the growth of damaging microorganisms. some come with a mousing surface that's proven to lengthen the life of wireless mouse batteries, while others can be mounted to your desk without tools. the 3m keyboard tray selection includes compact trays, swiveling trays, trays with and without adjustment knobs, trays that contain recycled materials, and trays that are recommended for straight, curved, diagonal, or corner workstations. peruse the 3m keyboard tray selection and decide which features work best for you. 0 items
