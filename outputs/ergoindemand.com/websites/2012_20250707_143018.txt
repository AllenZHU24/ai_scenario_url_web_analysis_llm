whether you work at an office desk, training table, or computer workstation, it's a good idea to optimize the height your work surface for typing, note-taking, or computer viewing. you should be able to relax your arms at a 90 degree angle and look straight ahead without straining your neck as you work. consider a computer desk with multiple tiers for monitor and keyboard, or ideally, a height adjustable desk that you can customize to your needs. keep files and accessories in easy reach - do you access your printer, hanging files, phone, or laptop often during the day? use a mobile laptop cart, printer cart, or file cart to keep your files and equipment accessible while keeping your desktop clean. keep out the noise - if you work in a busy environment, use office dividers to isolate your working space from the chaos around you. mobile room dividers are easy to arrange and rearrange as needed, creating not only a visual barrier, but also a sound barrier, and if necessary, a light barrier to manage glare. environmental standards at ergo in demand, we believe in building comfortable, functional workspaces that uphold healthful standards while you're getting things done. many consumers are aware that the environmental credentials of the products they buy affect the health standard of their office, home, and school interiors, as well as the environment at large. we've made an effort to label and catalog our office furniture products so that the conscientious consumer can find more eco-friendly solutions. in general, eco-friendly products are produced in a more sustainable way and less likely to emit harmful chemicals into your interiors. customer service about us contact us f.a.q. ordering pricing & ordering exchanges & returns privacy policy partner links dealer program affiliate program resources learning center about ergonomics product reviews pdf sitemap site links home page product sitemap testimonials find us on: facebook twitter youtube blog © copyright 2000 to 2011  ~  ergo in demand, inc.  ~  4900 industry drive,  central point, or 97502
