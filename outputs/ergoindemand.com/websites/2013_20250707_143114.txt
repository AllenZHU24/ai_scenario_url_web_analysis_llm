(quotation translated by wilmer cave wright- chicago: university of chicago press; 1940). research has helped determine computer ergonomics. today, numerous universities like cornell, stanford, uc davis, u of virginia, ucla and others have done intense studies highlighting the benefit of ergonomic computer workstations and the dangers to workers' health arising by not following certain principles. their research on computer ergonomics is important for the working individual as well as for the employer who is interested in limiting absenteeism, and in increasing worker productivity. cornell university has created simple-to-follow 12 step ergonomic guidelines that will help you improve your working environment and protect your health while working at a computer workstation. the following easy to follow guidelines for computer ergonomics were adapted from the dea651 class of 2000 - bethany johnson; emily kuperstein; mari mitchell; heidi tinnes; with garrick goh (ta) and professor alan hedge. use a good chair with a dynamic chair back that is angled slightly to the rear. top of monitor screen should be 2-3" above eye level no glare on screen; use an optical glass anti-glare filter where needed sit at arms length from monitor; further if distance is comfortable and screen's readable. rest feet on floor or on a stable foot rest (move feet frequently for circulation) use a document holder, preferably in-line with the computer screen wrists flat and straight in relation to forearms to use keyboard/mouse/input device keeps arms and elbows relaxed close to body center monitor and keyboard in front of you use a negative tilt keyboard tray with an upper mouse platform or downward tilt-able platform adjacent to keyboard use a stable work surface and

rolled-up towel or back support cushion. the chair's back should not be set straight upright but angled slightly backwards to 135� in order to reduce strain on the spine and ligaments. the results of research that was conducted at woodend hospital in aberdeen, scotland was presented to the radiological society of north america (rsna) on november 27, 2006 (and reported in science daily). it noted that the use of a "positional mri" demonstrated that a 135� back angle (while feet were resting on the floor) provided less strain and wear and tear on a back's spine, muscles and tendons than either a 90� sitting position or sitting slouched. adjust your armrests for a neutral arm position or remove the arm rests if they are not useful. always use the chair adjustment functions to create a better fit. it is important that your chair height be set so that feet can rest on the floor. if the chair is higher, you can place your feet on an ergonomic footrest. 2. your monitor's height is important for healthy computer work. you should be able to view the screen without having to turn your head or tilt it up or down. there is a general rule that the top of your monitor should be positioned 2" to 3" above your seated eye level. decide what setting is most comfortable and doesn't require your head to turn or tilt. there are height adjustable desks and using an ergonomic computer workstation helps set your comfortable sitting position and monitor height. a much easier solution is to place monitors on flexible, counterbalanced lcd monitor arms. laptop users will benefit with a height adjustable laptop stand which can accommodate to a variety of workers and work postures. ergonomic computer furniture adjustable desks and stands for offices, schools and homes laptop accessories

positioning. lcd monitor arms mounted to your desk or wall or pole 5. stable foot placement. as already mentioned, you should adjust your chair so that your feet rest on the floor or purchase an
