vehicle, or machine without bending, twisting, or reaching. we offer gn netcom, logitech, and plantronics headsets. footrests offer important relief for the lower body when sitting for long periods. an adjustable footrest compliments an ergonomic office workstation by propping up the feet at a more natural angle, engaging the legs and helping to take weight off the low back. anti fatigue mats are an ergonomic imperative for jobs that demand a lot of standing. whether your station is a hot stove, industrial deck, or cash register, an anti fatigue mat can make a world of difference in your comfort and productivity. keyboard tray and keyboard drawer systems allow you to set up your keyboard and mouse on a separate platform from your desk, clearing desk space and enabling a more ergonomic typing posture. adjustable keyboard trays offer height and tilt adjustment to optimize your arm reach and hand position relative to your seat height and screen height. if you use a crt monitor or a laptop, a monitor riser or laptop riser is your ergonomic solution. inexpensive laptop risers, monitor risers, and crt stands efficiently raise your screen to a more ergonomic viewing height when a high-tech arm is not required. phone arms and phone stands offer an easier ergonomic reach when you're sitting at your desk busy with other applications. a phone stand raises the receiver and positions it at a slight incline. a telescoping phone arm makes the telephone accessible to both sides of an l shaped workstation. if you use a computer heavily, a wrist rest can be a highly beneficial ergonomic accessory. wrist rests help protect against the occupational hazards of extensive typing and clicking, including carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) and other repetitive stress injuries (rsi). choosing an ergonomic keyboard and computer mouse is an important step towards a healthier computer workstation. ergonomic keyboards and mouses are anatomically contoured to support the repetitive movements that cause you the most strain at the computer. 0 items resources and buying guide for greening your workspace recycled view definition renewable view definition sustainable view
