stand desk. experts have long recommended that those who spend many hours sitting at a desk get up on their feet periodically. but how many of us find an excuse to leave our desks every hour for the sake of our health? with a sit stand desk, you can alternate between sitting and standing without interrupting your work, giving your body much more variation and relief than a two minute break would do. and with an electric desk, you can make fast, smooth, and quiet adjustments as often as you want without interrupting others. avoid the risk of repetitive stress injury (rsi) by encouraging your body to stay fluid while at work. the greatest physical damage to workers comes not from sitting or standing alone, but from remaining in one posture overly long, overburdening certain muscles and joints while others go flaccid. getting to your feet periodically reactivates the brain and body and makes you feel freer to move around, in small ways as well as on brief errands. use an adjustable desk to alternate between standing and sitting positions, relieving your low back and your feet in turn. if you're an employer, beat the rising tide of worker's compensation claims by investing in the height adjustable desk. share this page 0 items customer service ordering partner links learning center site links about us pricing & ordering dealer program buyer's guide home page contact us
