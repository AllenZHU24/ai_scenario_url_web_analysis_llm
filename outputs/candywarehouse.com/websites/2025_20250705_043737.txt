different types of candies have different shelf lives. as one of the largest online candy stores in the country, it is our responsibility to provide customers with the highest quality sweets, as well as helpful information that will help you to snack carefully. we constantly monitor and rotate all our products, to ensure that customers like you receive nothing but the freshest, best-tasting candy or chocolate possible. as a rule of thumb, you should avoid ordering a large amount of candy too far in advance of any event or occasion. most candies have a shelf life of at least one to two months, so long as they are stored at an appropriate temperature. if you are hosting a birthday party, corporate event, or wedding, we recommend ordering your candy approximately one month prior to the event. we process orders as we receive them and may not always have every product in stock. despite our strong national buying power, we order small quantities from manufacturers to ensure that our inventory stays fresh and new. give yourself and us a little time to fulfill special orders or replace any out-of-stock products. candy shelf life guidelines: these guidelines assume that products are unopened and properly stored. hard candy shelf life will vary, but hard sweets that have been stored at room temperature or in cool, dry conditions can last up to one year. bubblegum: two months candy bars: one month candy corn: two months caramel: 12 months concession candy: one month dark chocolate: two months gummy candy: 12 months hard candy: 12 months jelly beans: six months jordan almonds: two months licorice: two months lollipops: 12 months milk or white chocolate: three months mints: 24 months novelty candy: 12 months remember that candy shelf life can greatly depend on how it is stored. no candy likes to be too hot. high temperatures can discolor, melt, or warp candy, especially chocolate or coated varieties. candy with peanuts and soft candies have short shelf lives due to consistency or manufacturing practices. though still safe to eat, you should avoid freezing and refrigerating chocolates, because cold temperatures can cause the cocoa butter to rise to the surface. if you have any questions or concerns about soft or hard candy shelf life, please contact candywarehouse.com today to learn more. and remember, as a general rule of thumb: no candy likes to be hot! high temperatures disfigure, melt (especially chocolate, even if they are coated), discolor, and cause candy to stick to wrappers, especially lollipops. any candy with nuts will have a shorter life span and should be consumed within 1 month of ordering. softer candies such as caramel creams or brach's royals have a shorter shelf life due to their consistency. do not refrigerate or freeze chocolates, as this causes the cocoa butter in the chocolate to rise to the surface and creates a white-ish, discoloring effect. yet, in this case, the chocolate is still perfectly safe to eat, it just doesn't look appetizing. hopefully this information answers all of your candy shelf life questions, but if not, please just email us or give us a call to speak with a jolly candy elf. sign up for special offers & delicious candy! this customer is already subscribed email sign up candy warehouse footer menu about us candy elves & friends clean and tidy warehouse candy ambassador candy warehouse reviews fundraise with candy warehouse recognition site map b2b login customer care footer customer care menu contact us faqs shipping policy return policy privacy policy cookie policy terms of service us laws compliance do not sell or share my personal information resources footer resources menu candy blog check order status corporate gifts candy shelf life gluten free candy kosher candy wedding candy accessibility statement industries we serve location location contact numbertel: (310) 343-4099mailing addressp.o. box 16187sugar land, tx 77496texas warehouse 2661 midway road, ste 200carrollton, tx 75006 contact us contact us callemailchat with us! üëã american express american express apple pay apple pay diners club diners club discover discover google pay google pay mastercard master paypal paypal shop pay shopify pay venmo venmo visa visa copyright ¬© 1998-2024. all rights reserved. candywarehouse.com, inc. - bulk candy store facebook twitter tiktok pinterest instagram youtube https://x.com/candywarehouse search clear {"themecolor":"#574cd5","iconcolor":"#574cd5","showlogo":true,"topbottomposition":10,"rightleftposition":10,"iconsize":"small","iconcustomsize":64,"position":"bottom-left"}
