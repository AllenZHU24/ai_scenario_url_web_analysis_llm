these popular candies include our handy "candy calculator" feature, which can tell you how many bags you need with just the click of a button!we recommend that you share your shoe box of candy with others. don't hoard the candy all to yourself.... that would be naughty.i'm having a fabulous candy buffet at my wedding. how far in advance should i purchase my candy?we recommend purchasing at least one month in advance of the day that you will need your candy. all of our products have a shelf life of at least 2 months. your candy will remain fresh if you keep it sealed and stored at room temperature prior to the event. the one month period allows for ups or fedex mistakes such as losing your package in transit. it also allows you time to order more bulk candy if your initial quantity estimates are off. (or if you binge on the candy yourself before the big day!) you can also learn more about candy buffets by checking out our candy buffet tips and tricks.the website says you sell jelly beans in a fifty-pound case, but i only want eleven pounds. will you send me a smaller quantity?sorry, but we aren't licensed by the health department to open cases. all candy is shipped just the way we receive it from the manufacturer- we can't break open cases.will you send me a sample before i buy?again, we can't open cases, so we don't send samples.how clean is your warehouse?candywarehouse.com ensures that our warehouse is clean, tidy, and organized so that our customers always receive the freshest product in perfect condition. we have regular inspections by the orkin man for pests or any creatures that may try to meddle with our candy. plus, our warehouse is always kept cool in our new temperature controlled warehouse which guarantees that our chocolates are not melted in any way.what is the shelf life of candy?you can read more about different candy's shelf life here.do you have kosher candy?we sure do. you can learn more about kosher candy here or see a list of kosher candy here. there's also a page about mitzvah candy here.i want to create a candy buffet for a party with 200 guests. how much candy and what types of candy should i order?please visit our candy buffet builder and read our tips & tricks for useful information on what type of candy and how much candy to order for your special event. get inspired by our candy buffet photo galleries, then dive in to the buffet builder and shop candy by color, type, and occasion to create your own custom candy buffet.do m&ms have contain any gluten, e.g. in starch ingredients? my husband has gluten allergy but there is no info on your website about this. thank you.all m&ms are gluten free, except for pretzel m&ms (which contain wheat). however, mars manufactures most of their m&m products in the same factories, so there is always a chance of cross-contamination between the pretzel products and all the rest. while the chance is rather small, this is an important note to take into consideration for individuals who are very gluten sensitive. learn more about gluten free candy.do you have any delicious sugar free candy for diabetics?we do! from chocolates to hard candies to gummies and everything in between, check out our delicious range of sugar free candies here: sugar free candyis it possible to get ingredient/ food allergy information before ordering? we're planning on doing a candy buffet for a child's birthday with severe food allergies.candywarehouse is not the manufacturer of any of the products on our website, so we would not be able to provide you with any specific ingredient or allergen information. we would suggest that you contact the manufacturer directly to get the most reliable and up-to-date information.what is the most popular candy sold at candywarehouse.com?we have a number of top-selling items, due simply to the wide variety of candy for different holidays, seasons, and special occassions. thus, best sellers often vary from month to month. but if you want to check out what's hot at the moment, you can always take a peek at the top sellers tab on our homepage!when an item says out of stock, how long does it take to be in stock? to make sure our candy stays as fresh as possible, we run out of inventory from time to time. when that happens, the arrival date of new sweets is dependent upon many factors, but the best option is to enter your email address into our inventory alert system. then we will automatically email you as soon as the item is back in stock in our warehouse. some bulk candy will be on order the second they’re running low, so those might be back in stock in a matter of days. other candies are seasonal and are only available at certain times of the year. in these cases, it may take months. in some instances, extenuating circumstances may have prevented a candy from being produced a certain year, or the candy may have been discontinued by the manufacturer. permanent discontinuations are typically marked as such on the product page. in short, there’s no exact time frame in which you can expect a product to return to our warehouse, so if you have specific questions, feel free to contact customer care for more information.my candy showed up in the mail, but it’s hard as a rock! i didn’t order hard candy… what gives?certain candies (such as chocolates, gummies, and caramels) are capable of freezing during the shipping process, so during cold weather months, they may do just that! remember, any candies marked "meltable" are also susceptible to chilly temperatures. so if your candy happens to arrive a little harder than you expected, just set it out in a room temperature environment and allow it time to thaw. note: it may take up to 48 hours for candy to return to normal, but rest assured that its quality has in no way been compromised!do you have gluten-free candy?yes, we sure do! look for the gluten free certification symbol on any product page to determine if a certain candy makes that claim. but keep in mind that not all gluten free items are marked as such on the packaging, though they have been certified as such by the manufacturer. learn more about gluten-free candy.is all of your candy made in the usa?our immense bulk candy store offers sweets manufactured from all over the world. that being said, most of the candy we sell is made in the usa. most product information pages list the country of origin unless we don't know for sure where the candy is made. some manufacturers make products in different factories in different countries, so we can't know exactly where those candies are produced. happy shopping!do you have gummy bears without corn syrup?hello,at this time, all of our gummi bears contain corn syrup, even the organic ones. we did carry some by surf sweets that used organic tapioc syrup as an alternative to corn syrup, but they have been discontinued. unfortunately corn syrup it is a necessary ingredient when making gealtins that seems to be better than any alternatives as per manufacturer testing. best to you on finding a corn-syrup free gummy!have a sweet day! :)the candy elvesdoes your classic gumball machine take the bigger gum ball or just the small ones?sorry, the classic gumball machine accepts only small gumballs with a diameter of about 0.5 inch.i want to order chocolate for party favors but my event is a month from now. can i put the chocolate in the fridge until then?absolutely not. putting chocolate in a refrigerator will cause the chocolate to bloom, meaning the cocoa butter in the chocolate will rise to the top and give the chocolate a white coating which does not look appetizing. although completely safe to eat, the chocolate will not be presentable. to preserve the quality of chocolate, the best solution is to store it in a cool, dry place (a temperature of 65 degrees fahrenheit and low humidity).you have thousands of candies marked as made in the usa. is this really true?yes, we stock over 6,000 fresh bulk candy items and most are manufactured right here in the good ole usa. plus we import exotic candies from all over the world! our giant candy store has the largest selection of unique sweets anywhere.do you offer custom candy packaging?yes, our creative department offers unique concepts, high quality, and fast delivery times! just visit our custom candy page for more information.can i buy just the blue sour patch kids?sorry, but sour patch kids candy is not sold by individual color. we are hopeful that mondelez, the manufacturer of sour patch kids, will someday offer that option.i'm looking for brachs rich and dreamy chocolate cremes. do you have them or are you capable of getting them? sorry, the brach's rich and dreamy chocolate cremes are no longer manufactured. we do have many other options from brach's candy in stock and ready to ship now. the brach's pick a mix product line has been severely shrunk over the years. now that the brand is under new ownership in 2018, hopefully some of these great candy classics will return.are the red/cherry tootsie pops you sell in the red wrapper identical to the ones i grew up and fell in love with? (i’m 65y.o.! ) cherry hard candy with a tootsie roll center ! thanks. i hope we can do business.. (my dentist may hope i do also.)toddhello todd!thanks for reaching out. yes, item 125432-https://www.candywarehouse.com/cherry-tootsie-pops-28-piece-bag/ will be the classic cherry flavor you remember with the tootsie roll center. please feel free to give us a ring at 310-343-4099 and we can place that order over the phone for you : )shipping questionshow much does shipping cost?shipping charges vary depending upon your location in the united states and the shipping service that you select. the shipping charge approximately doubles for every upgrade that you perform.... the "2 business days" delivery method will cost about twice as much as the "3 to 4 business days" method. in an effort to be totally transparent about shipping costs, we offer you the option to utilize your own ups or fedex account if you feel you can get better pricing with those carriers yourself. just select "freight collect" as the shipping method and enter your own ups or fedex account number. for freight collect orders, ups or fedex will bill you directly for the actual shipping costs of your packages. you can learn more about shipping on our shipping page here.why is shipping so expensive?we agree, shipping sure can be expensive. unfortunately, shipping costs are determined by weight and bulk candy has a high shipping-to-product-cost ratio. here is an example: you purchase a diamond for $1,000 and the shipping cost will be say, $20 (2% of the price of the diamond); on the other hand, when you purchase $1,000 worth of candy, your shipping cost will more likely be $200 (20% of the price of the candy). this percentage may be 100% if you are placing a small order ($15 of candy may cost $15 to ship). products such as jewelry, cds, electronics, clothing, and flowers are light; therefore, their shipping costs will not represent a large percentage of their total order cost. sweets, for better or for worse, outweigh the competition!does candywarehouse.com ship to canada?unfortunately, we do not ship to canada. however, you can ship your order to friends or family in the u.s. or a mail forwarder of your choice.can i have my own freight account (e.g., ups, fedex, etc.) billed for shipping expenses?yes. just check the box that says "i want to enter my own account information" on the shipping page when checking out. make sure to (1) type your freight account information/ number and (2) select your desired shipping method (e.g., ground shipping, next day air, etc.). *important* - if you select this option, candywarehouse.com relies on your promise that your freight account is valid and can be billed directly. in the event you or your company does not pay the shipping charges directly to your freight company and as a result candywarehouse.com is charged such costs, we will automatically bill your credit card for such shipping costs plus a $10 processing fee.how does candywarehouse.com ensure the integrity of packages?the candy elves in our warehouse seal every box with our company logo packing tape to ensure that you can detect if the package has been tampered with during transit. if you notice that any seals on the box have been cut or broken open during transit, simply refuse the package so that we can do a damage claim with ups or fedex.how do i know chocolates and other heat-sensitive candies won't melt in transit during warm weather, especially summer?unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that certain candies will not melt, but we do our utmost to safeguard against it. most importantly, choose an expedited shipping method ("3 to 4 business days" or "2 business days") and not ground. unlike many of our counterparts, candywarehouse.com provides free gel ice packs with expedited orders of meltable products and ground shipments within 2 days of origin, and does not charge for this added service. unfortunately, ice packs only last approximately 48 hours, so they cannot fully prevent heat exposure, and bust open, so we do not include them automatically on longer shipments. up to an additional 24 hours of protection for ground shipments can be purchased at checkout in the form of our "kodiakooler insulated boxes", and enough for your meltables will be suggested as you proceed to checkout. additionally, we only ship orders containing meltables on mondays, tuesdays, and wednesdays during warm weather to ensure that your candy will not be stuck in a hot ups or fedex hub over the weekend (defeating the purpose of you paying extra for expedited shipping!). we try our best to account for this in our eta, but this is not always perfect, so please be on the lookout for communications from our team! our guarantee: if you take these precautions – purchase insulated boxes and select an expedited shipping method to a valid business address where someone is there to receive the package on the first attempt, and if your candy still melts, we will provide a refund for those melted items. but sorry, we will not reship items that have melted in transit. learn more about summer shipping here.how long will it take for delivery of an order? when should i expect my candy?our website displays an estimated delivery date range on all product pages just below the "add to cart" button. sorry, these dates are not guaranteed and of course exclude time delays caused by natural disasters and other "acts of god" such as: blizzard, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, ice storm, flood, zombie apocalypse, or teamster union strike.where do i include delivery instructions for ups or fedex?we often get requests to deliver before a certain time, leave the package in the garage, leave the package with a neighbor, etc. right now, we aren't able to pass on your instructions to ups or fedex. you can give delivery instructions that will stay in ups's files- just call 1-800-pick-ups. otherwise, we'd suggest leaving a note on the door.can i pick up my candy order myself at your warehouse?absolutely! if you live in the los angeles area of california or the charlotte area of north carolina, you can save on shipping costs and arrange to drive to a warehouse to pick-up your order. but, you must submit your online order first, and make sure you have received a phone call or email from us detailing that your order is ready for pick-up before coming in. keep in mind that we require up to two business days to process your order. if you have fast-approaching a deadline or plan to be in the neighborhood on a specific date, call us first and we will let you know if we can rush the order through for you. we look forward to your visit!does candywarehouse.com ship to countries outside of the united states?our website only accepts online orders placed within the usa. however, if you would like to purchase products from a non-us location, you have two options: have someone within our service area place your order for you within the united states using a credit card with a us billing address. you can either collect the product if you are going to be in the country, or have it shipped to you. unfortunately, we will not be able to handle any of the export or shipping process.place an order from outside our service area by contacting customer care. you will be entirely responsible for all shipping, customs, and duties that may apply. we are also unable to provide any broker or expert services or paperwork. all payments must be made in the form of a wire transfer, a cleared check, or a cashier's check. if you would like to place an order this way, please call customer care at (310) 343-4099 and speak to a representative who can help you with our international processing.ups may have international shipping for the country in which you reside. please contact ups at 1-800-782-7892 for informationplease note we cannot release an order until all funds are received. you may contact our customer service department to place an international order at (310) 343-4099. see our shipping policy for more details.do you ship to apo addresses?yes!

other?candywarehouse ships with ups primarily, but we also send packages of bulk candy to military addresses all over the world via usps. customers also have the option to use their own carrier account for fedex or ups.can i get my order in india. what will be the shipping charges?no, candywarehouse.com does not currently ship to india. sorry.hello, for pick up what is the earliest we can pick up?for pick-up orders, the hours for our warehouses in charlotte, nc and long beach, ca are listed on our website, google maps location pages, and yelp listings. our earliest pick-up time is currently 8am.what is the time frame for standard shipping?standard shipping usually means delivery in two business days, unless the delivery location is a remote or very rural area.if i have sent a gift to someone, will the price or any info of the products (other than your company's name) show up on the package?ordering candy gifts for shipment directly to friends and loved ones?
