an order and keep in mind the following (if you have any concerns or specific requirements, please call us before you place your order):quantity: think through and calculate how much candy you will need for an event or project.taste: manufacturers sometimes change their recipes, and your taste buds change too.color: some of our products are hand-made in batches and color may vary. colors may also look different from one computer monitor to the next.brand variance: different brands of candy like gummies, taffies, caramels, etc. vary in consistency, texture, firmness, etc. so, the same types of candies made by different brands will not always taste the same (e.g., european-brand gummies tend to be harder than american-brand gummies).heat: if it is warm in your area, stay away from heat-sensitive items as we do not refund for melting! and always make sure someone is around to receive the package.mistakes: double check your online order before hitting that submit button!of
