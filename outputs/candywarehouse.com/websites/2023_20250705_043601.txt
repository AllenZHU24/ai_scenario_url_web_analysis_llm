and always make sure someone is around to receive the package. mistakes: double check your online order before hitting that submit button! of course, if we make any mistakes with your order, we will take full responsibility – just make sure that you contact us within 10 business days of receiving your order, as we cannot approve any requests for refunds/reships after such time. refusal of package: if parcels are refused, original and return shipping costs will be charged to the purchaser's original form of payment along with a 20% restocking fee. cancellations: our motto is "fresh candy shipped fast" and we genuinely mean it!  our candy elves will often pull, pack, and ship an order within minutes of our customers placing it. as soon as an order is "released" into our fulfillment system (which can be seconds after you push that submit button), it cannot be cancelled. of course you are welcome to call us and check whether an order has been released and if it has not, we are happy to process your cancellation. however, if a customer care representative sees the order has been "released" into our fulfillment system, they will be unable to cancel it. we have spent an extremely large amount of resources to develop and create this extremely quick and efficient automated turn-around system and if we were to cancel an order already released, that one act would interrupt our entire fulfillment cycle (potentially affecting hundreds of other orders). we appreciate your understanding on this matter and we urge you to please take the time to carefully make your selections before hitting that submit button!! if you are unable to cancel your order but still want to return the products, you have the option of returning or refusing the package once it arrives at your destination (see details above regarding returns and refusing packages). incorrect shipping address: if the customer provides the wrong address when placing an order, the following shall apply: if the order is returned to candywarehouse in good condition: customer will be responsible for the full cost of shipping as well as a twenty percent (20%) restocking fee. if the package is returned to candywarehouse but the contents are damaged or if the package is lost: no refunds. if the package is en route and the customer requests a shipment intercept/address correction:customer will be charged $17.20 per package/box (this cost is a direct fee from our delivery service provider). incorrectly ordered items: in order for credit to be received for incorrectly ordered items, the product must be returned, at purchaser’s expense, to our return address listed above, and must be in the same condition as it was received. in the event that you would like us to provide a call tag for said return, there is a non-refundable fifteen ($15) dollar fee. all returns caused by customer error may be subject to a twenty (20) percent restocking fee. merchandise must be returned, at purchaser's expense, in the same condition as it was received and it is up to the purchaser to choose a return delivery method that best suits their needs. please note that on orders caused by customer error, we are unable to issue credit for shipping in either direction. hot weather issues: as stated on our faq page, candywarehouse.com cannot take responsibility for products damaged in transit due to extremes in temperature, nor will we replace said product before reviewing the delivery circumstances involved. if questions arise as to perishability, please contact us and we will do our best to provide guidance. in the event that a product is received in unusable condition, for reasons other than extremes of temperature, a claim must be submitted within five (5) days after physical receipt of merchandise as determined by fedex tracking. in the event that a claim is submitted after the stated time period, we will not be able to issue credit nor refund product. special orders no returns on special order products. seasonal orders due to the limited quantity of seasonal candies, please note that the purchase of all seasonal merchandise, perishable or non-perishable, is non returnable. missing items in the event that an order is received and there is a discrepancy as to a missing item, a claim must be submitted within two (2) business days of physical receipt as determined by fedex tracking. we will compare items ordered as well as physical weight of the package and issue a store credit accordingly. orders with incorrect merchandise in the event that incorrect merchandise is received, we will do our best to correct the error in a timely fashion. in the event of an exchange, we will ship corrected merchandise at the shipping service level at which it was purchased. for instance, if the incorrect merchandise was shipped via fedex ground, it will be shipped at the same service level. in the event that you opted for rush delivery, we will refund the cost of shipping the incorrect item. we will issue a call tag for the return of the incorrect merchandise and upon receipt, will issue credit accordingly. please note that we are unable to issue credit for any product in which the factory seal is no longer intact. please note that in order for credit to be issued, notification of order discrepancies must be made within two (2) business days of receipt as determined by fedex tracking. candy warehouse about us come visit us candy elves & friends clean and tidy warehouse candy ambassador site map wholesale login customer care shipping policy faqs contact us check order status return policy terms of service privacy policy resources candy blog corporate gifts candy shelf life gluten free candy kosher candy wedding candy accessibility statement locations long beach candy store2520 mira mar ave.long beach, ca 90815310-343-4099 contact us callemailchat with us!
