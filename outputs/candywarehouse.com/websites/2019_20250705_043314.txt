candy last?different types of candies have different shelf lives. as one of the largest online candy stores in the country, it is our responsibility to provide customers with the highest quality sweets, as well as helpful information that will help you to snack carefully. we constantly monitor and rotate all our products, to ensure that customers like you receive nothing but the freshest, best-tasting candy or chocolate possible. as a rule of thumb, you should avoid ordering a large amount of candy too far in advance of any event or occasion. most candies have a shelf life of at least one to two months, so long as they are stored at an appropriate temperature. if you are hosting a birthday party, corporate event, or wedding, we recommend ordering your candy approximately one month prior to the event.we process orders as we receive them and may not always have every product in stock. despite our strong national buying power, we order small quantities from manufacturers to ensure that our inventory stays fresh and new. give yourself and us a little time to fulfill special orders or replace any out-of-stock products.candy shelf life guidelines:these guidelines assume that products are unopened and properly stored. hard candy shelf life will vary, but hard sweets that have been stored at room temperature or in cool, dry conditions can last up to one year.bubblegum: two monthscandy bars: one monthcandy corn: two monthscaramel: 12 monthsconcession candy: one monthdark chocolate: two monthsgummy candy: 12 monthshard candy: 12 monthsjelly beans: six monthsjordan almonds: two monthslicorice: two monthslollipops: 12 monthsmilk or white chocolate: three monthsmints: 24 monthsnovelty candy: 12 monthsremember that candy shelf life can greatly depend on how it is stored. no candy likes to be too hot. high temperatures can discolor, melt, or warp candy, especially chocolate or coated varieties. candy with peanuts and soft candies have short shelf lives due to consistency or manufacturing practices. though still safe to eat, you should avoid freezing and refrigerating chocolates, because cold temperatures can cause the cocoa butter to rise to the surface. if you have any questions or concerns about soft or hard candy shelf life, please contact candywarehouse.com today to learn more.and remember, as a general rule of thumb:no candy likes to be hot! high temperatures disfigure, melt (especially chocolate, even if they are coated), discolor, and cause candy to stick to wrappers, especially lollipops. any candy with nuts will have a shorter life span and should be consumed within 1 month of ordering. softer candies such as caramel creams or brach's royals have a shorter shelf life due to their consistency. do not refrigerate or freeze chocolates, as this causes the cocoa butter in the chocolate to rise to the surface and creates a white-ish, discoloring effect. yet, in this case, the chocolate is still perfectly safe to eat, it just doesn't look appetizing. hopefully this information answers all of your candy shelf life questions, but if not, please just email us or give us a call to speak with a jolly candy elf. back to top follow candy
