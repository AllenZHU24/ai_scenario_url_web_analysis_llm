shipping policy shipping policy fedex services across the midwest, and parts of the south and northeast, have been impacted by severe weather. while most fedex facilities are providing pickup and delivery services as conditions permit, some delays are possible. more info. general shipping we provide the following delivery options: standard ground: 5 – 8 business days, shipped via fedex, ups, or usps. expedited shipping: 3 – 4 business days, shipped via fedex or ups.overnight shipping: 2 business days, shipped via fedex or ups. if shipping to military locations (apo or fpo addresses), then the 3 – 4 business days option will be via usps priority mail and in certain cases may take up to 4 weeks for delivery to distant locations such as naval vessels, embassies, and remote bases. if you are shipping this way, we recommend placing your order by phone at 310-343-4099. freight collect: if you or your company has its own fedex account, you may choose to have fedex bill that account directly. simply check the box that says "i'd like to enter my own shipping account information" and select the method by which you would like your order shipped (ground, 2nd day, next day air, etc.). when you select freight collect, we rely on your promise to pay the freight charges directly to fedex. in the event you do not pay, fedex will charge the fees to candywarehouse.com and we will automatically (1) bill your credit card for such costs, (2) bill you a $10 processing fee and (3) prohibit any future orders to be shipped via this method. please note, candywarehouse does not know how much your freight account will charge you to ship our products so please inquire with your freight carrier directly for such information. if you would like to ship via fedex or another carrier, you may create your own shipping labels and have the order picked up from our warehouse. please keep in mind the following: no matter which shipping method is selected, we require between 2-4 business days to process your order (if you select fedex overnight, you may not receive your product the day after you place the order). an order must be received by 12:00 p.m. (pst) for the day the order was placed to qualify as a "business day". fedex does not deliver on sunday and will only deliver on saturday to certain locations for an additional charge. if you require a saturday delivery, please call us. our hub in carrolton tx sends shipments daily monday through friday (united states holidays excepted). placing an order does not guarantee shipment. we reserve the right to cancel or modify orders depending on availability. because we carry over 6,000 products and keep a limited inventory (so as to keep our inventory as fresh as possible), we may at times not have certain items in stock. **our shipping carrier is chosen dynamically between fedex and ups, depending on which offers the best transit time and lowest cost for your order.** shipping cost shipping charges are calculated using fedex, ups, and usps shipping tables and are based on package weight and size, delivery distance, and shipping method. shipping costs approximately double for every upgrade (e.g., overnight shipping will cost roughly twice that of 2 day shipping). unfortunately, weight plays a significant factor in determining shipping costs and bulk candy has a high shipping-to-product-cost ratio. for example: if you purchase a diamond for $1,000, shipping is likely going to be approximately $20, (2% of the diamond price). on the other hand, if you purchase $1,000 worth of candy, your shipping cost will likely be $200 (20% of the cost of the candy). if you order $15 of candy, the shipping cost may be as high as $15 (100% of the cost of the candy). products such as jewelry, cds, electronics, clothing, and flowers are light; therefore, their shipping costs will not represent a large percentage of their total order cost. sweets, for better or for worse, outweigh the competition! shipping promotions please note that any candywarehouse shipping promotions/discounts are not applicable to items listed as 'ships fresh directly from factory' and such promos are specific to candywarehouse items only. those products which 'ship fresh directly from factory' will incur their own delivery fees which are set by the respective manufacturers. address corrections and delivery intercepts the fedex/ups charge for an address correction is $21.00 per package. if you enter your address incorrectly when placing an order and fedex/ups bills us for address correction costs, we will in turn charge your credit card for all associated fedex/ups fees. if you change your mind about an order after it has already shipped from our warehouse and you would like to re-route the package(s) back to candywarehouse.com, the fedex/ups charge for a delivery intercept is $21.00 per package. we will automatically bill all associated fedex/ups fees to your credit card. service areas – domestic & international at this time we do not ship our products to countries outside of the united states nor do we accept international cards. we reserve the right to cancel or decline any payments made with a non-us based card. please note our website only accepts online orders placed within the usa (e.g., you are traveling in london and want to place an online order to be shipped to your home in new york, our system will not accept this order). if you would like to purchase products from a non-us location, you have two options: make your payment with paypal using a verified billing and shipping address or have someone within our service area place your order for you within the united states using a credit card with a us billing address. you can either collect the product if you are going to be in the country, or have it shipped to you. unfortunately, we will not be able to handle any of the international export and shipping process. place an order from outside our service area by contacting customer care. you will be entirely responsible for all shipping, customs, and duties that may apply. we are also unable to provide any broker or expert services or paperwork. all payments must be made in the form of a wire transfer, a cleared check, or a cashier's check. if you would like to place an order this way, please call customer care at (310) 343-4099 and speak to a representative who can help you with our international processing. fedex may have international shipping for the country in which you reside. please contact fedex at (800) 463-3339 for information. please remember: we do not accept international credit cards from outside of the usa. once the product leaves our warehouse, there can be no returns for any reason. our meltable products policy still applies. some products may melt in transit depending on the weather, but we will not be able to resend products. timely delivery we cannot issue credits or refunds for orders not delivered on specific dates unless (1) you notified us that you needed the order by a certain date and (2) the order is shipped via fedex/ups overnight or fedex/ups 2 day. because delivery times for orders shipped by ground delivery methods vary from state to state, no guarantees regarding delivery dates can be made. if you absolutely need your products on a certain day, please let us know and we will do our best to advise you regarding the most appropriate delivery option. candy warehouse is not responsible and cannot provide refunds for delays outside our control including "acts of god," such as inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, and third-party carrier delays. warm weather/summer shipping (no refunds for melted products) please click on the following link regarding our warm weather/summer shipping policies. onward shipping protection please click the following link to learn more about our onward shipping protection, listed under the shipping questions section. our guarantee if you purchase onward, choose expedited shipping to a valid address with someone available to receive it, and your candy still melts, we’ll refund the melted items—but we do not offer reshipments. candy warehouse footer menu about us candy elves & friends clean and tidy warehouse candy ambassador candy warehouse reviews fundraise with candy warehouse recognition site map b2b login
