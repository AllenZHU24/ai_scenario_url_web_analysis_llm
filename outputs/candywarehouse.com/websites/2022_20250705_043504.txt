therefore, their shipping costs will not represent a large percentage of their total order cost. sweets, for better or for worse, outweigh the competition!address corrections and derlivery interceptsthe ups charge for an address correction is $16.40 per package. if you enter your address incorrectly when placing an order and ups bills us for address correction costs, we will in turn charge your credit card for all associated ups fees. if you change your mind about an order after it has already shipped from our warehouse and you would like to re-route the package(s) back to candywarehouse.com, the ups charge for a delivery intercept is $16.00 per package. we will automatically bill all associated ups fees to your credit card.service areas – domestic & internationalat this time we do not ship our products to countries outside of the united states.please note our website only accepts online orders placed within the usa (e.g., you are traveling in london and want to place an online order to be shipped to your home in new york, our system will not accept this order).if you would like to purchase products from a non-us location, you have two options:make your payment with paypal using a verified billing and shipping address or have someone within our service area place your order for you within the united states using a credit card with a us billing address. you can either collect the product if you are going to be in the country, or have it shipped to you. unfortunately, we will not be able to handle any of the international export and shipping process.place an order from outside our service area by contacting customer care. you will be entirely responsible for all shipping, customs, and duties that may apply. we are also unable to provide any broker or expert services or paperwork. all payments must be made in the form of a wire transfer, a cleared check, or a cashier's check. if you would like to place an order this way, please call customer care at (310) 343-4099 and speak to a representative who can help you with our international processing.ups may have international shipping for the country in which you reside. please contact ups at 1-800-782-7892 for information.please remember:we do not accept international credit cards from outside of the usa.once the product leaves our warehouse, there can be no returns for any reason.our meltable products policy still applies. some products may melt in transit depending upon the weather, but we will not be able to resend products.timely deliverywe cannot issue credits or refunds for orders not delivered on specific dates unless (1) you notified us that you needed the order by a certain date and (2) the order is shipped via ups overnight or ups 2 day. because delivery times for orders shipped by ground delivery methods vary from state to state, no guarantees regarding delivery dates can be made. if you absolutely need your products on a certain day, please let us know and we will do our best to advise you regarding the most appropriate delivery option.candywarehouse is not responsible and cannot provide refunds for delays outside our control including "acts of god," such as inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, and third-party carrier delays.warm weather/summer shipping (no refunds for melted products)please click on the following link regarding our warm weather/summer shipping policies.our guaranteeif you take our recommended precautions – purchase insulated boxes and select an expedited shipping method delivered to a valid business address where someone is there to receive the package on the first attempt, and if your candy still melts, we will provide a refund for those melted items. but sorry, we will not reship items that have melted in transit. back to top sign up for special offers and delicious candy! follow candy warehouseinstagramfacebooktwitteryoutubepinterestcandy warehouseabout uslocationsleadership teamclean and tidy warehousesweet storiesweb accessibilitycustomer careshipping policyfaqscontact uscheck order statusreturn policyresourcescandy blogcorporate giftscandy shelf lifewedding candycandy machineseasonal candyparty suppliessnacksmanufacturerstoyslocationslong beach candy store 2520 mira mar ave. long beach, ca 90815 310-343-4099contact us call email privacy policy|terms of use|sitemap copyright © 1998-2022. all rights reserved. candywarehouse.com, inc. - bulk candy store
