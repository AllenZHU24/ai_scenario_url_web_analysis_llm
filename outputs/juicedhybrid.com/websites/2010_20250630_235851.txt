"just drive it !" once the heater warms up, resist the temptation to turn up the fan-speed on too high. that will actually decrease the potential heat. air blasting over the fins of the core too quickly prevents the opportunity to absorb as much heat as possible. slower air doesnt. in other words, don't exceed the medium speed setting. 12-volt jumping if the 12-volt auxiliary battery is ever drained completely, you can jump it similar to a traditional vehicle. with the prius off (hybrid system & lights), connect the positive-cable to the jump-start terminal (within the black plastic fuse-box, under the prius hood) then to the positive-terminal on the 12-volt battery of the supplying vehicle (as it is running). next, connect the negative-cable to the negative-terminal on the 12-volt battery of the supplying vehicle. then the other end of the negative-cable can be connected to an unpainted metal component under the hood; a very good place for this is the support attaching the engine & motor to the body of the vehicle in the front driver's side corner under the prius hood. at this point, start the hybrid system. when "ready" appears on the prius speedometer cluster, you should then disconnect the cables following the opposite order they were connected. for safety information, greater detail, and illustrations, please refer to your owner's manual. a very simple way to confirm you have a good electrical connection before attempting to start is to just turn on the ceiling light. if it illuminates brightly, you know that the supply coming from the donor vehicle is sufficient to successfully jump the prius. if the light is dim, the connection is bad and you must fix it before proceeding. prius user-guide 2 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 shutdown off confirm use the remote or push a door-button (or the one on the hatch) when leaving your prius. that will confirm that all the doors really did get shut tightly and the power for the hybrid system is off. if you don't, the 12-volt auxiliary battery may get drained completely or the alarm might not be able to protect the car. whirring sound there is a small electric-pump that pumps 3 liters of coolant into a thermal container (to keep it hot) every time you turn the hybrid system power off. when the power is turned back on, the coolant is pump back into the engine. this process reduces emissions, by achieving warm-up much faster than with an engine that would normally have to heat itself up. this process also helps to reduce wear & tear on the engine. cruise-control 24 mph minimum slowing down to less than 24 mph (39 km/h) will cause the cruise-control "resume" memory to reset. so if you have to slow down or stop, you'll need to set the speed again. mpg some owners have observed an increase in mpg from using the cruise-control, others have not. results vary depending on your particular driving habits and road conditions. stealth if you don't have a sensitive enough foot but would still like to enjoy stealth driving on a light traffic road, just set the cruise-control. this can be done all the way up to 42 mph (68 km/h) on flat or declining terrain without making the engine startup. smoooooth the cvt (continuously variable transmission, "planetary" type) makes the cruise-control in prius remarkably smooth. you'll notice the "no shifting" characteristic of the drive when going up hills and accelerating aggressively. many consider this smoothness as a luxury feature. neutral no engine to shift into neutral and keep it there without any chance of the engine starting, do the following: 1. insert the fob (not necessary if you have se/ss). 2. without stepping on the brake pedal, press the "power" button twice. 3. use the lever to shift in the neutral position. prius user-guide 3 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 reverse beeper disable some people find the reverse beeper distracting. although there isn't a method to change the repetitive beeping to just a short warning, there is a way to disable it completely. to do that, carefully follow these steps: 1) switch to the odometer/trip value to display "odo" by pushing the "odo trip" button shown in the lower-right corner of the photo below. if the speedometer-cluster was already showing "odo", make sure to cycle thru each option back to "odo" again. 2) power off (push the "power" button). 3) power on (push the "power" button again). 4) within 6 seconds of powering back on, push & hold the button for "odo" for a minimum of 10 seconds. 5) while still holding the button for "odo", shift into "r" (reverse), then to "p" (park). 6) "b-on" should display on the odometer/trip-meter now. push the "odo trip" button to switch the mode to "b-off", as shown here: 7) power off (push the "power" button). thats it! the beep should now be disabled. note #1: if the sequence above failed, it may have due to the "odo" setting not having been visible recently. in that case, all you have to do is drive with it that way for a few miles. the next time you try to disable the beeper, the process should work. note #2: if you ever disconnect the 12-volt auxiliary battery from the system (or drain it dead), you may have to repeat the disable process again. prius user-guide 4 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 hybrid driving from a stop the gasoline engine is most efficient when running around 70% maximum. so if you can't press lightly enough on the pedal to accelerate using only electricity, go ahead and press a little harder than usual. that brisk (but not aggressive) increase in speed will save a small amount of gas, resulting in an overall efficiency gain. climbing hills the hybrid system has 2 electric motors. when you encounter a large hill, those motors are automatically taken advantage of. the gasoline engine will rev to its most efficient high-power rpm. that provides thrust directly to the tires, generates electricity for the motor, and recharges the battery-pack all at the same time. so to the surprise of many new owners, large hills dont drain the system. youll still have plenty of reserve power available when you reach the top. on the highway just like with traditional vehicles, efficiency drops the faster you drive on the highway. 60 mph (96 km/h) is more efficient than 70 mph (113 km/h). speeding up to 75 mph (121 km/h), you'll observe mpg drop even more. it pays to drive slower. without the pack the electric motor doesn't actually need electricity from the battery-pack. the gasoline engine creates electricity immediately while you drive. so quite frequently, on the multi-display you'll see that the motor is being fed directly from the engine and the battery-pack isn't even being used. and sometimes, while both the engine and motor are providing thrust, the engine will also recharge the battery-pack at the same time. a/c instead at highway speeds, using the a/c (air-conditioner, cold setting) or vent to remain cool will likely result in slightly higher mpg than having the windows open. cruising a beneficial technique for efficient cruising is to feather the accelerator pedal at particular times. learning to do this is simple and will quickly become second nature with very little practice. (in fact, you may already have that foot control if you in-line skate or bicycle occasionally.) to do it, just lightly reduce pressure on the accelerator-pedal whenever you encounter a section of road thats perfectly flat or has a slight decline. the mpg indicator will sometimes jump all the way to the +100 mark, even though your speed ends up dropping only 1 mph. then lightly push the accelerator-pedal to efficiently regain that speed afterward. overall, mpg will climb a little bit when each time you do that. youll end up taking advantage of the hybrid design. changes in the road pitch naturally cause changes in speed anyway. using the multi-display and large digital speedometer helps you discover when gains from that are possible. brakes regenerator when you reduce pressure on the accelerator-pedal or use the brake-pedal, excess speed turns a motor, causing regeneration of electricity to recharge the battery-pack. the regenerator takes advantage of the kinetic energy that would have otherwise been lost. the brake pads & shoes are not used as much as in a traditional vehicle. this not only makes the prius more efficient, it also indicates the brakes will last longer. prius user-guide 5 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 stealth driving engine off while the gasoline engine is off and youre driving using just battery power, the mode youre in is called "stealth" (since movement is completely silent). invoking "stealth" is easy once the engine has warmed up (and you aren't running the a/c or heater too heavily). while driving, just find a street section without any inclines then lift your foot from the accelerator-pedal. the engine will shut off within a few moments. once it does, lightly place your foot back on the accelerator-pedal to continue driving with only electricity. another way to invoke stealth is to just stop completely, that will make the engine shut off. up to 42 mph the 50 kw electric motor is designed to propel the prius up to 42 mph (68 km/h). it takes a steady foot though. slower speeds, like 35 mph (56 km/h) and 30 mph (48 km/h), are easier. beyond that maximum speed or in conditions when additional power is needed, the motor works in combination with the gasoline engine. though, you will discover above 42 mph (68 km/h) that there are times when the engine will spin (pistons in motion) without any fuel being consumed; it is a normal function of the planetary-cvt. acceleration accelerating in "stealth" can be very slow. also using the gasoline engine is both quicker and (surprisingly) more efficient, so don't be afraid to consume a little bit of gas. remember that even if you use the battery and get "+100 mpg", the engine must run later to recharge it. so short-term gains may actually result in an overall loss. a/c & heater only the lowest setting for the air-conditioner & heater work in "stealth". higher settings and airflow durations longer than a minute or two will require the gasoline engine to run. be careful ! be careful while driving in "stealth", especially in parking lots. some people use only their ears to verify that it's safe, not their eyes! so having a car that's completely silent means you'll probably have someone step out in front of it without even realizing youre driving right at him or her. "b" mode on/off anytime you can engage or disengage engine-braking at anytime while driving. engine-braking avoid using this mode unless absolutely necessary, since it will cause mpg to drop. there is no charging benefit over regular braking either. the "b" mode works like an exhaust brake on a large truck (except, it's totally silent). the engine is used to slow down the vehicle, allowing you to reduce reliance on the regular brakes. so for steep declines, like driving down a mountain, it's a great way to avoid overheating caused by friction from the brake drums & shoes. winter slowing a special use of "b" is the ability to shift into it on-the-fly without having to take your eyes off the road. finding yourself taking a turn on snow or ice a little bit too fast, you'll discover "b" does an absolutely fantastic job of slowing the car down enough to retain traction without any risk whatsoever of the wheels slipping from braking too hard... since you aren't using the brakes at all. prius user-guide 6 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 mpg measurement lifetime lifetime is the most useful measurement. total miles driven, divided by total gallons consumed, informs you how efficiently the car has performed overall. tank tank is the measurement between each fill up. you press the reset button when the tank is full. the results are informative, but not perfectly accurate. in cold weather, the bladder inside the gas tank shrinks. this reduces the overall capacity making the "full" level variable. also, "full" can be misrepresented if the pump doesn't shut off at the proper time. these factors make calculations based on fill-up less accurate. trip trip is mostly for fun, since a multitude of variables can affect the measurement to a single destination. watch the 5-minute summary segments shown on the multi-display. remember though, if you were to start a drive downhill, with a tail wind, a warm engine, a fully charged battery-pack, and a warm outside temperature, the mpg would be very impressive for that particular trip. but then if the return trip back was uphill, against the wind, with a cold engine, a drained battery-pack, and a cold outside temperature, the mpg would appear very disappointing. in summary, trip results can vary greatly. the overall average is what really matters. sudden drop tire pressure may have dropped. for every 10 f degrees colder, pressure will automatically drop 1 psi. verify you still have as much air in the tires as you think they do. increased use of the heater or air-conditioner (which includes the defroster) will force the engine to run more often. try a less demanding setting. when the temperature drops below freezing, you may notice the engine has to run quite a bit longer to warm up the catalytic-converter. this is to keep the prius emissions super-ultra low. avoid driving short trips; instead, take advantage of the time after warm up is complete by running several errands at once. tire break-in dont forget that new tires require a break-in period. before that the tire surface and tread edges will be rough, causing mpg to be lower than you expect. it takes about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) before enough wear (barely visible to a trained eye) occurs to allow less abrasive contact with the road. and since front tires wear more than those in the rear, expect another break-in period the first time the rear tires are rotated to the front. fortunately, that reduced mpg will only last a few hundred miles. increasing mpg driving brisk acceleration is an often misunderstood benefit. there's no need to hold back. a gasoline engine works more efficiently when running at higher rpm, about 70 percent of maximum. take advantage of that by getting to cruising speed quickly (but not aggressively, please drive safely). and remember, while the engine running it is also generating electricity for later use. coast whenever you have the opportunity. using the feather technique helps. by lifting your foot lightly from the accelerator-pedal, you can invoke an efficient computer-controlled glide without decelerating much at all (less than 1 mph). with good road conditions and a bit of practice, you'll find yourself doing this instinctively. look ahead . if you see a light turning red or a need to slow down in the distance, there's no reason to continue holding the accelerator-pedal. remove your foot and allow the generator to decelerate the prius. that will increase your mpg, charge the battery-pack, and prolong the life of your brakes. prius user-guide 7 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 tire care 42/40 psi (2.9/2.8 bar) is what many prius owners strongly recommend. the original tires for the classic (2001-2003) prius support a maximum cold pressure of 50 psi (3.4 bar), for the hsd (2004-2005) prius 44 psi (3.0 bar). so that pressure increase is well within the design specifications. many of the alternate tires available support a maximum cold pressure of 44 psi (3.0 bar) too. whatever you decide, just remember that low pressure results in a mpg drop and the tires wear out faster. tires will not bulge like in decades past; manufacturers provide much better quality now which maintains a flat contact surface all the way up to the maximum pressure. every 5,000 (8,000 km) the tires should be rotated, for best lifetime performance. rotation is preferred in a roll-back, roll-forward pattern. measuring the psi should be done only when the tires are cold, since driving heats up the air inside the tires making the results inaccurate... giving you the impression more pressure is higher than it really is. check often since temperature causing pressure to drop, 1 psi for every 10f degrees. air will naturally leak out from normal use too. on the highway just like with traditional vehicles, efficiency drops the faster you drive on a highway. 60 mph (96 km/h) is more efficient than 70 mph (113 km/h). speeding up to 75 mph (121 km/h), you'll observe mpg drop even more. it pays to drive slower (obey the speed-limit). think of it this way, pedaling a bicycle rapidly takes much more energy than pedaling at a moderate rate. a/c & heater minimal use is the key. using the heater or the a/c (which includes the defroster) on anything but a low setting may prevent the engine from shutting off. that will reduce mpg. so, try to avoid high demand use. fortunately, on the highway using the a/c is still more efficient than opening the windows. 87 octane gas prius was designed to run with 87 octane gasoline (85 in high altitudes). some owners have experimented with higher octanes, but found there wasn't any mpg improvement. also, bear in mind that higher octane gasoline may trigger an emission sensor alert. so just save money and continue using the less expensive 87 octane gas. engine warm-up short trips are horribly inefficient for all vehicles. prius is no exception; however, its far more noticeable since the multi-display provides immediate feedback to actually show you the lower mpg. the efficiency benefits of the system are not utilized until after warm-up is complete... that's engine, emissions system, and tires. so try to run several errands at once to take advantage of an already warmed up car. pzev (partial zero emission vehicle) is what prius strives to remain whenever active, even during warm-up. that means the catalytic-converter must be kept hot even if that requires using some gas to do it. fortunately, you still get better than average mileage, even if the engine doesn't shut off right away. external loads hitch racks & roof carriers cause a lot of aerodynamic drag. so, expect a mpg drop when you use one. "b" mode avoid using this mode unless absolutely necessary; it will cause mpg to drop. 5w-30 oil 5w-30 oil is strongly recommended (real or synthetic). if a service person puts 10w-30 in by mistake, you may complain since it will negatively impact your mpg slightly and may affect performance in below freezing temperatures. the text on the engine oil cap clearly states 5w-30 should be used. prius user-guide 8 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 synthetic oil owners have observed minor mpg improvements by switching to synthetic oil. plus, since it protects the engine better than real oil and makes extremely cold startups even easier, switching from real oil should be a simple choice. oil level too much oil can decrease mpg. verify the level is never above the max mark on the dipstick. unfortunately, overfilling is a problem commonly overlooked. oil change services routinely pump oil from large barrels, rather than using quart-size bottles. that makes overfilling very easy to do. taking a moment afterward to check afterward is truly beneficial. ymmv "your mileage may vary" that simple statement about the epa ratings shown on the new vehicle window sticker is often overlooked, yet it makes a significant difference depending on the type of driving you do. reading this quote provided by the epa about prius reveals why: "actual mileage will vary with options, driving conditions, driving habits and vehicle's condition. results reported to epa indicate that the majority of vehicles with these estimates will achieve between 51 and 69 mpg in the city and between 43 and 59 on the highway." epa tests are generalizations (performed under ideal conditions) intended to make vehicle comparisons easier, not to specify what mpg you will actually get. in fact, they rarely reflect the mpg in real-world driving experiences. the following explains how those tests are performed... notice how results can be quite a bit lower if you live in the north or if you drive fast: the fuel economy estimates are based on results of tests required by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa). these tests are used to certify that vehicles meet the federal emissions and fuel economy standards. manufacturers test pre-production prototypes of the new vehicle models and submit the test results to epa. epa re-tests about 10% of the tested vehicles to confirm manufacturer's results in epa's lab. the vehicles are driven by a professional driver under controlled laboratory conditions, on an instrument similar to a treadmill. these procedures ensure that each vehicle is tested under identical conditions; therefore, the results can be compared with confidence. there are two different fuel economy estimates for each vehicle in the fuel economy guide, one for city driving and one for highway driving. to generate these two estimates, separate tests are used to represent typical everyday driving in a city and in a rural setting. two kinds of engine starts are used: the cold start, which is similar to starting a car in the morning after it has been parked all night; and the hot start, similar to restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up, driven, and stopped for a short time. the test used to determine the city fuel economy estimate simulates an 11-mile, stop-and-go trip with an average speed of 20 miles per hour (mph). the trip takes 31 minutes and has 23 stops. about 18 percent of the time is spent idling, as in waiting at traffic lights or in rush hour traffic. the maximum speed is 56 mph. the engine is initially started after being parked overnight. vehicles are tested at 68 f to 86 f ambient temperature. the test to determine the highway fuel economy estimate represents a mixture of "non-city" driving. segments corresponding to different kinds of rural roads and interstate highways are included. the test simulates a 10-mile trip and averages 48 mph. the maximum speed is 60 mph. the test is run with the engine warmed up and has little idling time and no stops (except at the end of the test). note : to make the numbers in the fuel economy guide more useful for consumers, epa adjusts these laboratory test results to account for the difference between controlled laboratory conditions and actual driving on the road. the laboratory fuel economy results are adjusted downward to arrive at the estimates in the fuel economy guide and on the labels seen on new cars, light trucks, and vans. the city estimate is lowered by 10% and the highway estimate by 22% from the laboratory test results. experience has proven that these adjustments make the mileage estimates in the fuel economy guide correspond more closely to the actual fuel economy realized by the average driver. also note: the epa tests are all performed with 100% gasoline, summer-formula. owners using e10 (that's 10% ethanol, 90% gasoline) will observe efficiency about 3.4% lower than with 100% gasoline. and during the winter months in the united states, the refining formula for gasoline is altered to help reduce emissions. as a result, winter-formula is less efficient, making mpg lower than with summer-formula. for more information, please refer to... http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/info.shtml measurement the multi-display averages optimistically, so it will usually read about 2 mpg too high for most owners. the "bladder effect" (caused by the bladder in the gas tank shrinking due to temperatures below freezing), which is very noticeable in the spring & fall, causes the readout value and manual calculations to vary greatly for individual measurements. averaging several fill up amounts documented at the gas station will provide the actual mpg you've been getting. for an example of how to do this, refer to this webpage... http://john1701a.com/prius/prius-data.htm prius user-guide 9 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 break-in for the first 200 miles (322 km): - avoid rapid deceleration (hard stops) - avoid high speeds (more than 70 mph, 113 km/h) for the first 600 miles (966 km): - avoid rapid acceleration - avoid racing (high rpm) the engine after roughly 10,000 miles (16,100 km): - enjoy a mpg increase, from the moving parts having loosened even at 30,000 miles (48,300 km): - you may continue observe minor mpg increases as the car ages radio channel scan press the " scan" button by the radio tuner knob. it will begin scanning for radio channels. when it finds a station, a few seconds will play, then it will automatically scan for the next. press the "scan" button again when you want the scanning to stop. if you press then hold the "scan" button, only your preset radio channels will be scanned. cd cd change holding the track-change button on the steering-wheel, rather than just quickly pressing it, will cause the cd to be changed instead. audio buttons audio button pressing the "audio" button next to the multi-display will reveal the radio preset or cd control screen, depending on what is playing at that moment. pressing the "audio" button another time will return you to the screen you were previously viewing, "consumption" or "energy monitor" or "navigation". mode button pressing the "mode" button on the steering-wheel toggles between the am, fm1, fm2, and cd modes of the audio system. holding the "mode" button for a few seconds will toggle the power for the audio system on & off. prius user-guide 10 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 nurturing filling the gas tank fill speed it is best to use the slowest setting (the farthest latch on the pump-handle); otherwise, the pump could shut off prematurely giving you an inaccurate indication of "full". topping off don't! once the pump automatically stops, don't trying squeezing any more gas into the tank. the bladder will stretch, but it may spit gas back out if you force too much. also, pumping too much gas into the tank will result in gas filling up the vapor-capture canister. that defeats part of the emissions system. so if you want your prius to remove the cleanest possible, avoid ever doing this. 87 octane gas prius was designed to run with 87 octane gasoline (85 in high altitudes). several owners have experimented with 90 & 93 octane; however, there wasn't any improvement to mpg. since engine knocking is non-existent with prius, there's no benefit in that respect either. additionally, higher octane may trigger an emission sensor alert. therefore, save some money by using 87 octane. low-sulfur gas without the loss of performance or power, low sulfur gasoline helps to reduce emissions by preventing efficiency loss within the catalytic-converter (a pollution control device) due to sulfur build up. this also extends the life of the emission components. all gasoline sold in the united states is mandated to be low-sulfur by january 2006. 10% ethanol 90% gasoline mixed with 10% ethanol, better known as e10, will not harm any part of the prius fuel or emission system. owners in the metro area of minnesota, where e10 is required by law, have used this type of fuel in their prius for many years without experiencing any problems at all. so there is no need for concern. empty don't ever run out of gas! not having the engine available makes driving a prius using just electricity very risky. without gasoline it is very easy to push the motor & battery-pack beyond the tolerances they were designed to operate. the motor is never supposed to exceed 42 mph (68 km/h) all by itself and the battery-pack is never supposed to be fully depleted. also, without gas there's no way to prevent certain mechanical & electrical components from overheating. since prius can go quite a bit further between fill-ups than most vehicles, there's really no reason you should ever run out of gas anyway. but if you do, drive very slowly and just enough to get out of harm's way. another gauge when there is less than half a tank of gas remaining, the gas gauge is less accurate due to the flexible nature of the bladder within. a helpful measurement alternative is to base refill timing on the mileage you drive. just reset one of the three odometers (a, b, or the one on the multi-display) every time you get gas. 450 miles (725 km) in the summer and 400 miles (644 km) in the winter is a good distance to start with. you'll quickly figure out what works well for your particular needs. prius user-guide 11 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 emission bladder inside the gas tank is a flexible bladder. it contracts and expands to fill the empty void that would otherwise be filled with vapor as gasoline is consumed. the reduction of vapor emissions helps to keep prius extraordinarily clean. overfilling should be avoided, since adding gas after the pump automatically stops can create pressure within the bladder. this could cause gas to be expelled afterward. so just don't top off. capacity reduces during the winter since cold temperatures cause the bladder to contract, up to 1.5 gallons (5.7 liters) in extreme conditions (below 0f / -18c degrees). that means you'll have to fill up sooner. but when temperatures are that dangerously low, you should really fill up at the halfway point anyway. gas cap & door twist the cap until it clicks. if it is not tightly secured, you may trigger an alert from the emission sensor. after all, prius wouldn't be so clean if vapor were allowed to leak out. in the event of an alert, turn off the prius and tighten the cap. normal status should return after you restart. tuck the tether holding the cap to the car into the interior. simply allowing it to be pushed by the door may cause a tangle making the door hard to open later. lubricate the hinge. after extended exposure to dust, sand, and salt, the spring may struggle to open the door due to the hinge being dry. adjust the latch. its possible to accidentally bend it. too much can make the door difficult to open. you may need to straighten it. multi-display care cleaning the best way to remove fingerprints from the touch-screen is actually simpler that some owners realize. you don't need a special solvent or material. just a plain old soft cotton fabric, like an old clean t-shirt or handkerchief, and some purified drinking water is all you need. also, make sure to only clean when the multi-display is off (or even better, the prius itself is off). this will make the fingerprints easy to see and will prevent the "reset" button from accidentally being pushed. long-term storage less than 3 weeks nothing is needed, at room temperature. the engine should startup just fine. be aware that this duration can be shortened by the age of the auxiliary-battery and the extreme cold. more than 3 weeks if you have ss/se, press the button underneath the steering-wheel to disable it. the proximity detector actually only causes a continuous draw from that 12-volt auxiliary battery for the first 10 days of storage, then it automatically disables itself. but it is better to just do it yourself immediately. if you have an alarm system, it is best to manually disconnect the 12-volt auxiliary battery passenger side in the hatch area. with it disconnected, that continuous drain will be eliminated. (make note of the radio buttons you have programmed, since you'll need to manually restore them after reconnecting the 12-volt auxiliary battery.) draining the 201.6-volt battery-pack while in long-term storage is never a concern. when you shut off the prius, an electric-relay automatically deactivates to cut the connection to the hybrid system. so it isnt even connected to the rest of the system until you turn the key again. prius user-guide 12 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 polishing owner tests "nu finish" has worked well. the great polished look lasts for about 6 months, enough to get through an entire winter. but when you wipe the dried residue off, it actually leaves lightly faded streaks at first. don't let that deter you. it disappears, leaving a protective layer after a few days. tire care to prevent accelerated wear and maximize miles before replacement, follow these suggestions: monthly checking at the very least , check your tires monthly. every two weeks is better. pressure loss is normal and especially rapid when temperatures drop. uneven wear is an indication that either youve been driving with tires below the minimum psi or balancing/alignment is required. also, dont forget about checking the spare tire in the trunk too. front bias prius is a little heavier in front. to properly support that weight load, you must make sure the front tires have 2 psi more in them than the ones in the rear. turning never turn the wheels unless they're rolling. that causes unnecessary wear, just as with other vehicles. the electric-steering is so powerful, you can't feel the friction caused by turning. but your tires can. so, make sure the wheels are moving before you turn them. rotation every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) the tires should be rotated, for best lifetime performance. rotation should be in a "roll-back, cross-forward" pattern. (that's front tires to the rear without switching sides, and rear tires to front switching sides.) lug nuts when initially tightening the lug nuts after having put a wheel back on and when you retorque them after having driven around 100 miles, make certain the pressure you use is 76 ft-lb (103nm). alignment 0.05 degrees of toe in each side, for a total of 0.10 degrees. if steering feels like it wanders at high speeds, it's probably because the alignment isn't adjusted correctly. remember, "within factory-specified tolerance" is an answer you don't have to accept from a service provider; you can insist that alignment be adjusted to this "exact" setting. psi minimum 35/33 psi (2.4/2.3 bar) is the psi for the prius tires (noted on the driver's door-jam of the car itself). 42/40 psi (2.9/2.8 bar) is what many prius owners recommend for optimum performance. for maximum performance, use a pressure of 44 psi (3.0 bar). whatever you decide, just remember that low pressure results in lower mpg drop and a shorter tire life. note 1: measuring psi should always be done when the tires are cold, since driving heats up tires making the results inaccurate due to the air inside expanding (which creates a false impression of higher pressure). note 2: for every 10 f degrees colder, pressure will automatically drop 1 psi. the reverse is true too. so in the spring, carefully monitor pressure to ensure it doesn't exceed the maximum as the temperature increases. prius user-guide 13 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 psi convenience tire pressure needs to be routinely checked (for all vehicles, not just prius). temperature drops cause psi to decrease. heat caused by driving increases psi, making measurements inaccurate until cool. mpg & safety are directly dependent on properly maintained psi. prius owners have found a way to make this simple: use a cordless inflator. cordless inflators cost about $40 (as shown below). they are small & powerful, allowing you to increase psi in the convenience & comfort of your own garage when the tires are still cool. as an added bonus, the battery in the cordless inflator can be used as a portable12-volt power-supply to plug your automotive accessories into. some even offer additional features, like a built-in light and even the ability to jump-start a vehicle. make sure to purchase a high-quality tire-gauge. for about $30 (as show above), youll find that it is both easier to hold and easier to read than a less expensive one. that price will also deliver a 0.5 psi accuracy that you can depend on for many years and a tough case to protect it. prius user-guide 14 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 upgrade tires hsd prius comes with standard, run-of-the-mill tires. in other words, they are fairly typical. so some owners are pleased with them and others choose to upgrade. disclaimer: the ideas, suggestions, and opinions offered here have not been endorsed by the manufacturer of those specific components or toyota motor corporation. any harm or damage that may result from the application of or the following of any ideas, suggestions, or opinions contained in this document is the sole responsibility of the individual that applied or followed said ideas, suggestions or opinions. the authors of this document hereby declare that they cannot and will not be held liable, in any fashion, for the content or the use of this information. psi hsd prius is average weight, exactly what you'd expect a vehicle that size to weigh. it does not need special tires, since there is nothing extra to support. (in other words, xl rated tires are not required.) like with many vehicles, a minimum of 35 psi (2.4 bar) is required for tire-pressure. less than that will cause premature wear. 42/40 psi (2.9/2.8 bar) is what many prius owners recommend, since it increases the handling abilities and allows the tread to last its longest. (that's 42 front & 40 back, since a 2 psi bias is required for the front tires.) the standard tires, as well as many other tires, support a maximum cold pressure of 44 psi (3.0 bar). so using 42/40 is no big deal. in fact, some owners even use 44/42 psi (3.0/2.9 bar). lrr hsd prius comes with standard tires. there are not lrr (low rolling resistance), as many people believe. if you desire, you may switch to lrr tires. that will maximize mpg, offering a minor improvement over most standard tires. treadwear 460 is the treadwear rating for the standard hsd prius tires. that's what many typical family vehicle tires come with. 800 is what you'll find on the ultra-long-life tires. so there is an obvious upgrade opportunity, if you want a set tires to last as long as possible. the rating number represents the wear resistance of the tire. it does not correlate directly with the amount of mileage you'll be able to drive. don't rely exclusively on this value when selecting a tire. check the warranty, it will usually state an approximate distance expectation. revs revs (revolutions per mile) indicate the precise "rolling" size of the tire. this measurement is needed since not all tires with the same specification are actually the same. 855 is the revs value for the standard hsd prius tires. when selecting an alternate, a number very close to that is required to insure the speedometer and odometer remain accurate. (being off by a small amount is acceptable since that value will change as tread wears down anyway.) size 185 / 65 r15 is the standard size tire for hsd prius. you'll find a wide variety of choices available for this size. wider sizes may also be used. but keep in mind that larger widths will reduce your traction on snow. a normal tire is better for digging through down to the road itself. prius user-guide 15 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 original tire goodyear integrity hsd prius comes with these tires standard. they are sometimes referred to as oem (original equipment manufacturer) tires. 185 / 65 r15 44 psi (3.0 bar) maximum 1168 lbs.

locations when the back seats are up, simply raising a headrest to reveal metal rods that can be used. when the back seats are folded down, you may use the latch-loop that is normally used to secure the seat in place. cargo nets there are two types available. one lays flat (horizontal), connecting to each of the metal-rings. you just slip cargo underneath it to keep the cargo in place. the other is upright (vertical), connecting to the 2 metal-rings closest to the hatch and 2 connector-point which you add by drilling a simple hole in a location close to the window. this type works well for cargo such as grocery bags. prius user-guide 29 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 hidden release from inside the hidden storage area underneath the floorboard, remove the tiny black panel on the side closest to the hatch, and then poke your finger through that hole into the metal casing. there's a smooth tiny metal latch there. (toyota definitely wanted to make that inaccessible from outside.) pulling it up pops the hatch open. with the hidden storage area removed, the photo below shows the exact location of that metal latch, as indicated by the yellow " v " mark. this close-up of the photo above makes the (brass colored) release latch easier to see. prius user-guide 30 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 side mirrors blind-spot as with most all vehicles, prius has a blind-spot immediately to the left-rear of the driver. the solution to that is carefully aiming the mirror on the side. you can also add a blind-spot mirror to it, the very same way as with other vehicles. the photo above shows a blind-spot mirror installed, outside the driver-side door. (theres just an adhesive sticker on the back of it. so installation only takes a moment.) the upper-right corner is the least intrusive location, since you wont normally see a vehicle positioned there anyway. it is recommended that you purchase two (one for each side of the car) made from high-quality hard plastic. the cost is around $6 for a set of that nicer type. that makes it easier to see fine detail and more resistant to water spots. in fact, youll find that the plastic stays cleaner in the winter than the glass of the big mirror. prius user-guide 31 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 transmission cvt type " planetary" is the type of cvt that prius uses. it has nothing in common with the other type of cvt currently available, called " cone & belt". design technically, prius really doesnt have a transmission since nothing ever shifts. there are no gears. there are only power-carriers. all they do is rotate, and they are permanently engaged. operation the physical components within the "planetary" cvt bare a striking resemblance to those within a differential (the power-transfer mechanism found on all vehicles). in fact, they even serve the same purpose. lifetime due to the fact that the "planetary" cvt is nearly identical to that of a differential, the expectation is that it will last just as long too. so you can confidently predict it will last the entire lifetime of the vehicle. information sources toyota website information directly from toyota itself is available here... http://www.toyota.com/prius toyota online repair manual access & downloading for $10 per day at... http://techinfo.toyota.com toyota manuals available via credit-card from 1-800-622-2033  2004 prius repair manual, volume 1: rm1075u1  2004 prius repair manual, volume 2: rm1075u2  2004 prius repair manual, volume 3: rm1075u3  2004 prius electrical wiring diagram: wed555u  prius new car features, 2004: ncf255u coastal electronic technologies, inc. http://www.coastaletech.com a source for purchasing many innovative after-market prius accessories. prius user-guide 32 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 recent news http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&lr=&ie=iso-8859-1&q=prius&sa=n&tab=wn enthusiast forums here are two very information forum where you can participate in online discussions: http://priuschat.com http://priusonline.com owner webpages youll find a variety of prius owner webpages with photos here: http://john1701a.com/prius/owners/owner-index.htm yahoo groups there are many. these are the main groups: http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/toyota-prius http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/prius-2g http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/prius_technical_stuff yahoo searching on http://google.com use the following search key: "prius site:autos.groups.yahoo.com" add it in front of the term you wish to search for. for example, to search for " synthetic oil" enter the following text on google's website: "prius site:autos.groups.yahoo.com synthetic oil" graham's website http://home.earthlink.net/~graham1/prius/prius.htm an owners website that thoroughly documents many aspects of the prius. john1701a's website http://john1701a.com this is a very large prius owner website. as of 8/20/2005 the combined classic & hsd prius content available consisted of: 552 webpages, 1,275 digital photos, 940 offline-pages of blogs, 47 animations, 30 wallpapers, 13 spreadsheets with graphs, 26 documents, and 5 screen-savers, along with a few other prius related items. there's also nature gallery with 151 photos. prius user-guide 33 of 37 last updated: 8/20/2005 glossary abs anti-lock braking system a/c air-conditioning assist hybrid system with a small battery-pack and a single small electric-motor that provides peak power for the gasoline-engine during periods of acceleration. at-pzev advanced technology partial zero emission vehicle "b" gear engine braking, (it isn't actually a gear) when you shift the transmission to this setting the engine will be used to slow down the car, it works similar to an exhaust brake used on the large semi-trucks (except the one on prius is totally silent). c celsius, a measure of temperature, (c * 1.8) + 32 = f, -25°c = -13°f, -15°c = 5°f, -5°c = 23°f, 0°c = 32°f, 5°c = 41°f, 20°c = 68°f, 25°c = 77°f, 30°c = 86°f carb california air resources board, an agency dictating emissions requirements for cars sold in california.
