family. for the first time on a warbird, we’ve ditched the dimples and incorporated hex aerodynamics. when you throw in the new high powered core, it becomes the longest warbird we’ve ever made. the durable ionomer cover provides long-lasting playability and also helps increase the deep distance this ball delivers. people also liked callaway big bertha diablo golf balls from: $19.99 callaway big bertha diablo golf balls from: $19.99 description <p>quite simply, the results surprised even us. a golf ball this soft, and with this much feel, shouldn’t be able to go this far. the new big bertha diablo provides the best combination of distance and feel we could generate in a 2-piece golf ball. the new advanced high-resiliency core is soft for stealthy feel while also providing wicked distance. the soft ionomer cover with hex aerodynamics adds to the feel while also providing longer, more penetrating ball flight for added distance.</p> <ul> <li><strong>high-resiliency core</strong> - proprietary rubber formulation has higher resiliency to increase ball velocity across a wide range of swing speeds while also providing great feel. the advanced core reduces driver spin, tightening shot dispersion for better accuracy.</li> <li><strong>soft ionomer cover</strong> - durable design generates long drives and provides even longer playability.</li> <li><strong>hex
