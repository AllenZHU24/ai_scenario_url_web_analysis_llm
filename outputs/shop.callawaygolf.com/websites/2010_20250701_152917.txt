ball that delivers faster ball speeds. the refined hex aerodynamics pattern has been improved to add even more distance. this patented design breakthrough reduces drag and adds flight stability through every kind of wind condition, minimizing the wind’s effect on ball trajectory. the new urethane cover uses a proprietary blend to provide tour-level feel and control around the green with significantly improved durability. longer distance, better accuracy: a new, refined hex aerodynamics pattern with 6 sub-hex geometries increases distance by reducing drag and cutting through the wind with a stronger, more penetrating ball flight. faster ball speed: the higher-resiliency 2nd generation dual core construction increases ball speed for a wide range of swing speeds. control and spin: the soft urethane cover uses a new proprietary blend that plays softer, lasts longer and generates tour-level greenside spin. also available in high player number. people also liked callaway tour

description <p><strong>the longest stainless steel irons we&rsquo;ve ever created.</strong><br /> the diablo edge irons provide increased distance without compromising feel or performance. the lower, deeper center of gravity (cg) makes the sweet spot more accessible and is in line with where amateurs most commonly hit the ball on the clubface, generating longer, consistent distance and improved accuracy.</p> <ul> <li><strong>maximized distance</strong>: a lower, deeper cg is designed to make the sweet spot more accessible at lower impact locations. this generates longer, more consistent distance and improves accuracy for more greens in regulation.</li> <li><strong>set options</strong>: get more distance through the entire bag by opting for matched hybrids in the set where you begin to struggle with your irons.</li> <li><strong>solid impact sole</strong>: delivering smooth turf interaction, the sole is designed to mitigate the effects of heavy and thin shots and improve the impact location on the face for greater distance.</li> <li><strong>enhanced feel and performance</strong>: callaway golf core technologies like vft, s2h2, a 360-degree undercut channel and modified
