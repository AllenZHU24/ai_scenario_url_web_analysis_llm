please read these terms and conditions carefully. by accessing this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions below. these terms and conditions are subject to change without notice, from time to time in our sole discretion. we will notify you of amendments to these terms and conditions by posting them to this website. if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, please do not access this website. how the program works to participate, refer betabrand or a betabrand product to friends, family and colleagues by sending them a personal referral link through email, facebook, twitter or sharing the link directly with them. you have the opportunity to do that in various placements across the site (www.betabrand.com): through a permanent link in the header, after you have made a purchase (on the order success page or through a link in the order confirmation email). participating in the promotion does not require a purchase from betabrand and is valid for existing or new customers (each a “referring customer”). each new user (i.e. a user that has never made a purchase at betabrand.com or a betabrand retail store before and does not have an account at betabrand.com) that clicks on your personal referral link will receive a promotional offer of $15 that they can spend on their first purchase of $75 or more. the offer is not valid with any other offers or discounts. for each qualified purchase you will receive $15 (“referral reward”) that will be placed as loyalty credit in your account. a qualified referral purchase is defined as a purchase of $75 or more, made at betabrand.com or a betabrand retail store, by an individual who has not previously made a purchase at betabrand.com or a betabrand retail store and was not registered for an account prior to the referral. you will need an account in order to redeem your referral reward. if you don’t have an account you will have the opportunity to create one by clicking on a link that you can find on the welcome email when you first join the program. you can refer as many new users as you want. we reserve the right to cancel any referral rewards that we can identify they have been generated through abuse of the program, including but not limited to, posting on message boards or other online fora. if the referred new customer returns any of the items purchased causing the total value of their order to drop below $75 we reserve the right to cancel your referral reward. no cash value. betabrand referral credits are redeemable only for merchandise and in-store purchases at betabrand.com and the betabrand boutique in san francisco; they may not be redeemed for cash, and have no property or monetary value. betabrand loyalty referral credits are not available for purchase and may not be gifted, transferred, sold or assigned for use by another user. crowdfunding referrals you can also participate in our referral program by referring a product that is crowdfunded (http://www.betabrand.com/think-tank/crowdfunding.html). you can refer a crowdfunded product to as many friends, family and colleagues as you like, just as with regular product referrals. there are two ways to refer a crowdfunded project. you may refer a crowdfunded project via its product page. no funding of the project is required for this. you may also refer a crowdfunded project at the time of funding it. based on how the user refers (type i or ii) the referral reward is different. they get $15 for the referral of type i) and 10% off the funded price for every referral of type ii). in the latter case the user can eventually get the crowdfunded product for free if 10 friends fund the product through their link. if you refer the crowdfunded product via the product page, without funding it, you are eligible for the standard $15 referral credit when one your friends makes their first purchase of $75 through your personal referral link. you have the opportunity to refer a crowdfunded product from its product page by clicking on the referral prompt located on the page. if you refer the product at the time of funding it, you have the opportunity to get it for free if enough of the friends, family or colleagues you refer fund the same product before the end of the funding period. you receive an additional 10% off of the original price you funded the item for (the “funded price”), for each qualifying referral you drive until you can get the product for free. so, if you funded a product for $100, the first referral that makes a qualified purchase results in 10% off, or $10 off. the second referral that makes a qualified purchase will also result in 10% off the original, another $10 off. at the end of the funding period when capturing payments we reduce the original amount of the funded price we had on hold by the aggregate of the discounts to arrive at your purchase price. it is not required that the friends you refer the product to at the time of funding are new betabrand customers. when referring the product after funding, referred customers receive the same discount (“tier”) you (the original referrer)received at the time you funded the product independent of the current discount (“tier”) of the crowdfunded product. if a referred customer purchases the product through your personal referral link after the funding period has ended, you are not eligible for a referral reward. in the event the referred customer cancels their crowdfunded order we remove the referral reward from your account and it is not deducted from your funded price. fraudulent behavior betabrand reserves the right to cancel a referring customer’s loyalty credits if it determines in its sole discretion that the referring customer has violated these terms, including through any fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by referring fake people to betabrand, using false names, multiple identities, email accounts or email addresses, impersonating another person, or otherwise providing false or misleading information) or if betabrand terminates the referring customer’s account for any other reason. determination of referral eligibility and qualifying purchases, as well as any exceptions, are at the sole discretion of betabrand. betabrand reserves the right to verify and adjust credits at any time prior to or following posting and redemption. any other abuse of this offer, as determined by betabrand in its sole discretion, may result in the rescission of the referring customer’s referral credit and cancellation of the referred customer’s discounted order, may also result in ineligibility by one or both parties in this or future offers. additionally, abuse of this offer carries liability for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law and betabrand reserves their rights to exercise any and all legal recourse. sign in with... facebook do you have a password? no, i'm new here yes, i have a
