(an image isn’t required, but it helps!) tip: the most successful concepts tend to be those that solve a problem; betabrand fans want to see design ideas that make the everyday exceptional. build a following we’ll email you once your design idea is live on our site. then it's time to share it with friends, family, your dentist, random strangers, and everyone else. the more votes a concept gets — and the more engaged those voters are — the more likely it is to become a crowdfunding project. developing your concept for crowdfunding if your design idea is greenlighted for crowdfunding, we’ll get in touch asap to begin the development process. you can be as involved as you like, from choosing fabric to participating in the fittings! and if you don’t already have a prototype, we’ll make one in-house. finally, our creative team will develop a photo gallery and accompanying copy for your project. launching in crowdfunding your project has 30 days to reach its crowdfunding goal (goals vary by project). once it goes live on our site, we’ll alert your project followers as well as the betabrand community at large through email newsletters. but the more you promote your project, the better! (we’ll be happy to discuss promotion ideas with you.) what’s next? as soon as a project reaches its crowdfunding goal, our production team gets to work! we’ll do the heavy lifting; you just worry about how you’ll spend your 10% share. ready to get started? got a great idea to share with the world? give it a name (don’t worry, it can change), type it in the box below, and get ready for fame and fortune! post your idea see what we’ve crowdfunded here are the design ideas that betabrand fans have brought to life. needs your feedback pants to the 2nd power bam. for $88.20 $98.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: margie follow margie needs your feedback vivobarefoot fulham boots (men’s) yeah! for $166.50 $185.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: vivobarefoot follow vivobarefoot needs your feedback all-weather wedges (dusk) bam. for $115.20 $128.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: tiffany t. follow tiffany t. needs your feedback mountain hardwear atlas at pack (zinc) nice one! for $133.20 $148.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: mountain hardwear follow mountain hardwear needs your feedback all-weather wedges (onyx) again! for $115.20 $128.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: tiffany t. follow tiffany t. needs your feedback clowna sutra shirt yeah! for $61.20 $68.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: chris follow chris needs your feedback ross & snow shearling moto boots (black) alright! for $375.00 designer: ross & snow follow ross & snow needs your feedback galactic gastropod shirt bam. for $68.00 designer: margie follow margie needs your feedback shape & drape top (black) haduken! for $61.20 $68.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: bethany follow bethany needs your feedback blue cordillera shirt haduken! for $68.00 designer: tory sevas follow tory sevas needs your feedback 8-ounce travel dress great! for $106.20 $118.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: ayesha tellis follow ayesha tellis needs your feedback dress pant action pants (khaki) again! for $98.00 designer: mpg follow mpg needs your feedback big travel tote (black) woot! for $160.20 $178.00 (10% off) pre-order designer: tiffany t. follow tiffany t. needs your feedback purple-reign reversible smoking jacket keep going! for $218.00 designer: chris follow chris your cart - press escape to return to the menu. your cart is empty and sad shop now company info about us jobs at betabrand privacy policy terms of use customer service faq returns & exchanges shipping & pick-ups group discounts student discounts contact come say hi betabrand san francisco 780 valencia st. san francisco, ca 94110 mon-fri: 11-7 sat: 11-8 sun: 12-6 betabrand newsletter sign up for our newsletter and be the first to know about new products and discounts! subscribe follow us ©2010-2018 betabrand. all rights reserved. <iframe src="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=gtm-kdtx6r" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe> ?show / hide this help menu/focus on searchescclose carttabfocus next⇧ + tabfocus prevescclose cart×
