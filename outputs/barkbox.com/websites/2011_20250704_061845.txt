barkbox how it works for a good cause log in join now barkbox.com make your best friend happy faq general what is barkbox and who's behind it? barkbox is a new york city based subscription-commerce company serving dog owners and their four-legged friends every month. barkbox is from the minds of henrik werdelin/prehype, matt meeker, and carly strife. their dogs are hugo, cooper and roxy (from a local nyc rescue). who else is involved? barkbox has launched thanks to a bunch of awesome dog loving people. besides the founding team, dogs across the country should add these fine folks to their evening prayers; philip petersen and josh horn (design), martin laxman (illustrations), jordan orelli (prehype's hacker in residence), kika gilbert (copy) joseph mauriello and jamie kruger (frontend). what does "subscription-commerce" mean? good question. it's one of those fancy internet industry terms that's so popular it's been shortened to "subcom". as annoying as that sounds, it means we send your dog a box of goodies on a regular basis, and you, their owner, subscribe for that service. signing up how do i create a barkbox account? look up in the upper right corner for the link called "join". click that. select the size of your dog (for optimal gift selection). fill in the subscription information page and click the large "subscribe" button at the bottom. then add a bit of information about your dog, and you're ready to go. what payment options do i have? you can pay using visa, mastercard, american express, or discover. we do not accept checks, money orders, or the family housecat in trade. i just signed up for a barkbox subscription -- what will my dog receive? each month your dog will receive a box full of 4-8 goodies to enjoy. each box will include a different mix of goodies like bones, bully sticks, toys, treats, shampoos, hygiene products, food samples, and more. there's plenty in each box to discover what your dog really loves and wants more of in the future. shipping what are my shipping options? your shipping options are simple. if you order a box, we'll ship it. if you don't order a box, we won't ship it. we will usually ship via usps to keep the costs low for everyone, and it's pretty reliable. we might ship via fedex or ups in the future. it's ground shipping, so it should take 5-8 days to get there. where does barkbox ship to? we currently ship everywhere in the united states, and all us territories (you know who you are). sorry, we're not yet shipping outside the united states, giving the samwer brothers dogs something to long for. will i be able to track my shipment? no. it would cost more and it's not really worth it. if your dog is getting anxious and wants to know when the box is arriving, drop us an email and we'll let you know. what is your shipping policy? do you offer free shipping? shipping is free for every box, every time. that's awesome, right? when will my dogs barkbox ship? barkboxes are sent every month, like clockwork. we'll send out boxes on the 15th of each month (in plenty of time for a christmas gift...hint hint), and we'll bill you for the next box 30 days after you've signed up. what if i want to change my address? head on over to the account page to change your address and any other information that needs updating. if you can't seem to get that to work, feel free to email us with your name and new address where you'd like your barkbox shipped. please send us that email from the email address you registered with so we can ensure your friend's dog from down the street isn't trying to pull a fast one on us. why do you keep capitalizing both b's in the word barkbox? we really like the letter b. gifting can i gift a barkbox subscription? of course! you can gift 3, 6 or 12 months of barkbox to anyone you’d like! all we need is your payment information and their email address to get started. once we have all those details, we’ll shoot your recipient an email letting them know what a great friend you are and prompt them to sign up using their unique gift code. if i have a gift subscription, what happens when i reach my last month? at the start of the last month of your gift subscription, we’ll shoot you an email to let you know where and how to sign up to continue receiving a barkbox. be aware, if you decide not to continue receiving barkbox, your dog may be very upset with you. what if i don't know my recipient's shipping address? if you are gifting a barkbox to a friend (they’re gonna love it!) we’ll send an email with a gift code letting them know about your thoughtful present. your recipient will then be able to login and create an account using their own information using the gift code that was sent to them. other info do you have a privacy policy? yes we do. you can find it here. i want to talk to a person there, can i call you? no. email is better. we never check our voicemails but will usually respond to an email within a few hours. how do i return a defective product? send it back to us and we can send you a new item, or we can just credit you. your choice. will you tell me what is coming in my box ahead of time? can my dog choose? no, we won't tell you, we like surprises. but we definitely want to know when your dog has ideas for future boxes. transcribe requests from your dog and we'll consider their ideas for the future. i love this bone/treat/toy/etc? where do i buy it? after you hand out the goodies to your dog, look deeper in the box. we included a write-up on all of the products including the website address of each product, and in many cases, promotional codes for discounts on the products. are there any hidden fees? nope, it's only your monthly subscription fee. no shipping, no handling, no taxes, no special charges of any kind. what's your cancellation policy? you can cancel your subscription via the account page at any time. this means you will still be charged for and shipped the barkbox for that month, but your subscription will not be renewed for the next month. if you'd like to cancel your subscription immediately and be refunded for the current month, shoot us a line at support@barkbox.com so that we can take care of you. either way, we bet your pup would be happier if you didn't cancel! i forgot to use my promo code! no problem, just send an email to and we will be sure to credit your account. what if my promo code doesn't work?
