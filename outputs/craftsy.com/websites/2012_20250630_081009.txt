many of the most popular ipad apps play sound even when your ipad is on mute... so, a lot of us have our ipads on mute and understandably have no idea that we do because we are able to listen to videos on youtube or music on pandora. check the switch above the volume buttons on the right side of your ipad. depending on how your ipad is set up, when this switch is turned on (you will see orange), your ipad may be on mute. if you see this orange dot, please slide the button up so you no longer see orange. if that doesn't help - your side button may be set to lock the rotation of your screen. in this case, click once on the home button to get to your home screen. then, double-click on the same home button - this will open a bar at the bottom of your screen with your open apps. if you swipe this bar all the way to the right, you will see you sound settings. in the left corner, you will see a speaker with a line through it. please click on it once and this will turn mute off and you should be able to watch and hear your classes. i'm only seeing the videos in portrait orientation on my ipad. how can i view them horizontally? if you aren't able to switch your class from a vertical view to a horizontal one, check the switch above the volume buttons on the right side of your ipad. depending on how your ipad is set up, this button when turned on (you will see orange) may lock the orientation and prevent you from moving it into landscape mode. if you see this orange dot, please slide the button up so you no longer see the orange circle. if that doesn't help, your button may be set to mute your volume. in this case, click on the home button once to get to your home page. then double click on the same home button, this will open a bar at the bottom with your open apps. if you swipe this bar to the right you will see the orientation settings. in the left corner you should see a icon with an arrowed circle. if there is a lock icon in the center, please click on it once to remove the lock. this will allow you to change your ipad's orientation. craftsy courses what is a craftsy online course?
