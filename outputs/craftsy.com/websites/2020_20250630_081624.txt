yes. we understand the value of this benefit, and this access for instructors will remain active. you should have received a communication regarding how to re-establish your complimentary account. if you have any trouble in connecting to your account, or accessing the library of content on craftsy.com, just let us know and we can help. what’s your process/plan for producing new content? while we’re in this very intensive process of introducing the new craftsy site and focusing on making the community a positive experience for all users and instructors, new class development will take a back seat for a bit. in addition, the restrictions on travel and group activities due to covid-19 will also inhibit our plans to create new in-studio content in the immediate future. as we get through these transitional issues, we will communicate future development plans. if i have an idea for a new class, who can i pitch my ideas to? if you have ideas for new classes, you can send those to the instructor relations team. please email us at instructors@tnmarketing.com. where will the filming and production of new classes take place? tn marketing is in a suburb of minneapolis. we have a state-of-the-art video production facility within our home office, with the latest in video and audio technology. we’ve created hundreds of hours of instructional video content in our studio over the years, and we’ll likely use our own studio for any new craftsy productions. in some isolated cases, we have produced content in locations outside our studio, either for proximity to an instructor or some unusual production needs. will i still get paid on the same schedule as i did with bluprint? yes, the payment process, including the timing of the quarterly payments, will remain as they have been. you’ll be paid within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter-end, provided your classes are active. will there be an instructor dashboard like before? in the early stage of the new craftsy.com, there will not be an instructor dashboard available on the site. however, we will indeed create, or use, a tool that will give you good transparency to what is happening on the site with the classes you taught. please bear with us as we develop the reporting tools you’ll see going forward, for class sales, viewership, and royalty reporting. i live outside the u.s.a. and would like to be paid via direct deposit or wire transfer, is that possible? we can accommodate payments to any country, as long as you provide us with sufficient banking or account information that we request. while we’ll keep our options open for the best way to execute those payments, rest assured you’ll be paid via some electronic method, with no material delay in the timing of such payments. if a class i taught was retired by the prior bluprint/craftsy, how is it handled on the new craftsy? if you have a class that was retired, that class will still be available to view for any customer who purchased that class in the past on an ala carte basis (purchase to own). however, no retired class will be available to purchase going forward on a single-class basis, nor will it be available to view as part of the premium membership program. if i want to remove content from the site, can i do so? with agreements in place for any content that was created by bluprint/craftsy and an instructor, there is no provision for instructors to simply remove classes or opt-out of the new craftsy site. if there is a special situation that you think makes it imperative to remove from the site, please let us know and we can talk about your situation. some of my class content was shot several years ago; is there a way to update or refresh it? we can’t commit to new editing or rework on existing classes. depending on what aspect of your class you want refreshed, and the resources involved to make those updates, we would look at each situation separately. if you think something is either clearly wrong or provides some unsafe procedure for users, please do let us know right away. will you be selling products and kits? as tn marketing did not acquire any of the physical patterns or kits in the purchase from bluprint, there will not be any kit-based offers we can offer. as we move ahead with the site, we will likely create/offer a small number of kits and product bundles that can be sold with classes. but we do not intend to build out an extensive product line of physical goods, fabrics, or kits to sell in our shop. that is not a business we know, nor want to develop. that said, we are exploring the possibility of creating meaningful alliances with retail/e-commerce partners that will allow us to connect the craftsy community with good products and special offers as a benefit of belonging to craftsy. what efforts will be made to market or promote the craftsy classes i taught? we will deploy a diverse range of marketing strategies to sell the craftsy class content. we’ll be selling classes as both single-class transactions (purchase-to-own tvod) and as part of the premium membership program offers (subscription svod). we’ll be exerting significant energy and resources in selling content in both ways, as consumers have different preferences for accessing and owning their classes. will international users have the ability to buy classes? yes, no matter where a user may live, they will be able to purchase either individual classes, or join as a premium member, on craftsy.com. if i want to remove my name from your mailing list, how do i do that? just let us know and we can do that. as part of the site, and with a link on any email we send, you and consumers will have complete control over your communication preferences. your options include removing yourself from selected types of emails, or from all emails. sign up for our newsletter. stay connected to craftsy experts. email* making lives better through creativity facebook instagram pinterest youtube twitter popular categories quilt knit sew crochet embroider cake decorating bake cook popular categories draw paint photography writing paper crafts jewelry making gardening woodworking popular projects coffee-shop cakes quick quilted gifts fair isle fundamentals sewing wallets crochet in the round asian dumplings thank-you cards live streaming events all free classes customer service about us contact us frequently asked questions craftsy membership info instructor resource center corporate subscriptions © 2021 craftsy terms of service privacy policy do not sell my info username or email * password * remember me lost your password?
