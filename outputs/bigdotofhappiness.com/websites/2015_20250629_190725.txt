i have ordered many times and each time you exceed my expectations. it's great that personalized items ship fast, and shipping costs are reasonable. please don't ever change! i'm a happy customer and will order in the future. i ordered cute water bottle labels form your company a month or so back.  i personalized them for my sister in laws first baby shower for november 4th.  unfortunately we had to cancel the baby shower because there were some problems with the pregnancy and they had to deliver the baby two months early.  i called and talked to someone from your company about reordering my water bottle labels to say "amber's baby celebration."  the lady who i was talking to came back on the phone and informed me that your company would reprint and ship my whole order free of charge.  it brought tears to my eyes that you guys did that for us.  it touched my heart that in hard times in this world, that a company is willing to do something so nice. you guys went above and beyond great customer service!  i have been telling everyone i know, and advertising the heck out of your company.  you will always have my business!!  thanks again for kindness. i am very confident i will be ordering again from you in the future. not only is your product top of the line, but the folks in your call center were absolutely great to talk to. every single one of them. send some of those lovely manners and attitude over here to the east coast. as the irish would say, you have a "brilliant' staff... cutest ideas i've seen....shown by men...now that’s awesome!! the customer service was amazing. i got an immediate confirmation from a real person, not a computer generated one and it was on a sunday! these were shipped the next day!! words cannot describe how impressed and happy i am. love this website. they have such cute options and i love the selection. it should be called the big box of happiness!! i am always so happy to see it arrive on my door step! i wish i could give them 10 stars for customer service!  what a great company.  i ordered some personalized candy wrappers and i had not heard of this company before.  there is always a little piece of me that is nervous giving my credit card to a company i don't know.  well, not only were they secure, they actually had a real person call just to confirm they had received my order and all was well.  they were polite and cheerful, felt like a neighborhood store!  items arrived as promised, on time and were very good quality.  i am going to tell everyone about this company and will use them again. love this company and its approach to life! happiness. the box made me smile over and over. thank you. bdoh is a great primary resource for all of your event planning needs. they think if everything...literally. anything from the obvious items such as plates, napkins, cups, to the more intricate details, of personalized banners, initiations and balloons, goodie bags and so much more! they also help you remember everything to host a great party, by linking products that pair well with the items in your shopping cart. thank you to bdoh, my sister's baby shower was a hit and certainly the talk amongst friends and family. phantasmagorical (yes, it is a real word!) fabulous awesome i would use all those words. shower is next week, and i cannot wait for everyone to see the decorations. awesome staff!

timely, creative, different, accommodating, when i had to call with a question, not only was service provided wonderfully but it was so fun! i like that it’s a business but its quirky and refreshing. also quality is a plus. every item was exactly as pictured/described and of good quality. i have been raving about you guys since the shower - you were so great - i cannot believe how great your customer service is and everything was exactly as shown, came quicker than i expected it to and you follow through on everything - i only wish more businesses were like you! thank you, thank you, thank you - you are the absolute best!!!! a one-stop shop for all of your party needs. a place that truly cares about the people ordering (make them into a hostess hero), the event taking place (with high quality and unique products), and they give amazing customer service in all aspects of their business. i recently dealt with your web site and it's customer service for the very 1st time and want to say how impressed i am.  your choice of products is awesome, turnaround time amazing, and your customer service is excellent (handled by ali).  i will surely be sharing my views with friends and family for future party purchases.  gone are the days of the limited supply of paper goods locally. i absolutely love you guys and will use you for all my party ideas and i have told my sister in law who is a party planner that if she uses any other company she is a frickin’ idiot because you guys are awesome! i am so impressed from start to finish! aside from the fact that the site and ordering process are easy to navigate, what really made a difference is the tlc that went into the packaging: everything was packed so neat and diligently, was beautifully wrapped and looked rather like a present than just some ordered goods dumped into a box. wow! shipping times were fast and shipping cost reasonable. around the time of my baby shower i even received a handwritten thank you card with best wishes for my event! very thoughtful and sweet :) ... on a general note: love those fun little "how to" videos ;) you guys are awesome! this is the third time i have shopped for baby and bridal shower products. i love the free personalization and that you can get everything to match! the shipping is really fast!! the site is user friendly as well! thanks for making it easy to make a baby or bridal shower look great! i was very pleased by the items we ordered.  they were adorable and made everything at the shower very nice.  i was more amazed by the customer service, never experienced anything like it.  so helpful and knowledgeable.  i haven’t experienced many companies with this high level of service!
