in the past we have created adorable invitations for customers not only with our invitations- but with our favors too! we had a customer email and say she wanted to use our standard size candy bar wrapper as an invitation for her daughter's birthday party that she could hand out at school. we simply removed the nutrition facts completely and replaced with her text. placing this concierge order is a small design fee- this order for example was a $5.00 charge to change all of the wrappers. if you wish to place an order with us to change colors or nutrition information, simply give us a call and we can place the order for you by phone- we would love to help! the picture below is how it turned out. absolutely adorable! this post was posted in baby showers, baptisms, birthday parties, bridal shower, customer moments {perfect party} rustic floral party trends posted on january 13, 2014 by lindsey mattson simply elegant, rustic floral party theme is just right for any romantic. the mason jar, flowers and lace will look right at home at baby showers, birthday parties or bridal showers. hostess hero tip: mix and match the same pattern in different colors to create interest and dimension at your party tables. the chevron pattern is perfect for creating a you-nique party. once you have chosen the rustic floral party theme for your celebration, you can customize your event to perfectly suit the guest of honor. this baby shower used chevron yellow dinner plates under chevron pink dessert plates,then added a chevron yellow cup and chevron pink napkin to incorporate both theme colors. the addition of a mini glass mason jar filled with pink sixlet candies and topped off with a custom rustic floral sticker made each place setting a special spot for the baby shower guests. will you be planning a baby shower this year? tell us what theme you are using below in the comments!
