display model scratch & dent used all clearance about us back in 2005, we began as a father-son team selling used appliances from our one-car garage. ben and bill hallman attended the salvation army auction every morning, and purchased used machines that had been donated. we'd bring them home, test in our driveway, repair, and sell on craigslist to folks in the austin area. soon business was becoming too much for 2-guys to handle, and ben was able to convince his girlfriend teresa to quit her job and join the young company. one year later, we were awarded a contract with lowe's to develop a new program to clear their used haul-away machines from a dozen stores in central texas. this allowed us the ability to expand our operations into a large warehouse facility, and begin assembling a team. we chose to base operations in south austin off congress avenue. the economy was booming, and we expanded rapidly. ben's brothers john and robert joined shortly thereafter, as well as several other key personnel. in the spring of 2007, the company began aligning itself with major appliance manufacturers. over the next year, we became full-line dealers for more than 100 brands. we sold our lowe's contract to a competitor, and focused 100% on acquiring discounted new merchandise, as well as special ordering the items we did not have in stock. we continued to grow. late 2008, the weakening economy began to show major signs of trouble ahead. we quickly downsized our warehouse space, liquidated merchandise, and devised a plan to launch a major website that we could showcase thousands of items on. during the development of our new website, ben began searching for even more products, and found himself overseas. he began visiting factories to build products for us, and we became a direct import distributor of appliances under our new hallman label (hallman industries). in 2010, we began searching for a new facility outside austin that would enable the company to store products at a lower cost, resulting in lower prices for our customers. it took four years of patience, but eventually the b-bar-b ranch in bastrop county became available, with a modern 40,000 sqft building on-site. it had previously been a car museum owned by the legendary dick burdick, who was in the process of liquidating many of his assets. after six months of negotiating, the deal was finalized may 16th 2014, and the family moved out to the property. our lease in south austin ended three months later, and all of the inventory was moved to the new building. today we live and work from our property, and have 3 trucks sending machines around central texas daily. in addition, we now ship items to many customers all over the united states. over the past 9 years, we have had the opportunity to serve more than 15,000 customers. countless friendships and memories have been made along the way. our customers are the life-blood of our company, with referral word-of-mouth sales accounting for more than half our business. moving forward, we have exciting plans to continue improving our products, services, and overall customer experience. most of our in-stock merchandise is available to browse right from the clearance center on the website, and all special orders arrive fairly quickly. fortunately texas is a good place to be, and our business continues to evolve. on a personal note, ben and teresa now have three young boys of their own that come to the warehouse almost daily to let dad know it's time to come home for dinner. papa bill recently retired to a life of relaxation, but lives in the carriage house on the ranch, so he's always nearby when we need some valuable insight, and to bounce ideas off of him. please come see us or give us a call if you need anything. hopefully our years of experience and inventory accumulation can help to provide you with a fantastic deal. if you're reading this as past customer or supplier, thank you for contributing to our story. we appreciate it very much. who we serve aus-tex appliance serves a wide range of customers. our core business has always been the "everyday consumer" shopping for their own personal use. however, we routinely work with builders, contractors, architects, "flippers", government agencies, educational institutions, property managers, and more. we even sell items to other appliance stores regularly. the majority of our sales are to folks in texas, but we also ship items to customers around the nation daily. please let us know if you need anything, and we'll be glad to help. sign up for
