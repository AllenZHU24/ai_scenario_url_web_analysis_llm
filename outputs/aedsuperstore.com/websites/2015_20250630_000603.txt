if you are a non-profit serving children in midwest and western states, you may qualify for assistance through the union pacific foundation, www.up.com/found. the wal-mart foundation has a community & giving program that provides assistance to improve the lives of individuals in their communities. information can be garnered at: http://walmartstores.com/communitygiving/203.aspx also, the target foundation sponsors grants for k-12 schools and other non-profit organizations. for public service organizations: first responder grants is sponsored by the nra and applies to law enforcement agencies seeking defibrillators for their vehicles, among other items. this grant is expected to become active in june 2012. beware of false grant schemes unfortunately, some aed dealers may advertise a brand-name aed, then ask customers to complete an extensive "grant" application to become eliglible to save hundreds of dollars. as a result, customers may release confidential information, waste valuable time filling out unnecessary forms, and end up paying more for an aed than if it were purchased outright from a reputable dealer. we strongly recommend avoiding grant schemes offered directly by aed dealers. reputable companies like the aed superstore have prices below so-called grant specials, and with no extensive forms to complete. contact the aed superstore for assistance we hope the information above helps you should you require funding for your aed purchase. once you receive funding, please remember to look to the aed superstore. here you will find friendly assistance and enjoy the best selection and prices for all major brands of aeds and accessories. categories - aeds - aed accessories - aed training units - aed wall cabinets - aha upgrades - cpr kits, masks, bvms - first aid kits - first aid o2 & pulse ox - medical direction - signs, decals, posters - training classes - training manikins - als defibrillators aed outlet aed blog aed leasing aed trade-in program battery recycling credit application grant information order form privacy policy security policy home package specials buying guide contact about my account aed superstore, an allied 100, llc company 1800 us hwy 51 n | woodruff, wi 54568-9558 | phone: 715-358-2329 | fax: 888-364-2377 | call toll free: 800-544-0048 ©2002- aed superstore. all rights reserved. annuvia bio detek first aid only heartstation life corporation microtek respironics safetec smiths medical solaris medical technology spo medical compact size (smaller aeds) standard size (all aeds) stainless steel hand crafted wood tall with oxygen shelf outdoor manufacturer/specialty zoll aed fire rated check tags decals pins wall posters wall signs cardiac science defibtech heartsine laerdal medical philips healthcare physio-control prestan products zoll medical ambu cpr prompt laerdal medical life/form nasco prestan products ruth lee simulaids wnl safety products aed/cpr training classes aha ecc course materials aed & cpr rescue kits bag valve masks compact suction units cpr barrier keychains cpr masks & shields cpr rescue aids emergency oxygen first aid kits pulse oximeters philips healthcare heartstart mrx (ems) heartstart mrx (hospital) heartstart xl heartstart xl+ physio-control lifepak 15 lifepak 20e zoll medical e series m series m series cct r series philips healthcare heartstart mrx (ems) heartstart mrx (hospital) heartstart xl heartstart xl+ physio-control lifepak 12 lifepak 15 lifepak 20/20e zoll medical e series m series m series cct r series 900/1200/1400/2000 series
