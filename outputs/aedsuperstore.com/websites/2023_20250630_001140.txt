superstore resource center our comprehensive aed resource center provides you with all the information you need for automated external defibrillators (aeds), sudden cardiac arrest (sca), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), and other heart health topics. whether you're buying your first aed for home or business or you're a seasoned healthcare professional, you'll find the latest and most important news and information about aeds right here. getting started existing owners research aed superstore grant scholarships visit our blog aed laws by state laws governing the use of aeds vary by state with regards to training, registration, aed placement, and physician oversight requirements. all 50 states have laws protecting people who use aeds in good faith. knowing your state's laws we recommend everyone who has an aed in a public location be familiar with the legal requirements and their obligations according to their state. an aed is an amazing, life-saving tool that must be properly maintained so it can do its job if needed, and many states have legislation to help ensure owners follow through on their responsibility. good samaritan laws laws limiting civil liability for a well-intentioned but untrained user, commonly known as a good samaritan, are critically important in encouraging people to respond if an aed is present. someone suffering from sudden cardiac arrest is already technically dead. every second that passes is critical, and waiting for ems to arrive may mean death or brain damage for the victim. these laws range from limiting the liability of the user, to the user and the owner of the aed, or to other situations. locations where aeds are required some states mandate that aeds be located in specific locations or public areas. the following examples illustrate how widely laws vary in terms of state requirements for types of facilities that must have an aed. a non-comprehensive list of states and required locations includes: any facility with a capacity of over 300 people: rhode island certain types of new construction, in accordance with sb 287: california coal mine operators: pennsylvania, west virginia dental offices, if anesthesia is administered: colorado, florida, idaho, illinois, kentucky, new york, virginia, washington dialysis centers: alabama, new hampshire golf courses: connecticut health clubs: california, illinois,
