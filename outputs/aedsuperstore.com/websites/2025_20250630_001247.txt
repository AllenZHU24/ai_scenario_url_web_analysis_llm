one exception is the zoll aed plus which uses ten consumer lithium 123a batteries. all ten batteries should be replaced at the same time. in the case of the physio-control lifepak cr® plus and physio-control lifepak express® aeds, the devices use an internal battery which is trickle-charged using a charge-pak charging unit which is sold together with new electrode pads. have additional questions? visit our aed battery and electrode pads faq page to learn more. at aed superstore we take sudden cardiac arrest extremely seriously and understand that well-maintained equipment and the right information can be the difference between a successful emergency rescue and a life lost. keep your equipment ready and be sure to let us know how we can help. at aed superstore we take sudden cardiac arrest extremely seriously and understand that well-maintained equipment and the right information can be the difference between a successful emergency rescue and a life lost. keep your equipment ready and be sure to let us know how we can help. sign up bonus of 10% off when you subscribe to our email list aedsuperstore about us careers code of conduct gsa/va supplier order form privacy policy reviews security policy supplier code of conduct terms of use customer service contact us request a quote customer service shipping credit application order tracking return policy terms and conditions accessibility resources aed battery recycling aed blog aed buyer's guide aed laws aed newsletter signup aed pre-owned aed packages aed resource center coupons programs aed trade-in program grant program scholarship program stay in touch 800-544-0048 aedsuperstore 5000 tuttle crossing boulevard, dublin oh 43016 ©2002-2025 aedsuperstore. all rights reserved. items qty price [item_name] [item_quantity] [item_price] subtotal: $0 view cart checkout your cart is empty!
