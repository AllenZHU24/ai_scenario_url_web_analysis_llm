an aed or automated external defibrillator is a portable emergency medical device that analyzes the hearts rhythm for an arrhythmia and provides an electric shock to the heart if needed. the devices are often kept in public places, carried by first responders (police, fire, etc.), and utilized during sudden cardiac arrest emergencies. aeds can be fully automatic or semi automatic and usually cost between $1,500-$2,000, with some models being closer to $4,000.00. how does an aed work? an aed works by analyzing the patients heart rhythm and delivering a shock to the heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) caused by ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. to learn more, watch our video on how to use an aed. who can use an aed? an aed can be used by anyone with minimal cpr and aed training. most aeds are intended for use by the general public and include user-friendly directions such as voice-prompts to help guide lay-persons through their use. do i need an aed? a variety of factors play into whether you, your business, or your organization should have an aed. generally, your need for an aed will come down to three core questions: whats the likelihood of an sca event occuring? what are the consequences if an event occurs that requires an aed and you arent prepared? what do regulations/laws say about your need for an aed? what kind of aed fits my needs? the best aed for you will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to your specific use-case, budget, program management abilities and more. to better understand which aed may work best for you, take a look at our aed buyers guide or give us a call. to learn more about aeds, please visit our aed faq. read our faqsread our faqs about us aed superstore has been providing exceptional service and second-to-none selection and pricing on aeds (also referred to as automated external defibrillators, aed machines, aed defibrillators, etc.) for over 15 years. our passion has been and continues to be making life-saving defibrillators available to all. over the last decade weve improved our complete aed solutions by providing cpr training & aed training, unique aed packages, and improving our aed resources and compliance management. with our acquisition of annuvia in 2013, we expanded our ability to help clients with aed maintenance and monitoring as well. whether youre looking for new aeds, information on sudden cardiac arrest (sca), need training on cpr or emergency medical units like aeds, we have you covered. to learn more about aed superstore, please visit our about us page. samaritan pad 350p/360p8-year warranty! your price: $1,245.00 add to cart defibtech lifeline aedsemi or auto! your price: $1,245.00 add to cart philips heartstart onsitefree carry case! your price: $1,275.00 add to cart lifepak express®value leader! your price: $1,295.00 add to cart powerheart® aed g3newest plus version! your price: $1,445.00 add to cart defibtech view/ecgfull color video! your price: $1,595.00 add to cart samaritan pad 450pcpr rate feedback! your price: $1,595.00 add to cart philips heartstart frxfree carry case! your price: $1,691.00 add to cart powerheart® g5 aedcardiac science's latest aed! your price: $1,695.00 add to cart lifepak cr® plus8 year warranty! your price: $1,695.00 add to cart zoll® aed plus®real cpr help! your price: $1,699.00 add to cart lifepak® 1000free bonus! your price: $2,515.00 add to cart philips heartstart fr3free carry case! your price: $2,520.00 add to cart powerheart® aed g3 profree bonus! your price: $2,549.95 add to cart zoll® aed pro®free bonus! your price: $2,895.00 add to cart + all aeds purchased from aed superstore include: physician's prescription aed check tag aed window/wall decal aed/cpr rescue kit aed machines aed accessories aed wall cabinets/signs training products rescue products als aed value packages training & services our company about us contact us credit application customer service order form privacy policy reviews security policy learn more aed battery recycling aed blog aed buyer's guide aed newsletter signup aed outlet aed package specials aed resource center aed trade-in program our programs grant program leasing program scholarship program why buy from aed superstore?
