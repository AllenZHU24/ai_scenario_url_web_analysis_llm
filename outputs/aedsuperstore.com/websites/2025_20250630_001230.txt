an automated external defibrillator or aed is a medical device used to treat sudden cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. aed units can be used by all first responders including the general public and those providing professional emergency services. they help restore a victim's heart rhythm back to an effective rhythm using an electrical shock delivered through electrode pads. according to this osha publication, aeds used in combination with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), are very effective at improving the odds of surviving a sudden cardiac arrest event. for every minute that passes without defibrillation and cpr, the odds of an individual falling victim to sudden cardiac death increase by 7-10%. you can learn more about purchasing an aed, what an aed is, and how to use an aed by viewing the documents below: how to buy an aed - aed buyer's guide what is aed / what is an aed?
