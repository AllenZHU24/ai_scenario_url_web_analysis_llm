to cart what is an aed machine? an automated external defibrillator is a portable medical device that analyzes a person's heart rhythm during cardiac arrest, adnd, if necessary delivers a shock to help the heart re-establish a correct heart rhythm. all aeds on the market today are intuitive, easy-to-use, and can save a life. how much is an aed machine? the average aed price ranges from $1,200 to around $1,900 with most consumer units falling below $1,600. prices vary depending on the features which are important to you. sudden cardiac arrest & aeds an aed device is used in combination with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) in the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest including the irregular heart rhythms caused by ventricular fibrillation. an aed defibrillator can be found in fully or semi-automatic forms and are usually purchased in combination with various aed supplies such as batteries, pads, cabinets, and signs. a semi-automatic aed requires the push of a button on the aed to deliver a shock, whereas a fully automatic aed does not. both types of aed units are completely capable of treating sudden cardiac arrest. when shopping for portable defibrillators to purchase, you'll want to ensure the models are fda approved and in most cases, come from one of the major aed manufacturers. after your aed arrives, be sure to inspect the packaging for damage, ensure all the necessary components are present and that you are trained in aed use. while automated external defibrillators are designed to be used by anyone, training builds confidence and prepares you for use.
