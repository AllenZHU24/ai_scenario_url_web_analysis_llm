aed battery ages, it's ability to power the aed declines. this can result in a non-functional aed in an emergency. remember, when deciding whether or not to replace your aed battery, an install date is not the same as an expiration date. be sure to pay attention to when your aed battery expires and have it changed before then. jump to: jump to: cardiac science defibtech heartsine philips

crucial part of any successful aed initiative is keeping your defibrillators ready for use in any sca emergency. regular aed maintenance including monitoring and replacing aed pads and batteries is an absolute must in keeping your units ready for action. to aid you in keeping your aeds ready for action, we carry a wide range of aed pads, replacement aed batteries, and other important accessories from all major aed suppliers. how much are replacement aed batteries? replacement aed batteries cost between $35 and $400, depending on the make and model of your aed. what kind of batteries does my aed take? most aeds use custom-manufactured and model-specific lithium batteries. to determine which battery your aed needs, find your aed in the list above! one exception is the zoll aed plus which uses ten consumer lithium 123a batteries. all ten batteries should be replaced at the same time. in the case of the physio-control lifepak cr® plus and physio-control lifepak express® aeds, the devices use an internal battery which is trickle-charged using a charge-pak charging unit which is sold together with new electrode pads. have additional questions? visit our aed battery and electrode
