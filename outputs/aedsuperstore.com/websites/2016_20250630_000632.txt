open a business right here in wisconsin selling aeds! with no experience running an online retail company, but a ton of product knowledge and a heck of a lot of passion for saving lives, they convinced one of the aed manufacturers to take a chance on them. a website was created and jons basement and garage were converted to an office and warehouse. their passion quickly paid off and, within a few more years, the catalog of products expanded further to include cpr and aed training related products. many thousands of aed unit sales later and after finalizing partnerships with all of the remaining aed unit manufacturers, they were struck with brilliant idea number two. you know, were selling aeds on the web where people can easily find us and were offering all of the parts and accessories they could ever ask for, napkin dab and sip of beer, were the aed superstore! their dream was fully realized back in 2013 after acquiring annuvia, a company who provides national cpr & aed training services, in addition to aed medical direction and program management. in plain english - annuvia provides employee cpr training and certification and, through their software arch, helps companies manage their aeds and meet regulatory requirements. jon and ken handed over the reins of day-to-day operations, but still play an important role in onboarding new employees and keeping the culture as true to what it was back in 2002. so whats next for the aed superstore? lets just say jon and ken arent the only two people at the company with lofty dreams. view more meet the team while we might be known as the superstore we are hardly a large army. in fact, at just about 50 employees, we are more like an extended family. amber inside account executive ashley business development beth warehouse candice account manager carol account executive cassie customer care cheryl purchasing agent cindy d. director of sales cindy r. controller danielle customer care david customer care doug business development eileen marketing manager emily business development erin customer care floor supervisor gena lead development representative jan cto jared k. technical jenna business development jennifer accounting jon d. co-founder jon s. graphic designer katie warehouse ken co-founder kevin cfo laura warehouse manager lee it lisa accounting clerk mark it/web developer megan customer care micah ceo mike training center coordinator missy key account specialist & hr assistant morgan customer care nathan customer care patti customer care ray vp of marketing rob warehouse ron customer care rorie business development samantha customer care sara h. customer care coordinator sara o. customer care sales administrator steve warehouse sue senior account manager tiffany customer care tom warehouse wes customer care will warehouse join our team view all available job openings at aed superstore view open positions aeds aed accessories aed wall cabinets/signs training products rescue products als aed value packages training & services sign up for our e-newsletter! > join service center aed outlet aed blog aed leasing aed trade-in program battery recycling credit application grant information order form privacy policy security policy proud supplier to the u.s. government aed superstore awards quick links home package specials buyer's guide contact about us my account aed superstore, an allied 100, llc company 1800 us hwy 51 n woodruff, wi 54568-9558 phone: 715-358-2329 fax: 888-364-2377 call toll free: 800-544-0048 ©2002- aed superstore. all rights reserved.
