or comments. aed superstore®, an allied 100 company1800 us hwy 51 nwoodruff, wi 54568-9558telephone 715-358-2329toll free 800-544-0048fax 888-364-2377 payment and billing we welcome payment through visa, mastercard, american express, discover, check by telephone, paypal® and government purchase orders.  leasing services are also available.invoice terms for pre-qualified customers are net 30 unless otherwise arranged in advance. a 1.5% per month finance charge will be assessed on all late payments. a $20.00 charge will be assessed on checks drawn on accounts with insufficient funds. shipping and handling all shipping charges are based on the weight of the product(s) that are ordered and the destination  "ship to" zip code. we calculate these costs by using united parcel service's (ups) rate calculator. remember, ups ground shipping for aeds and all orders $99 and over are always free within the 48 lower contiguous united states. international customers have several shipping options available when ordering by telephone. customs charges, taxes and fees are the customer's responsibility. how to predetermine your shipping costs: since we calculate based on the product weight and the ship to zip code, we cannot quote shipping charges until we have your delivery information. in order to see the shipping charges you will be charged, simply add whatever items that interest you into your shopping cart and go to checkout. you will then be asked for your delivery address and zip code. after you enter that information and submit, you will see the freight charges. you can cancel your order at any time if the freight charge is not agreeable to you. since all of our products come in various sizes and weights, and since we use ups's rate calculator which bases costs on zip code information, we cannot offer a standard shipping table indicating the freight costs. please note: any orders you place that exceed 150 lbs. in total weight will not have shipping fees noted on your order confirmation. instead, freight charges will be calculated manually by the aed superstore® after your order is placed. the reason for this is that the online calculator from ups cannot differentiate between individual items being purchased and calculates the freight based solely on total pounds incurred. we manually convert shipments of 150 lbs. or more into smaller parcels for ups acceptance. after we contact you with your freight charges and your final total, you are never under any obligation to continue with the order if you feel the charges are unacceptable. that is our promise to you. street addresses are required: we currently ship most orders to u.s. destinations via ups ground service to business and residential addresses. we cannot ship to po boxes because ups will not deliver to them. if you need expedited freight service on an item, contact us at 800-544-0048 for assistance. additional charges will apply. if you have any further questions, please  use our online contact form. warranty service all automated external defibrillators (aeds) sold by the aed superstore® include a minimum of a 5-year manufacturer's warranty. warranty service and technical
