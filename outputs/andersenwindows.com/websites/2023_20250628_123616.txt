inspiration  home style library home style library discover how to create the most popular american architectural home styles with andersen® windows and doors. from detailed illustrations and descriptions to window proportions and hardware finishes, our library will help you bring architectural authenticity to whichever style of home you prefer. american farmhouse first emerging in the midwest in the mid-1800s, the american farmhouse style ranges from small, simple structures to more elaborate homes bordering on victorian. our american farmhouse is a modern interpretation of this classic home style. learn more cape cod although it has english roots, the cape cod style home is distinctly american. it evolved in new england from colonial style houses in the early 1700s, primarily in response to the availability of materials and the area's harsh, stormy climate. learn more craftsman bungalow emerging from the arts & crafts movement of the early 20th century, craftsman bungalow homes feature shallow pitched roofs, exposed rafter tails and a mixture of materials like brick, shingles and siding. learn more french eclectic the french eclectic style is not just one style, but rather a range of styles inspired by french architecture. brought back to america by world war i soldiers returning home, it evolved into a very americanized interpretation of the character and charm of the french countryside. learn more georgian / federal georgian style homes became popular in new england in the late 1700s, as colonists experienced increasing wealth and their homes became bigger and more comfortable. by the late 1700s, the georgian style became more refined and evolved into the federal style, with decorative entranceways and elliptical transoms. learn more industrial modern our most current modern is similar to the early industrial style but its use of varied materials to add texture elevates it to its own category. by using a variety of elements you might find in a factory, such as corrugated metal, concrete and exposed wood, this look has become increasingly popular in urban settings. learn more international modern the french/swiss architect known as le corbusier is closely associated with this home style. his thinking was that function outweighed style. he stripped much of the ornamentation away leaving precise, machine-like forms he called "machines a habiter" which translated into "machines for living". learn more miesian modern pioneered by architect ludwig mies van der rohe (most often referred to as "mies") the miesian home style usually features a steel structure supporting the roof. this strong central framework allows for sweeping floor-to-ceiling windows and doors. this blurring of the lines between inside and out is a hallmark of this home style. learn more mission revival inspired by spanish mission churches built in the early 1600s, mission revival style architecture first appeared in california around 1885. it quickly spread around the american southwest with railroad travelers. it was a splash of boldness with its large arched openings and whitewashed stucco walls. learn more prairie the prairie home style is one of the first architectural styles to originate in the united states. popularized by frank lloyd wright's prairie school designs, prairie homes embrace the belief that a building should appear to grow organically from its site. it uses long horizontal bands of windows and trim to evoke the prairie landscape. learn more queen anne from 1880 to 1910, the queen anne style so completely dominated victorian residential architecture that it has become synonymous with the word "victorian" for many people. queen anne style homes represent an exuberant collection of eclectic details. gables, bay windows, towers and various textures all come together in unexpected ways to create harmony. learn more shingle the shingle home style is distinctly american and traces its beginnings to the late 19th century. it's a reflection of the desire to move away from the more ornate victorian style that had previously become widespread. exteriors were characterized by a more natural, casual style that steered away from classical details. interiors were influenced by the arts & crafts movement. learn more spanish colonial revival spanish colonial revival is an expression of the architecture brought with the spanish when they explored the americas. originally found in florida and california, it quickly spread around the united states. learn more tudor tudor style homes are based loosely on early english building traditions and emerged in the united states around 1890. the most distinctive features include exposed timbers interspersed with stucco. details were often borrowed from renaissance, prairie and craftsman styles. learn more sign up for emails get inspiration delivered! beautiful projects, useful selection tips, and tools for planning your project — get
