corporation 100 4th ave. n. bayport, mn 55003 651-264-5150 media inquiries what our customers are saying i had purchased two 8’ sliders by anderson windows back in 2007 and one of the doors was broken into one week before i was going to europe. lucky for me i was able to get my contractor to replace my door before my trip. unfortunately, i can’t locate the instructions for the person who will be installing them, and elise made it happen. i am so grateful that she was able to help me. i hope she is commended for her great customer service! norma waco, tx i wanted to make sure that your company knows how much i appreciate the help of your representative. through her patience and knowledge, she was able to remedy a parts problem that i've had for years. thanks to her my house full of andersen windows is better than ever. she is a true asset to your company. dane winchester, tn i had a problem with a very old window from andersen and john was very professional, personable, knowledgeable, kind, and patient with me and was able to diagnose the situation and find the part i needed. it is wonderful in this day and age of out sourcing or automating customer service that andersen obviously strives to be world class. i complement your company on recognizing this important area of business focus and i thank you. its service like this that will encourage me to continue to purchase from andersen in the future. bob springfield, pa i found donna at customer service exceedingly helpful and thorough-a pleasant change from other companies that i have dealt with. thank you donna! robert middletown, ny thank you to the rep bryan; he is extraordinary and took time to figure out my problem. he was very helpful and went the extra mile for me. merle chicago, il it is with extreme satisfaction that i write this letter for your service representative, brittney. i called for a replacement lock mechanism for a casement window and a trim piece. brittney was extremely knowledgeable, courteous and patient going step by step with me to ensure that the right parts were ordered. when the parts arrived, they went together perfectly! jerry henderson harbor, ny hello! just wanted to say thanks for such great service. i'm not sure of the name of the csr who assisted me, but she was very efficient and helpful. my part arrived as scheduled, and i was able to install it very easily with the help of the video she provided. please convey my thanks to her. yvette uniondale, ny we have been in contact with your associate elise over the past couple of days regarding some issues with our early 90's vintage windows. she has exhibited a wonderful attitude toward us, treating us with respect and concern, which is generally not expressed by the staff in most "call centers" we encounter. her responses have demonstrated a sense of urgency, a professional thoroughness, elevating her to a level of "ambassadorship". thanks to her and to all of you. bill portland, or thank you very much for your prompt attention replacing my damaged andersen sliding door panel. your customer service is outstanding. steve was most helpful and accommodating. i have been purchasing andersen products for years and will continue to do so. jerry port washington, ny i have been contacting beth regarding a problem with my eagle window sensors giving false alarm signals on and off for a year. she has been exceptionally professional in every way in her contacts with me and has gone far beyond most customer service representatives in her attention to my problem. i would be happy to recommend your windows to anyone, and that is because of beth and her willingness to assist me with this matter. it is not often that a company has an employee who is so willing to stand behind its products as she has, and the service she has extended to me has been far beyond my expectations. shelley ocean ilse beach, nc i have been dealing with your rep, elise for the past few days regarding some replacement sashes. she has been a joy to work with. so helpful and cheerful and taking care of all details. it has been the most pleasant experience. i had gotten so frustrated trying to find an andersen dealer close to us who was willing to help us. elise changed my whole attitude towards andersen. thank you thank you! margret manchester, ca i am sending this email today about my experience obtaining information and eventually window parts after working over the phone with nancy. i would tell you that she was informed, articulate, friendly and very helpful! thanks to her help and the way that she represented the andersen window company i would certainly purchase andersen windows again. i will honestly tell you that i have never had a better experience anywhere. thanks for your help! steve sturgeon bay, wi thank you dante for understanding this issue and thoroughly explaining what happened and to troubleshoot over phone as well as suggesting the links you so kindly sent to me, and just being real professional and your expertise of your product knowledge...thank you andersen for having dante on your team. judy new windsor, ny matthew was extremely patient and helpful in working to solve my dilemma with a replacement part (hardware) for an older custom door.  he was very diligent and worked through the problem. my thanks to matthew and andersen corp. roger lake oswego, or i wanted to pass on to you that i was extremely happy with your service technician mike out of des moines.  he was very professional and over the top helpful in finding the issue with my window.  he clearly explained what was happening with the window and how and when it would be repaired.   i couldn't be happier.  thank you so much! excellent customer service! david papillion, ne i recently got the yale assure lock on my kitchen door and needed to reset it to the factory settings. not my forte! elise took the time to send photos of the procedure step-by-step. we then arranged a time to connect by phone where she talked me through the entire process. it’s rare to get customer service like this! she checked in with me afterward to make sure everything was ok or to see if i had any other questions. what a valuable employee and great asset to your organization. thank you. terry baltimore, md i live in a home that was built in 1959. as i was scraping paint from my window sills i found a label from andersen. it seems i have french windows from your windowalls line. i thought this was cool, especially since they have held up so well after all these years. it is neat to know that my funny little ranch style home was built with such quality windows! susan columbia, tn send feedback please contact us at the numbers listed above for fastest service. if you prefer to send feedback
