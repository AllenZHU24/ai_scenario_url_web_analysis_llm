+ a product is considered defective if it does not meet its performance, manufacturing, or design specifications. an example would be a backpack buckle that comes undone while under a normal load. thisâ  does not include issues such as fit or sizing, or damage caused by neglect or misuse. see below for a list of exclusions. what is the "practical product lifetime" for apparel and soft goods? + black diamond apparel is warranted against defects in materials and construction for the practical lifetime of the product. the lifetime of apparel can be highly variable and depends on several factors. when properly cared for your black diamond apparel can last many years; however, this does not mean it is impervious to damage or wear. keep in mind that black diamond products are designed for use in extreme environments, where rock faces, tree branches, and harsh sun could all damage or contribute to the wear of the product. someone who climbs or skis five days a week should expect that they will wear out their equipment at a significantly higher rate than a less frequent user. please remember that this warranty is for manufacturer defects and does not cover wear-and-tear or accidental damage. using black diamond products in a professional or educational setting can greatly reduce the expected lifespan of the product. black diamond does not give or imply an expected lifetime for any apparel. acceptable wear-and-tear, as well as product life span, will be determined at black diamondâ€™s discretion.â see below for a list of damages not covered by warranty. is my replacement product warranted? + a replacement item does not result in a new warranty period. replacement products are provided to ensure product satisfaction through the remainder of the original warranty period for the original product. will my product be replaced or repaired? + black diamond will first attempt to repair your product. if a repair is not possible, or not cost effective, then replacement will be considered. products that are out of stock or discontinued will be replaced with the closest equivalent. repairs are made in order to restore an item to the original functionality and may not result in a factory appearance. original products that are replaced through warranty will not be returned. do i need to send my product in? + our service center specialists will let you know if your product needs to be sent in. shipping to black diamond will be at your own expense. how long will it take to get my gear back? + service time can vary depending on the solution that is necessary. typical service time is between 3-6 weeks. this time frame depends on the solution needed to resolve the claim. are my cam triggers a warranty claim or should i pay for the re-trigger service? + due to the highly variable usage and wear that a cam can face, cam trigger replacements will only be provided as a warranty service with a proof of purchase from an authorized seller within one (1) calendar year from the date of purchase by the original end user purchaser, as provided in full in the limited warranty statement above. if your cam is over one (1) year old, trigger replacements can be bought as a service or diy kits can be purchased for most cam models.cam repair and service how do i contact warranty about my claim?
