and incredibly breathable midlayers. first light collection versatile, insulating and incredibly breathable midlayers a piece that’s with you through it all, from sweaty ascents followed by breezy traverses to extended belays. you know the feeling. the sun hasn’t yet come up, or maybe it set long ago, and the dew on the branches catches light from your headlamp’s beam as you move silently past. your cheeks are cold, the dark air turning them red, and the tip of your nose tingles. but despite the brisk air, you’re warm, making your own heat as you move up, up, up. black diamond's first light hoody was conceptualized from missions like these, born from early mornings and late evenings questing up granite slabs in the fall and floating through milky powder in the winter. the first light hoody becomes like a cocoon for its wearer, thanks to a breakthrough construction that allows the jacket to breathe in and out. stretch schoeller® face fabric adds durability, breathability, while keeping weight low. nanosphere® technology durably repels water, dirt and oil. migration-resistant primaloft® silver insulation active creates consistent warmth throughout the jacket. next lightweight design minimalist elastic cuff and low profile, single adjust hem keep weight down while adding comfort and adjustability. climbing-helmet-compatible hood adds adjustability and weather protection. weather-ready construction retains 91% of warmth when wet. next easily stowable packs into internal chest pocket with carabiner clip loop for quick storage. breathable nylon woven mesh lining creates a fully breathable package. next first light stretch hoody - men's shop now women's first light stretch hoody shop now close first light stretch hoody - men's images new color close x zoom + 1 / 22
