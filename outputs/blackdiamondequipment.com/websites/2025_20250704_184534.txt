quality and performance standards as our climbing equipment. so whether you need a pair of climbing pants that can keep up with you on the mountain, or something that you can wear for both work and play, we’ve got you covered.mountain adventures call for clothes that provide mobility and durability. many of our women’s pants are built to stretch, allowing for free movement when you’re climbing or hiking. reinforcement in knee and seat areas help to provide abrasion resistance. adjustable hems allow you to get a snug, dialed in fit, and zippered pockets give you a spot to keep small essentials. while our women’s climbing pants are made to last, they’re also super lightweight and easy to pack away when not in use. several are treated with our pfas-free dwr finish, which helps to keep you dry in light weather conditions. our women’s pants are available in a number of different colors and styles. once you’ve found the right pair, be sure to check out our full range of women’s apparel and men’s apparel. heritage it began with a hammer and a anvil athletes from gym to crag and trail to peaks stories notes from the field, the lab, and the community purpose protecting what
