apparel/soft goods (packs and gloves) practical product lifetime footwear 1 year jetforce packs (2019* models and on) 3 years for the pack, 1 year for li-ion battery pieps and fritschi products subject to respective policies:  pieps here fritschi here all other products 1 year *jetforce pro and pieps jetforce bt for the time period specified above following purchase, unless otherwise indicated by law, we will warrant to the original retail buyer only that our products are free from defects in material and workmanship as originally sold. if you receive a defective product, return it to us and we will replace it subject to the following conditions: we do not warrant products which show normal wear and tear or that have been used or maintained improperly, modified or altered, or damaged in any manner. any products or categories not listed are subject to a 1-year limited warranty. if you have an item that requires warranty, a claim can be submitted by clicking the button below. in some cases, we require that the defective product be returned to us as part of the warranty process. in these instances, shipping to black diamond will be at the buyer’s expense (return shipping covered). black diamond reserves the right to determine the cause of damage, and the resolution of each warranty claim, as well as to request proof of purchase for any claim. warranty service faq what is a "defective" product? a product is considered defective if it does not meet its performance, manufacturing, or design specifications. an example would be a backpack buckle that comes undone while under a normal load. this  does not include issues such as fit or sizing, or damage caused by neglect or misuse. see below for a list of exclusions. what is the “practical product lifetime” for apparel and soft goods? the lifetime of apparel can be highly variable and depends on several factors. when properly cared for, your black diamond apparel can last many years; however, this does not mean it is impervious to damage or wear. keep in mind that black diamond products are designed for use in extreme environments, where rock faces, tree branches, and harsh sun could all damage or contribute to the wear of the product. someone who climbs or skis five days a week should expect that they will wear out their equipment at a significantly higher rate than a less frequent user. please remember that this warranty is for manufacturer defects and does not cover wear-and-tear or accidental damage. using black diamond products in a professional or educational setting can greatly reduce the expected lifespan of the product. black diamond does not give or imply an expected lifetime for any apparel or footwear. acceptable wear-and-tear, as well as product life span, will be determined at black diamond’s discretion. see below for a list of damages not covered by warranty. what damages are not covered by warranty? • fading colors, logos and markings, due to use • cuts, burns, abrasions, or tears • packed out insulation • poor fit • items bought used • product that has been modified (such as the use of quiver killers or other binding inserts) • apparel that has been altered, tailored, or otherwise modified by an entity other than black diamond • accidental damage • loss of waterproof coatings or treatments • dulling of points (such as on crampons or ice axes) • neglect or improper care for your product • cosmetic damages that do not affect the product’s functionality • a replacement item does not constitute a new warranty period. replacements are to ensure product satisfaction through the remainder of the original warranty period will my product be replaced or repaired? black diamond will first attempt to repair your product. if a repair is not possible, or not cost effective, then replacement will be considered. products that are out of stock or discontinued will be replaced with the closest equivalent. repairs are made in order to restore an item to the original functionality and may not result in a factory appearance. original products that are replaced through warranty will not be returned. do i need to send my product in? our service center specialists will let you know if your product needs to be sent in. shipping to black diamond will be at your own expense. how long will it take to get my gear back? service time can vary depending on the solution that is necessary. typical service time can be as little as 1 week or up to 6 weeks for some cases. this time frame depends on the solution needed to resolve the case. are my cam triggers a warranty claim or should i pay for the re-trigger service? due to the highly variable usage and wear that a cam can face, cam trigger replacements will only be provided as a warranty service with a proof of purchase within one calendar year. if your cam is over a year old, trigger replacements can be bought as a service or diy kits can be purchased for most cam models. how do i contact warranty about my claim? when you submit a claim, a service center representative will reach out to you and keep you updated on your claim. you can email them additional questions or information about your claim throughout the process. can i get replacement parts if my product is outside of warranty? spare parts can be found for sale on our website. due to practical limitations, black diamond only stocks select components for current products that we think are likely to need replacement within the product’s lifetime. parts for older product will remain available until inventory is depleted. how do i submit claims if i am outside of north america? our network of distributors handles warranty claims in other regions. you can reach out to your local dealer to find out how to proceed; or submit a claim here and it will be forwarded to the distributor in your region. submit warranty claim click the button below to submit a warranty request through our warranty
