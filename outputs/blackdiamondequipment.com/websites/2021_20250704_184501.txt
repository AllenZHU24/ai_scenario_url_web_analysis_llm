trigger replacement kits for most black diamond cams are available for purchase at this link, which will save you time and money:http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en/climbing/spare-parts. please indicate the quantity of each service you need, and then click "add to cart". we will respond via email with a return authorization number (ra) to track your cams. please note that you will need to be issued an ra number before you ship your cams. we can only service black diamond products! any product that is sent to us that is not on your ra is not the responsibility of black diamond and we do not guarantee its return. please expect up to 1 week for a response containing your ra, and a 1-3 week turnaround time on your cam repair request. for international orders, please add an additional 2 weeks. notice if our service technicians deem any cam unsafe to use, it will not be re-slung. you will be refunded for any service purchased for that cam only. by choosing to re-sling or re-trigger a cam, black diamond is not certifying its worthiness for use. we cannot otherwise inspect or test the cams. since only you know the usage history of your cams, you remain responsible for inspecting them and retiring them at the appropriate time based on their history. it is your responsibility to inspect your gear often and retire it when you are uncertain of its condition or ability to properly perform. retire your cams if the cams have been damaged in a fall, if the cam teeth are worn away, if the tailpiece or crossbar is cracked, if the stem cable is frayed, kinked or damaged in any way, or if the springs are weak or damaged. don’t forget to read and understand the instructions that come with your climbing gear. please note: re-trigger and re-sling services are repairs, and will have aesthetic differences from your original cam, including, but not limited to: •	updated webbing styles •	updated trigger wiring style •	different alignment of the bar tacking •	different color thread used in bar tacking your repaired cam will have matching color webbing, but it may have a slightly different look or texture from the original webbing. this is because webbing has a shelf life. black diamond does not stock webbing used on older cams and as we run out of inventory, we will switch to current webbing styles. please expect up to 1 week for a response containing your ra, and a 1-3 week turnaround time on your cam repair request. for international orders, please add an additional 2 weeks. {"products":[{"id":"bd0260230000alls","name":"camalot c3 trigger wire
