fee, but i don’t see that reflected in my order? can you put that on the invoice or refund me the $25? unfortunately, that bank fee is charged by the bank, not by us, and we have to pass that fee onto our customers. we cannot alter the invoice to match what you paid because often we do not receive the full amount and have to adjust our invoice/order to match what we received from the bank. back to top my country places high taxes on imported goods. can you please change the invoice to reflect only $100, or state that it is a gift? our sales orders and invoices are all system generated, and we cannot alter any invoices to reflect different pricing for customs clearance. this is illegal as per the us export guidelines and could result in severe fines imposed on both the shipper and the receiver. back to top i want to order fluke products but i live overseas. we are authorized to sell and ship fluke products only within the united states. we apologize for the inconvenience and will be happy to offer you comparable non-fluke items. back to top i work at a school in another country, can i get educational pricing? unfortunately at this time we can only offer edu pricing to schools

apologize for any miscommunication however, it is possible that the unit reflecting stock was allocated to another order. we send an email once your order is processed with estimated shipping dates.
