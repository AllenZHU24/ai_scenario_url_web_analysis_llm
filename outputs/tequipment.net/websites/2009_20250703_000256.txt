(note: can expand any portion of trace when viewed on pc) measure function: for vertical measurements, on mean or p-p, has 40 millivolt resolution on a 1v/div range. on rms, has 1 mv resolution on the 1v/div setting. frequency is 4 digit readout, and will measure frequency from ~5 hz to ~40 mhz. if a 5 mhz square wave (200 nsec period) is viewed with horizontal set to 100 msec/div (200 usec/sample; see nothing on trace due to display aliasing), meas still correctly indicates the amplitude and frequency of the 5mhz input. this helps avoid or missing high frequency activity when using low sweep speeds. cursor: can have either none, time, or voltage cursors. indicates cursor position and delta of the two cursors. time cursors also indicate equivalent frequency, assuming one cycle of signal is between the two cursors. allows easy measuring of dominant ringing frequency on a pulse edge. stored waveforms: can store trace from channel 1 or 2 to a, b, c, or d memories (only tried a). can recall and display the stored trace, but can not manipulate it, meas it, or expand it. have not found a way to erase stored waves. autoset: seems to work adequately; sets time base to display ~ 4-5 cycles on screen, trigger to ~50% of p-p. acquire & display modes: appears persistence, average, peak detect, work as advertised. owon scope to pc ds wave software: can import traces via usb to scope. (need to turn scope on before connecting usb cable. supplied usb cable is only ~2’ long, changed to 10’ one.) can view images in ds wave, can manipulate/expand, etc. and print. printed info includes various parameters (ch 1 & 2 setting, time base, meas values, etc.) can copy .bmp file as image into word; get only the grid with traces, do not get any parameters listed. can also transfer the .bin data file to excel where typical excel data manipulation and charting can be performed. data file is 5000 points. turn scope on before connecting usb cable to pc. open “ds wave” software. can view scope images, etc. in ds wave without saving to file. to print, view > change background to white first. prints graph, with settings & parameters. to paste graph into word: in ds wave, file > save image > name as xxxxx.bmp (window with files closes) > ok file > save image; rt clk on xxxxxxx.bmp > copy; > cancel open word doc; paste image in (cntl v) get only scope graph, no settings / parameters, etc. to move data file to excel: in ds wave, “get data” > start; (stores file as xxxxx.bin) > close this box view > data table > save as “create name.xls” > ok > exit go to excel; file > open > double click on selected file.
