an item's stock status is indicated on the product page and in the "delivery estimate" column within the shopping cart. why does the product item# appear differently in the catalog than on the website? the item# in our catalogs will also contain the catalog reference number (example: 165911-2751). we omit the catalog reference number on the website since it doesn't apply. note: when searching for an item# on the website, please omit the catalog reference number and the dash. why would the price for an item on the website be different from the price in the print catalog? pricing can differ online from the catalogs due to sales and offers we have for our internet customers. we also have exclusive specials for our email deals subscribers. aside from sales, our internet pricing matches the prices in our most current catalogs. if you have a valid catalog with different pricing, please use our catalog order form and enter in your catalog number, including the four digit suffix. where can i receive answers to questions that i have about a particular product? product information is available on our product pages including detailed product descriptions, features + benefits, key specs, application images, videos and product manuals. still need help? contact our product experts by calling our toll-free sales line at 1-800-221-0516. the sales department is available mon - fri: 7am - 8 pm ct, sat - sun: 8am - 5pm ct. how long will the cart be saved for? does it save pricing as well? if you do not have a password-protected online account with us, you are a guest customer in our system. we save shopping carts for guest customers on their device for 60 days. as a guest, your cart will not carry over from device to device. if you'd like to save your cart for longer than 60 days, or wish to view your cart on a different device, create an account now. if you are a registered customer (meaning you have a password-protected online account), we will save your shopping cart for as long as you have your account, or until you place your next order. while items you select generally will remain in your cart, pricing may change: the items you selected may be re-priced due to our sale schedule. in some cases, an item may become obsolete; if that happens, the items are removed from your cart. checking out questions what are the steps to place an order?
