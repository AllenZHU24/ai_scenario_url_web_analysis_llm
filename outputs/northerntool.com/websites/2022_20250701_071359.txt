likelihood of significant under or over torque. users will experience less rework, less damage, and increased productivity that get them closer to their torque target. the tool&#39;s memory supports up to 4 custom profiles that can be easily accessed with the touch of a button on the tool. once the profiles are saved, connection to the smart phone is no longer necessary. your custom profiles are

being used across your network of jobs and users within 100 miles of your phone. if you&#39;re having trouble locating a lost tool, expand your search with the help of anybody with the one&#45;key app. you will receive an updated location when any phone with the app comes within 100ft. of your tool. you can also employ tool lock&#45;out, or hide your tool from nearby devices, so only you can see your tool&#39;s range. if your tool is lost or stolen, you can render it useless by sending a remote command to the tool to shut itself off the next time it comes within range of any one&#45;key
