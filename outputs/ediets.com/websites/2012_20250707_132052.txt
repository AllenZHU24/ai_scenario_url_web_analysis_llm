analyze trends, to track user movement around the website, and to gather demographic information about how members, subscribers, and/or visitors use our website. in some cases, when you click on a link or an advertisement in an email or newsletter you may receive from us, your browser may be momentarily directed to the site of a third party which, acting on ediets.com's behalf (see section iii,

with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. in contrast to cookies which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. we do not tie the non-personal information gathered by clear gifs to your personal information, and we do not use web beacons to collect any personal information from or about you or to track your activities across websites generally. log files as is true of most websites, we gather certain

link this automatically-collected data to your personal information for the purpose of determining your interests and to offer you goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 4. tracking and merging information from other sources. if you register on our website and provide us with personal information, we may link non-personal, aggregated tracking data with your online personal information through use of cookies, log files and other non-personal information collection. we may also supplement the personal information we collect from you with non-personal or personal information from other, third party sources (e.g., experian information solutions, inc.). we will merge this third party information with personal information you have provided to us. the composite

determine your preferences so that we can tailor our website, products, and services to your needs; to provide you with targeted marketing offers that we think may be of interest to you; and/or to study nutritional, weight loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general. b. information collected by third parties not acting on behalf of ediets.com sponsors, partners or advertisers on the website or in emails, special promotions, or newsletters we send you may also use their own cookies or web beacons when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a page or in an email that you are viewing. we do not control third parties' use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. please review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites. c. children we are committed to protecting the privacy of children. this website is not designed for, nor is it intended to attract,

or transferred to a third party, we may transfer all personal and non-personal information to the party purchasing or merging with us. see section ii(g), other disclosures for more information. a. disclosure to ediets.com affiliates we may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our affiliates. for purposes of this privacy policy, "affiliates" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with ediets.com, whether by ownership or otherwise. any information relating to you that we provide to our

parties whose goods or services may be of interest to you. we will only share your personal information with these third parties if you grant us permission to do so. if you opt-in to such sharing, we may also share your personal information with licensors of certain diet, nutrition, and/or health-related programs offered on or through our website (e.g., atkins nutritionals, inc.). we may provide third parties with non-personal information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. for example, we provide our advertisers and other third parties with aggregate, non-personal information about our website users, including the number of unique users who visit our website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website. c. disclosure to outside contractors we may employ

of special services such as those for contacting members to offer personal, one-on-one, nutritional and member support to help members to reach their goals; and developing applications for our website

services to us. access to your personal information by these outside contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the outside contractors to perform their limited function for us. d. disclosure to third party sellers through our website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information) regarding certain content, products or services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our affiliates (collectively, "third party sellers"). in addition, if you purchase a product or service through one of our co-branded stores (rather than through our online store), you will likely be purchasing the product through a third party seller, not from us. we will attempt to notify you when you are dealing with a third party seller by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our website. for example, if you see a phrase such as "powered by" or "brought to you by" followed by the name of a person or company other than ediets.com, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website hosted or operated by a person or company other than us. third party sellers may request that you submit certain personal information (e.g., name and address for shipment purposes) to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. alternatively, we may offer the products or services of these third party sellers in our online store or elsewhere through our website. if you should make a purchase of these products or services, we will transmit your purchase data and your personal information to the third party seller so that the transaction can be processed. if you do not wish for a third party seller to have access to your personal information, please do not make a purchase in our online store (or elsewhere on our website). by submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the third party seller. this information is used by the third party seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy. we do not otherwise share or disclose your personal information to third party sellers unless you give us permission to do so. e. disclosure to or by co-branded channel partners ediets.com is a contractor and provides co-branded content and services to websites hosted and operated by companies other than ediets.com ("channel partner websites"). you can only access these co-branded content and services through the channel partner website, and usually through the diet or health sections of these other websites. our current channel partners include: aol and msn, among others. the co-branded ediets.com pages that you may access through a channel partner website have different registration processes and opportunities for information collection, and personal information that you provide on these pages may be shared with the channel partners. each of these co-branded ediets.com websites has its own privacy policy posted on that site, which explains what information is disclosed by and between the hosting parties. if you visit one of these co-branded ediets.com websites, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that website, as well as the individual privacy policy of the channel partner website. f. disclosure to linked sites in addition to the third party websites that you may access as described above, for your convenience there are links to websites operated by companies other than ediets.com ("third party websites") that are not contractors who provide content or services through our website. these links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors. ediets.com does not disclose your personal information to these third party websites without obtaining your consent. in addition, ediets.com does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites. if you choose to link to one of these third party websites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that third party website collects and uses your

the assets of ediets.com. we will endeavor, in good faith, to gain the third party's agreement and adherence to the terms of this privacy policy. in addition, we will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our website and through email. section iii how ediets.com handles security the security of your personal information is important to us. when you enter sensitive information (such as

generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. no method of transmission over the internet, or method of

have any questions about security on our website, please email us at help@ediets.com section iv your privacy choices except as otherwise described in this privacy policy, we will only use personal information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. you may also change your preference and "opt-out" of receiving voluntary,

such update, correction, change, or deletion. you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to ediets.com from our

impossible for us to locate. nevertheless, we promise that upon receiving your request, all personal information stored in the databases we actively use for research and daily business activities, and other readily searchable media, will be disabled. section vi contact us with privacy-related questions if you have a complaint or problem, you may email us at help@ediets.com and we will forward your
