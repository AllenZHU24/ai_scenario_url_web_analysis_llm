special procedure that helps us to verify cardholder identity. by placing an order with drjays.com, you agree to a possible charge verification. the small charge verification procedure works like this: we will charge a small sum to your credit card, less than $4.00 usd. this is separate from your actual purchase amount. you will need to check your credit card account to see how much was charged, and then notify us via e-mail at international@drjays.com or 001-858-634-5595. if your response matches the actual amount charged, we will ship your order and refund the small charge back to your account. if you have any questions about our credit card verification procedure, please feel free to contact us at international@drjays.com or 001-858-634-5595. back to top returns before placing your order with us, please be advised that international returns are both expensive and time-consuming. many customers have had success selling unwanted items to friends or on ebay or similar sites instead of paying the return shipping costs to the united states. we will accept returns from customers for up to 30 days from the date that your merchandise is delivered. return items must be sent back new and unworn, with store tags attached. sorry, but we cannot take back personal items such as underwear, swimwear, make-up and body jewelry. we will not be able to accept returns on swimwear purchases if the tags or hygienic strips have been removed. when returning footwear, shoes must be placed inside of the manufacturer’s shoebox, then inside of a separate shipping box. do not write on the manufacturer’s shoebox, tape it closed, or use it as a shipping box. footwear returns will not be accepted unless both the shoes and shoebox are undamaged. to send an item back to us, please enclose the drjays.com invoice which arrived with your package. you may use any shipper you like, but we recommend purchasing tracking and insurance, as drjays.com cannot be responsible for lost return shipments. send your package to: drjays.com returns department 17 south middlesex avenue monroe township, nj 08831 once we receive your return package, please allow 1-2 weeks for processing. we will send you an email notification when your refund has been processed. your refund will be issued according to the payment method you selected for the original order. shipping fees are

please refer to the page with your country’s specific information for contacting your local customs office. if you should refuse delivery on your drjays.com order, if you refuse to pay your customs fees, or if your package is deemed undeliverable for any reason, it will be returned to sender. you will be responsible for all fees and costs associated with the return package. back to top subscribe
