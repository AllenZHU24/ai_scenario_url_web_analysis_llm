international credit cards may require a special procedure that helps us to verify cardholder identity. by placing an order with drjays.com, you agree to a possible charge verification. the small charge verification procedure works like this: we will charge a small sum to your credit card, less than $3.00 usd. this is separate from your actual purchase amount. you will need to check your credit card account to see how much was charged, and then notify us via e-mail at international@drjays.com or 001-858-634-5595. if your response matches the actual amount charged, we will ship your order and refund the small charge back to your account. if you have any questions about our credit card verification procedure, please feel free to contact us at international@drjays.com or 001-858-634-5595. returns before placing your order with us, please be advised that international returns are both expensive and time-consuming. many customers have had success selling unwanted items to friends or on ebay or similar sites instead of paying the return shipping costs to the united states. we will accept returns from customers for up to 30 days from the date that your merchandise is delivered. return items must be sent back new and unworn, with store tags attached. sorry, but we cannot take back personal items such as underwear, swimwear, make-up and body jewelry. we will not be able to accept returns on swimwear purchases if the tags or hygienic strips have been removed. when returning footwear, shoes must be placed inside of the manufacturer’s shoebox, then inside of a separate shipping box. do not write on the manufacturer’s shoebox, tape it closed, or use it as a shipping box. footwear returns will not be accepted unless both the shoes and shoebox are undamaged. to send an item back to us, please enclose the drjays.com invoice which arrived with your package. you may use any shipper you like, but we recommend purchasing tracking and insurance, as drjays.com
