flat-rate standard shipping for final destinations in the contiguous united states on an entire order of qualifying products. we also have a few products that have free standard shipping. this rate applies when an entire order is shipped together. separately shipped items may incur an additional shipping fee. this shipping method includes standard outside delivery only. your furniture will arrive on a truck with one driver. it will be taken off the truck and placed within your property, but not carried inside your home or office. you are responsible for bringing the furniture inside. when your order is ready for shipping, the delivery company will contact you directly to set up an arrival time. most of these delivery companies are blanket-wrap shippers. this means that the furniture is primarily wrapped in blankets instead of boxes and other packaging material. this produces less waste while providing better protection for the furniture. if final delivery is outside the contiguous united states, please call for shipping costs. the flat-rate shipping fee does not apply to large b2b sales. a shipping quote will be provided for large b2b orders. white glove inside
