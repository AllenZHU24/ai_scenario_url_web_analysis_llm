can get the process started by ordering your amish furniture with just 30% down. this is an offer that our competitors just can’t match. by making a 30% deposit, you then make another 30% payment in 4 weeks, and the remaining 40% balance is due prior to shipping, with no interest fees or finance charges. orders less than $3,000 or products that ship within four weeks do not qualify for our 30% down payment program. please call us toll free at 866-272-6773 to find out more. the building process once you place your order, either online or over the phone, we’ll tell the woodshop that specializes in your piece to begin building it. each piece is custom crafted to order, with love and your vision in mind. sometimes, it’s a single skilled amish craftsman building your piece all the way from the planks of wood to the hand-tooled result. other times, the workshop will have specialized craftsmen for each portion of a piece—say, one to fashion the spindles on a bed, another to carve designs on the headboard. either way, your piece will remain in that workshop, tended and perfected by the same craftsmen, until it is fully realized and ready to be sent away for finishing. choose your finish once you’ve chosen the perfect piece for your home, we welcome you to experiment with different finishes and wood types to suit your style. there are two ways to go about this: order up to four finish samples right here, even before you order your piece. go to our samples section to select what you would like to see. order your piece, but choose the “send me samples” option provided for your finish selection. you will hear from one of our furniture specialists to discuss which samples you would like to see. in many (but not all) instances, the craftsmen can begin working on your ordered piece while you sort out your perfect finish. no matter who is building your furniture, we commit to having all matching pieces finished together. with our finishmatch guarantee, we take on the extra cost of transferring your furniture to the same finishing shop to ensure that the stain comes from the same batch and the same hands put the finishing touches on your furniture. please remember that due to the natural variations in real wood, stain colors may vary from how they appear on our website, brochures, or wood samples. we bring your vision to your home an exemplary dutchcrafters experience is
