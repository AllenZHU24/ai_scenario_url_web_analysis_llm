environmentally friendly products and doing our part to value the world we live in.  our amish furniture and other products are built to last and not likely to end up in a landfill due to their durable, quality construction!  we strive to offer a wide variety of environmentally friendly and recycled products from polywood patio furniture to heirloom quality amish furniture made in the usa.  our amish furniture is handcrafted from solid hardwoods and we even offer green, environmentally friendly finish options.  we also use locally harvested american grown woods whenever possible to reduce our carbon footprint.  our amish furniture is actually a green environmentally friendly choice because of this decision to use wood from sustainable managed forests right here in the usa.  our furniture is built in the usa which results in a huge savings on fossil fuel as well.  when shipping our furniture we try to use blanked-wrap shippers whenever possible.  this saves on using cardboard boxes and packing materials that is fated for landfills.  when shipping smaller items from our local warehouse we use recycled boxes and packing material when possible. {back to top} copyright notice
