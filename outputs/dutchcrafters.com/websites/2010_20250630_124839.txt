the filing cabinet looks even better than it did on the website and fits in the space exactly as i had pictured it. i was a little apprehensive about the media cabinet, since it was built completely on my specifications â i was worried i hadnât adequately described what i wanted. i should not have been concerned because it is stunning, and exactly what i was looking for. i had a carpenter come in this morning to bolt it to the wall; he was equally impressed with the quality of the workmanship and wanted to know where i had found it, so i happily showed him all 3 pieces i have purchased from you all in the last 1 â½ years! please convey my sincerest thanks and appreciation to both woodworkers. i couldnât be happier with their efforts. the attention to detail and the quality of their work is truly amazing. now the rest of my furniture looks shoddy in comparison. i guess that will just have to be an opportunity to start replacing it, right? ;-) thanks to you also for being so thorough and patient as we worked through the details on the media cabinet. i appreciate your attention to detail and willingness to work with me so that i could have exactly what i wanted. from my perspective, it was well worth it! youâll definitely be the first place i turn next time i need furniture. thanks again, lisa lisa e. va , 2/12/2009 this customer bought: amish furniture office furniture solid wood four drawer lateral file cabinet dear mimi and valerie, just a little note to tell you that our dining room furniture arrived this morning and we're so pleased with everything. it is gorgeous and absolutely perfect for our home. we also want to thank you both for working to expedite the process so that the furniture arrived before i had to leave for russia. these were the last remaining pieced of furniture for our new home and it's very nice to have the opportunity to get everything unpacked and put in its place before i leave. please pass our compliments along to the woodworkers. the quality, style and comfort is everything we'd hoped for. the entire process has been pleasant and we'll definitely be recommending your company to others. with best regards, marie and bob marie h. nv , 2/12/2009 this customer bought: amish furniture solid wood design your own round dining room tableamish furniture solid wood cage back windsor dining room chairamish furniture solid wood cage back windsor dining room chairamish furniture dining room furniture concord sideboardamish chairs: amish furniture solid wood library step stool chair comboamish furniture dining room furniture solid wood old world 2 1/2-door china hutch attached are the pics of the pine wood buffet. its been wonderful!

(i looked at the drawers, for example. not only are they dovetailed, but the rear of the drawer is âstop dovetailedâ so you donât see the pins on the back of the drawer. what a cool quality touch!) as a woodworker myself, though a mere amateur, i am impressed. also be sure to recognize your carrier, gary, for doing such a great job preserving the pieces in transit, and delivering them safely to our home. his communication was excellent, and set-up went fine, as you have come to expect, iâm sure. i will request him next time i see you for furniture. you know, altogether, the biggest problem we had doing business was my e-mail thinking your messages were spam. once i fixed that, the rest has all been easy! that says a lot. it has been great to do business with jmx. good luck, paul b. indiana , 11/27/2007 this customer bought: amish furniture solid wood queen anne dining room tableamish lancaster queen anne dining chairamish furniture queen anne writing desk kate - thanks to you, linse and especially the hardworking guys in the shop for your efforts. cheryl and i are couldn't be happier with the furniture; it is absolutely perfect. just as important was the pleasure dealing with everyone. gary and andy made our day with their timely, professional and cheerful delivery and placement of the furniture. please pass on our thanks all involved and happy thanksgiving to all!

it arrived today (5/1/06). i planted it and installed the lamp on it tonight and holy cow! it was so easy to install and beats the heck out of the familiar metal 't' style posts that are so common. if you didn't know, you would have to touch it to realize it is not wood. i love it!
