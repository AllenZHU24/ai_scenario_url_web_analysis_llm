wonder about the shipment of their purchase. time of delivery and method of shipment depends on the products that you ordered. below is some additional information on our shipping practices. shipping time most of our smaller products ship within 3 to 5 business days of order and usually take around the same number of days for shipping in the continental united states. please expect your order within 6 to 10 business days. because most of the furniture at dutchcrafters.com is handcrafted, it is generally not available to ship immediately. many of our furniture items take between 8-14 weeks before they are ready to ship. they can take one to two weeks to be delivered once they are finished. we understand that you are eager to receive your product. please exercise patience, and we will ship as soon as the product is ready! furniture shipping costs and options at dutchcrafters.com , our first priority is getting the furniture to you in a safe and secure manner that will prevent damage. because of the size of the furniture or distance it needs to be shipped, the cost of shipping can be expensive, but we also do our best to keep the shipping cost down without compromising safety and speed. in fact, we sometimes subsidize the cost of shipping depending upon the size of the order. our other priority is an expedient shipment. we try to balance these priorities as best we can, realizing that each situation is slightly unique. it is important to note that the best shipping method for one piece of furniture may not be the best method for another piece. while a few of the furniture items at dutchcrafters.com can be shipped via ups, most of the pieces are too large and require other solutions. among the other possibilities are a number of options from bulk freight to highly specialized furniture movers. we try to select the option that makes the most sense for that product in terms of protection of the product, cost and expediency. delivery of furniture we believe that you will be more than satisfied with the quality of our furniture. we also believe that effective shipping is critical for the delivery of this furniture. as soon as your furniture is ordered, our shipping coordinator starts tracking the completion of your purchase and planning its delivery. for orders that take longer than a month to finish, our shipping coordinator will contact you close to when it is ready to ship and keep you up to date on its process as needed. most of our furniture is delivered via truck line. if a truck line is delivering your purchase, the shipper will be in touch with you personally to establish a time of delivery. since most deliveries are made by a single driver, y ou will need to make accommodations to assist the driver with unloading. it is also important to note that furniture movers are insured to deliver the product to your home, but not inside your house. it will be your responsibility to move it from the rear of the truck. please note that our shippers use large trucks. on the occasion that the truck is too large to enter your street or neighborhood, you may need to meet the driver to take possession of your furniture. we will do whatever we can to earn your satisfaction when it comes to shipping and receiving your order. we do ask that you keep in mind the issues outlined here, and that moving large furniture around the country is not a simple process. your satisfaction is our goal. if you have questions regarding shipping, do not hesitate to contact us at 866-272-6773. <back to top> cancellations non-furniture orders orders of non-furniture items can be cancelled up until the shipping of the order. once the non-furniture order has shipped, the return policy applies. decorative wooden and fiberglass lighthouses and mailboxes are excluded from this policy because they are specialty made items. cancellation of these orders must be made within 48 hours or before they ship, whichever comes first. furniture orders orders of furniture items can be cancelled within 48 hours of when they are placed. since all of our furniture is made to order and our woodworkers sometimes get to work on them right away, we are not able to cancel the order with them after this time period. forty-eight hours after an order has been placed, all furniture sales are considered final, and our furniture return policy for damaged or defective pieces apply after this time. please inform us of any modifications you may want to make to your order as soon as you are able. these changes may not be possible after 48 hours. those who have placed your order but are still deciding on your stain may take longer to make your choice. the woodworker has been informed to wait on your stain choice to complete the piece.
