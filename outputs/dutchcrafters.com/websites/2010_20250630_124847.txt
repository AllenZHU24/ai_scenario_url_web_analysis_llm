furniture shipping cost - our first priority is getting the furniture to our customers in a safe and secure manner that will prevent damage. because of the size of the furniture or distance it needs to be shipped, the cost of shipping can be expensive, but we also do our best to keep the shipping cost down without compromising safety and speed. in fact, we sometimes subsidize the cost of shipping depending upon the size of the order. our other priority is an expedient shipment. we try to balance these priorities as best we can, realizing that each situation is slightly unique. shipping to a p.o. box- we cannot ship most items to a p.o. box. please call 1-866-272-6773 for additional information. furniture delivery process - we believe that you will be more than satisfied with the quality of our handcrafted amish furniture. we also believe that effective shipping is critical for the delivery of this furniture. we will do whatever we can to earn our customerâs satisfaction when it comes to shipping and receiving amish furniture orders. we do ask that customers keep in mind that moving large furniture around the country is not a simple process. customer satisfaction is our goal. as soon as your furniture is ordered, our shipping coordinator starts tracking the completion of your purchase and planning its delivery. for orders that take longer than a month to finish, our shipping coordinator will contact you close to when it is ready to ship and keep you up to date on its process as needed.  we also try to keep the online tracking system updated as additional information becomes available.  if at any time you could like to check on the status of your amish furniture order, please do not hesitate to contact us at 1-866-272-6773. furniture delivery option - it is important to note that the best shipping method for one piece of furniture may not be the best method for another piece. we try to select the best shipping option that makes the most sense for that product in terms of protection of the product, cost and expediency.  most of our amish furniture is delivered via truck line. if a truck line is delivering your purchase, the shipper will be in touch with you personally to establish a time of delivery. since most deliveries are made by a single driver, the standard furniture delivery is curbside.  we also offer our âwhite glove inside deliveryâ option where the furniture is delivered into the customer's home and set up is provided. ups/fedex shipments - while a few of the amish furniture items can be shipped via ups or fedex, most of the pieces are too large and require other solutions. curbside furniture delivery â our standard furniture delivery is curbside.  after the furniture is thoroughly packed, it is shipped via less-than-truckload (ltl) common carrier.  the shipper will call the receiving customer to schedule a delivery.  most often the ltl common carrier will use a 28' or 48' tractor trailer unit to make delivery. please note that our shippers use large trucks. on the occasion that the truck is too large to enter your street or neighborhood, you may need to meet the driver to take possession of your furniture. the delivery will be made with one driver and the trailer will not have a lift gate. the customer must have someone on hand at delivery to provide assistance to the driver during unloading. additional people may be required depending on the size of the order being delivered. the customer will be responsible for getting the furniture into the home or business.  it is also important to note that furniture movers are insured to deliver the product to your home, but not inside your house. extra charges will apply if the customer requests to have the shipment carried inside the home. this scheduling needs to be done before the furniture is in route to the customerâs home or business.  after unloading and before the driver leaves, the customer should inspect the furniture for damage. product damage is rare, however, if damage is found, the customer should note the damage in the appropriate box on the delivery receipt (provided by the driver) and then sign. contact jmx international and a claim will be filed. (note: if there are any tears, indentations or holes on the exterior of the package, but no damage is found, the customer should still note on the delivery receipt that the packaging contained holes and/or tears.)  curbside delivery method generally is less expensive than the inside delivery with set up method. inside furniture delivery - when furniture is shipped to a customer for inside delivery with set up, a specialty carrier will perform the delivery to the customer's home with two men. the shipper will call the receiving customer to schedule a delivery.  the carrier will deliver the furniture in a 45' or 48' tractor trailer unit. the delivery will be made with two men and the trailer will have a ramp and/or lift gate. the two men will carry the furniture to the room(s) requested and set up the furniture (i.e., assemble beds, place hutch tops on hutch bases, etc.). after unloading and before the drivers leave, the customer should inspect the furniture for damage. product damage is rare, however, if damage is found the customer should note the damage in the appropriate box on the delivery receipt (provided by the driver) and then sign. contact jmx international and a claim will be filed. (note: if there are any tears, indentations or holes on the exterior of the package, but no damage is found, the customer should still note on the delivery receipt that the packaging contained holes and/or tears.)  this delivery method generally is more expensive than the curbside delivery method.   certain items such as cribs are not available with set up service. international shipping now
