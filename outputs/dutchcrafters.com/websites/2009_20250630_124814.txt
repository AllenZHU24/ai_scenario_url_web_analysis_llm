the filing cabinet looks even better than it did on the website and fits in the space exactly as i had pictured it. i was a little apprehensive about the media cabinet, since it was built completely on my specifications â i was worried i hadnât adequately described what i wanted. i should not have been concerned because it is stunning, and exactly what i was looking for. i had a carpenter come in this morning to bolt it to the wall; he was equally impressed with the quality of the workmanship and wanted to know where i had found it, so i happily showed him all 3 pieces i have purchased from you all in the last 1 â½ years! please convey my sincerest thanks and appreciation to both woodworkers. i couldnât be happier with their efforts. the attention to detail and the quality of their work is truly amazing. now the rest of my furniture looks shoddy in comparison. i guess that will just have to be an opportunity to start replacing it, right? ;-) thanks to you also for being so thorough and patient as we worked through the details on the media cabinet. i appreciate your attention to detail and willingness to work with me so that i could have exactly what i wanted. from my perspective, it was well worth it! youâll definitely be the first place i turn next time i need furniture. thanks again, lisa lisa eggers va , 2/12/2009 this customer bought: amish four-drawer lateral file cabinet dear mimi and valerie, just a little note to tell you that our furniture arrived this morning and we're so pleased with everything. it is gorgeous and absolutely perfect for our home. we also want to thank you both for working to expedite the process so that the furniture arrived before i had to leave for russia. these were the last remaining pieced of furniture for our new home and it's very nice to have the opportunity to get everything unpacked and put in its place before i leave. please pass our compliments along to the woodworkers. the quality, style and comfort is everything we'd hoped for. the entire process has been pleasant and we'll definitely be recommending your company to others. with best regards, marie and bob marie helm nv , 2/12/2009 this customer bought: design your own amish round tableamish cage back windsor dining chairamish concord side boardamish old world 2 1/2-door china hutchamish chairs: amish solid wood library step stool chair comboamish cage back windsor dining chair attached are the pics. its been wonderful!

thanks. bob bob co , 12/14/2007 this customer bought: amish furniture solid wood bookcase with doors dear linse, i called and missed you this afternoon, so iâll leave this e-mail. i would still like to talk to you, however. i spoke with katie earlier in the day. we took delivery of our queen anne dining room table and chairs, and matching writing desk yesterday. i took off work for the afternoon to meet gary, so it was all in place when my wife walked in after work, about 5:00 pm. she was thrilled, as i knew she would be. i spent most of the late afternoon looking at it, under it, looking at the detail on the drawers, the table latches, fit, finish, color, and so on. it is a remarkable level of quality, as you promised. and the color and fabric, which you helped us select, are perfect, and they match well with our other things, rug, etc. please pass along our good will to the shops involved. they have done some very fine work, and we could not be happier. the high level of craftsmanship is obvious. (i looked at the drawers, for example. not only are they dovetailed, but the rear of the drawer is âstop dovetailedâ so you donât see the pins on the back of the drawer. what a cool quality touch!) as a woodworker myself, though a mere amateur, i am impressed. also be sure to recognize your carrier, gary, for doing such a great job preserving the pieces in transit, and delivering them safely to our home. his communication was excellent, and set-up went fine, as you have come to expect, iâm sure. i will request him next time i see you for furniture. you know, altogether, the biggest problem we had doing business was my e-mail thinking your messages were spam. once i fixed that, the rest has all been easy! that says a lot. it has been great to do business with jmx. good luck, ---paul paul butler indiana , 11/27/2007 this customer bought: amish furniture queen anne dining room tableamish lancaster queen anne dining chairamish queen anne writing desk kate - thanks to you, linse and especially the hardworking guys in the shop for your efforts. cheryl and i are couldn't be happier with the furniture; it is absolutely perfect. just as important was the pleasure dealing with everyone. gary and andy made our day with their timely, professional and cheerful delivery and placement of the furniture. please pass on our thanks all involved and happy thanksgiving to all!

nicki nicki sinnar co , 8/29/2006 this customer bought: antique reproduction english windsor side chair with splat back i am so thrilled with my furniture! thank you for so much for your attention to detail! the service has been wonderful. i am amazed at the quality. you can't find heirloom furniture like this anymore! damian kyle ca , 8/16/2006 this customer bought: amish portland dining chairamish furniture american mission sideboardamish stowleaf draw extension dining table i would like to thank you and the team at jmx. in september 2005, my family moved to a home. i began looking at furniture that i could purchase for our home. we spent many weekends visiting stores within a 25 radius of home in a small village in hertfordshire. the quality of british and european furniture left me concerned with how long the items would last in a very busy household, who all sit and eat together daily. i came across the jmxco web site while looking for a lighthouse for my sonâs bedroom. as i have always admired amish style durability and ageless designs, i thought that i could approach your company to find out the possibility of having furniture made in america and shipped to me in england. my first contact with linse was very hopeful, who confirmed that this could be done. carolyn spent several months helping me understand what an extension, skirt and apron were. she was so patient with me, when things were not making any sense at all. often times we would email each other up to three times a day. our dining table chairs, lighthouse bookcase and lighthouse clock arrived last week- 20th july 2006. the workmanship and the eye for detail are second to none. i now understand what the extensions are--my extended family can all sit around the table without having to use the patio table at the end of the table to fit everyone around. the lighthouse bookcase did not make it into my sonâs room; it now has pride of place at the top of the stairs. my family would now like to rename our house âthe lighthouse.â we can whole heartily recommend jmx to any of our friends and family. we are now looking at purchasing other items for our home, i am sure that this new found relationship that i have with your company will continue for many or years to come. junice shaw uk , 7/26/2006 this customer bought: amish malibu dining chairamish pennsylvania shaker dining tableminiature lighthouse clocksamish oak indoor lighthouse shelf derek sorry to take so long to email these photos. thank you very much for all your help. we love our new bamboo stairs!

it arrived today (5/1/06). i planted it and installed the lamp on it tonight and holy cow! it was so easy to install and beats the heck out of the familiar metal 't' style posts that are so common. if you didn't know, you would have to touch it to realize it is not wood. i love it! the lamp may need replacing someday, but not that post. thanks! russell guthrie va , 5/1/2006 this customer bought: amish vinyl white traditional lamp post mission dvd rack arrived safely last friday, fast delivery indeed. my wife and i are pleased, the piece is handsome and very good value. thanks for making this a pleasant experience. bill mccullam ny , 4/18/2006 this customer bought: amish furniture american mission dvd rack thank you very much for your wonderful customer service. it makes us feel great about buying from your company!
