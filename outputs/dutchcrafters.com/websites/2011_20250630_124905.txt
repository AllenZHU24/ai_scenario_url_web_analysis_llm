you purchase reflects the amish value of honesty in work and commerce.  a high commitment to quality is a natural extension of the amish faith.  you can be sure that each of our woodcrafters genuinely desires that you are happy with the furniture that you receive. in the rare case that a product has some sort of manufacturer's defect, the woodcrafter who made the furniture will do whatever is reasonable and fair to 'make it right.' please click here to view our return policy. another important characteristic of our furniture is that it is made of solid oak, cherry, walnut, maple or pine, with no imitations or laminates. at a time when mass production and the use of synthetics and veneers has become the standard, dutchcrafters.com still brings you solid wood furniture, inside and out. at a glance solid wood conveys quality, heritage, richness and authenticity. it also offers the durability that lasts a lifetime and can be repaired if damaged because there is no veneer or artificial surface that can be scraped or rubbed through. with proper care, your solid wood furniture will give you service and satisfaction for years to come. we are sure that you will be fully satisfied with the quality of our furniture, not only because we have carefully selected our woodworkers for their skill and attention to detail but also because we regularly receive accolades from our customers for the furniture that they receive. click here to read several of the messages we've received from satisfied customers. <back to top> finishes because we sell products from a variety of small suppliers, the finishes used on our furniture varies from piece to piece. our woodworkers choose stains and finishes that best fit the kind of wood and style of the furniture they make. for our customers, this provides a large selection of appearances that can fit any taste. in common with all of our furniture is the quality of the finishes that are used. whether the piece is stained and varnished or painted and hand waxed, our woodworkers have ensured that they are using high quality products that are the best choice for that specific piece of furniture. for specific information on the finish options for the furniture of your choice, please read the product descriptions. in most cases, a link to images of the finishes will also be available. please note that the finish colors may vary on wood from how they appear on our web site or in brochures. we can also try to match your stain to existing furniture. we recommend that you either send us a sample of the old furniture or provide us with the exact name and number of the stain that was used. please note that we cannot guarantee an exact match of our finish to existing furniture that you may have. in many cases, we can achieve a very close resemblance. however, due to variance in individual pieces of wood, slight differences in duration of the staining process, and other factors, one can usually find a very slight difference in stain colors between new and old pieces. <back to top> solid wood no man-made material can come close to the marvelous, free flowing intricacy of natural hardwood grain. imitations abound, but why settle for less than the real thing?  with dutchcrafters.com , you can be assured that the furniture you purchase is made of the highest quality wood. whether you are interested in our fine oak, cherry, maple, or walnut furniture; our pine furniture; or our blend of antique and 'new rough' pine furniture, you can purchase with the confidence that your items are made from solid wood. there are no veneers, no particleboard, no substitutes.   for the backings and drawer bottoms, we use solid wood plywood. hardwood is a natural fiber. therefore, even furniture that has a good protective finish may swell or shrink slightly from one season to another. please use the proper care needed for the kind of wood and finish of your furniture. with proper care, your solid wood furniture will give you service and satisfaction for years to come. here are a few general tips for the care of wood furniture: regularly dust your wood furniture. carefully choose the best wood care product for your piece. avoid direct sunlight. avoid drastic humidity changes. don't place your wood furniture in front of heat outlets. don't allow liquids to sit on your furniture. <back to top> custom work whenever possible, our amish craftsmen will make accommodations for minor special requests.  this may include such things as leaving an apron off a table, raising the height of a bed or making a coffee table a little shorter. an additional fee may be charged for these revisions. however, major changes to the structure, design or size of the furniture generally requires changes to the pattern.  this can be time consuming and costly.  we therefore generally avoid customization in our furniture.  when we do make exceptions and allow for substantive accommodations, the price for the custom work can increase the cost by as much as 30-65% of the original price. <back to top> © copyrights 2003 - 2011 jmx international corporation all rights reserved. our company about us general information privacy
