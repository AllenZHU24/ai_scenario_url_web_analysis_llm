use the pictures :-) she's still so excited and can't believe this beautiful piece of furniture is hers! thank you again for upgrading us to inside delivery. that was such a huge blessing! there's no way i could've gotten the table and chairs in the house by myself let alone set them up. i'm sending a pic just so you can put faces to the customers :-) this is my mom, her best friend gloria in the middle, and me. her best friend wanted to do something so special for her and asked if i knew what she not only needed but wanted. dining room table and chairs was of course the thing! gloria paid for the table and four chairs. i got the other two chairs and paid for delivery (as a single mom i'm on a tight budget which is why i didn't initially go for inside delivery, i couldn't afford it). i'm in the customer service field too and i know when i've worked with someone over time, i enjoy knowing a little more about the situation and seeing a face :-) if you have a supervisor/team lead/manager, i ask that you forward this email along because you and kari-jo deserve recognition and appreciation for the fantastic job you both did. customer service is not always easy, i know first hand! it's very difficult to maintain a pleasant helpful attitude 8 hours a day 5 days a week because callers are not always nice. after a while, it gets to you and can change your attitude on the phone or in emails. you and kari-jo were extremely pleasant and helpful every single time i called or emailed. neither of you made me feel like i was bothering you or that i was ignorant because i'd never ordered amish furniture before! you both made me feel confident in making this very big and expensive purchase online! you both got back to me quickly each time i reached out to touch base and always came with information. you both seemed to truly care about making this surprise special for my mom and doing whatever it took to make it perfect for her. i can tell when someone cares about doing their job well and when they are just phoning it in. i've worked in a very big call center and had plenty of experience with both. you both care. it seems you've set a high bar of excellence for yourselves and i want you to know that this customer feels you not only met it but exceeded it! i can't say enough how employees like you make all the difference!!!! thank you from my heart for doing a hard job beautifully. lisa w. jeunai from ma on 6/4/2015 hi natalie, our barrister bookcase finally arrived a day and a half ago (tuesday around 10 pm) after such a long wait and it's perfect! it fits beautifully in the spot allocated for it and is exactly what i'd specified as requested - hardware, finish and all. thank you. the end product is very nice. it dispelled both my worry and reservations about the final outcome. there appeared to be a small problem with it not being quite level, however that could be due to the hardwood floor and not the bookcase itself. overall, bill and i are very satisfied. we appreciate the pride and care the wood shop took to remake our item. this definitely reflects the character, integrity and credibility i would hope a company to have. thank you for correcting the situation natalie. it means a lot to us and made all the difference. our faith and trust have been restored. i am looking forward to moving ahead on the other items with more positive footing. i did want to let you know that our bookcase is a success story and to extend to you our personal note of thanks. have a great day and will be talking to you soon! best regards, jeunai george m. from tx on 6/4/2015 just a quick follow-up on the delivery.... wife is pleased as punch w/the new table, and your shipping people couldn't have been any more helpful, polite and friendly! thanks

1st. the delivery man, jake, was fantastic! he was very willing to help me schedule delivery for a day that my mom would be out of the house (it was a surprise for her). he and his helper, ryan, brought things in quickly and made sure to explain everything before leaving. a big thank you to both of you as well for being so helpful during the ordering and finishing processes! i followed up quite a bit and both of you were extremely helpful, kind, and gracious. my mom was thoroughly surprised and terribly thrilled! she said it's the nicest piece of furniture she's ever owned, and she's absolutely in love with it! thank you dutchcrafters for helping us make this a beautiful moment for her! from start to finish, this is the best experience i've had with an online furniture purchase...or any major online purchase for that matter! thank you again!!! lisa w. this customer bought: split pedestal dining table(id: 45220)base price:$1,350.00 ami l. from ny on 6/1/2015 hi

me know what would be the best way to fix them. thank you for all of your help through the process. we are really pleased with the purchase and will definitely recommend you to anyone who asks. please let the furniture makers know they did a fantastic job. thanks again! ami this customer bought: valencia mission dining room chair(id: 43055)base price:$265.20 bellingham leg table(id: 44090)base
