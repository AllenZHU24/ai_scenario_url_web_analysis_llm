about dutchcrafters amish furniture dutchcrafters has been the largest internet retailer of amish-made furniture for more than 16 years. we are the destination for solid wood, american-made, amish furniture that is aligned both with your style and with your values. since 2003, we have sourced our heirloom-quality furniture from the back roads of amish country in ohio, pennsylvania, and indiana. we’ve built solid relationships with woodshops and craftsmen there that we know and trust. we are able to connect you to personalized, custom-made furniture created by skilled woodworkers. our amish furniture and other products are built to be passed down to the next generation. we sell and deliver furniture on our website throughout the contiguous united states, as well as at our amish furniture store in sarasota, fl. our story in 2003, many people had a hard time imagining the words “amish” and “internet” as compatible. yet when dutchcrafters founder (and lifelong mennonite) jim miller was looking for exceptional products to sell on an e-commerce platform that year, he found them within his own amish and mennonite heritage. miller comes from an amish and mennonite family in indiana and michigan. he knew that amish made furniture represented integrity, authenticity and long-lasting value – precisely the alternative to cheap imported products that were flooding the internet at that time. by offering a high level of customer service that matched the quality of the products, miller was able to conceive the dutchcrafters brand – one that reflects his heritage and his values, while consistently pursuing positive innovation in customer experience. miller and his wife linse spent the next few years tirelessly driving the country roads of ohio, indiana and pennsylvania, searching for products and woodshops that could live up to their high expectations, and knock the socks off our customers. today, jim and linse can still be found roaming amish country in search of incredible woodshops, amazing amish craftsmen, and new ways to serve each member of the dutchcrafters family – from first-time customers to lifelong fans. more information about dutchcrafters and the furniture we sell can be found via our content page. our awards we have been fortunate to have our company’s success recognized by several organizations and publications. we were named the retail business of the year by the greater sarasota chamber of commerce in 2017 and a florida company to watch in 2016. in 2018, we were named to the inc. 5000 and gulf coast 500, as we had been in previous years. we have also been included on the furniture today top furniture etailers and internet retailer mid-market 500 lists in the past years. we have been an accredited bbb business since 2006 with an a+ rating. but we are most proud of what our customers say about us. you can read customer reviews on the testimonial page. our values our company’s core values include creativity, authenticity, giving, excellence and sustainability. these values guide our decisions in the products we hand pick to sell and the customer service we provide. we love to be able to offer furniture made of reclaimed, recycled or responsibly sourced materials. we love to give back to the community by supporting organizations, through donations and volunteer time, including mennonite economic development associates,
