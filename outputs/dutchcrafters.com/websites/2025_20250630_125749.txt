driving through the cornfields, on a pennsylvania hill they met an amish crafter of tables, working with his son. linse smelled the sawdust, felt the solid frame, noticed beauty in the soft grains of cherry wood. this is a treasure, she said. this is my heritage, jim replied. they endeavored to share it, and dutchcrafters was born. the table graced their family – a place to gather for nourishment, conversation and laughs. at the table they held hands in gratitude, celebrated birthdays, shared hospitality. and not only their family, but many more across america, where the soil produced the trees that provided the wood that brought forth the gifts. since 2003, jim, linse and all of us at dutchcrafters have sourced heirloom-quality furniture from the back roads of amish country in ohio,
