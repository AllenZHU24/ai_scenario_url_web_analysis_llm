big family party coming up and our multi-leaf table extension had broken. i found an extension on amazon, but they said it wouldn't arrive until a week after the party. in desperation, i decided to call the manufacturer and they connected me to you. you made a number of calls about it and called me back several times to verify that the extension i needed was in stock. then you worked out expediting the shipping to make sure it arrived in time for the party on sunday. i just wanted you to know that it arrived last night. i will get it installed tonight. thank you so very much for going the extra mile to make that happen. it saved my life! (and my marriage!!) we are grateful. could you please forward this email to your supervisor so that they know what an asset you are to the company? i will recommend you to my friends and associates. thanks again, jeff p this customer bought: unfinished maple wood table extension slide(id: 7807)base price:$124 nelly d. from ny on 8/10/2017 everyone gives me a compliment about my table. i love this table but most importantly my picky husband loves it as well. it feels cozy and it's such an inspiration for me. i hate cooking but just spreading my meals and feeling like i'm eating in a diner does it for me. thank you dutchcrafters this customer bought: traditional breakfast nook set with storage and pedestal table(id: 12798)base price:$2,593 tara m. from ma on 8/9/2017 hi savannah, our chairs arrived and they are perfect!

becky c this customer bought: classic mission entryway bench (id: 44167)base price:$880 jill l. from or on 3/31/2017 alyssa, just a note to follow up after the delivery of our coffee table; btw, have already filled out the review questionnaire. the table is beautiful, and just right in our mix of craftsman, greene & greene and japanese living room (sounds really weird, but those styles suit each other beautifully). we are very happy with it: perfect color, lots of lovely ray flake showing, solid beautiful wood with great construction. even the delivery guys were great: they brought it in and unwrapped it for my inspection (i didn’t ask) even though they probably should have stopped at the front door. as i hoped, the table has semi-asian lines – we really love that style. as you requested, attached are a couple of photos of the table in the living room. it’s a 31’ room facing north, so is never very bright, but hope this gives you a feel for the table’s new home. the house itself is from 1922 and fairly formal, so everything is pretty mixed up. thanks again for all your help. i will hope to be able to purchase more dutchcrafters’ pieces in the future. best regards, jill this customer bought: brady large coffee table(id: 49813)base price:$828.20 stephen a. from ma on 3/26/2017 thanks kari -jo, the furniture arrived in perfect condition and is beautiful. i wrote a good review of my experience. thanks to the dc team. regards, stephen a. this customer bought: 48" deluxe flush mission jewelry armoire with pull out doors(id: 49687)base price:$1,494 carey h. from ok on 3/24/2017 thank you, jennifer, for the update. we are blessed to now be moved into our new second home. i had the freedom to choose furniture lines that met my design needs with little regard to budget. my choices included ethan allen, bernhardt, stickley, etc. by far, my favorite furniture is yours. even stickley could learn from dutchcrafters how to make a durable finish that will withstand even the slightest pressures. please share with your crafters how very pleased i am with the quality they are creating. all the best, carey h this customer bought: freemont mission pedestal desk(id: 49579)base price:$2,228 houghton mission bar stool with swivel(id: 53421)base price:$445 richard f. from ca on 3/20/2017 just received the furniture. it's even more beautiful than i expected. love it!!

(we went retro by staying with white.) the delivery guys (jake and noah) were excellent and everything went smoothly. we won't hesitate to order from dutchcrafters in the future, should we need more quality furniture. thanks!
