you helped me last march with this beautiful hope chest. we were working on the wording for the plaque together. thank you so much! my daughter was absolutely thrilled with the hope chest. the below picture doesn't do it justice, but as promised i wanted to forward along a photo as promised. thank you again for all your help!! bridget g this customer bought: maple wood shaker hope chest - quick ship(id: 48287)base price:$595 patrick h. from ks on 11/14/2016 heather i wanted to let you know that our dutchcrafters order (jewelry armoire) was delivered on time this afternoon. i also wanted to say that the driver (emery) was not only pleasant, but also extremely helpful in assisting me to get the armoire off the truck and into our house. i probably could have managed to unload the armoire by myself, with the help of my appliance dolly, but at 73, i really appreciated not having to do that by myself. the armoire is very beautiful and as far as i can determine does not have a dent or scratch on it! i would like to thank everyone involved with the armoire. there is no comparison between a piece of custom furniture and one from a big box furniture store. like the old saying goes, "you get what you pay for." in fact, we often pay as much or more for particle board than solid oak. thanks again for your quality delivery service. patrick this customer bought: 48" deluxe flush mission jewelry armoire with pull out doors(id: 49687)base price:$1,087 alexis e. from fl on 11/14/2016 hi jennifer - sorry for the late reply. the man you sent out was wonderful - friendly and easy to work with. he explained that the furniture wouldn't pull out/back in smoothly without me putting furniture pads on the bottom of the legs, and adjusted the doors in the front of the cabinet so they were level. super customer service and he arrived within the first 15 minutes of the 2 hour window i was quoted. thanks for checking up!

eric and josh (i think his name was josh) were wonderful and i am so happy! thank you so much! ~sarah t. this customer bought: ellington nightstand(id: 50686)base price:$550 ellington panel bed(id: 50687)base price:$846 diana r. from fl on 11/10/2016 hi. kari jo. the desk arrived and mom was there to receive it. she said it is beautiful. i am always so pleased to purchase furniture from the amish. should i send the pictures and review to you for your website? i think it is important to push the american made brands and buying from amish families is something anyone that can do should over any large named furniture stores that over charge and provide veneers vs wood hand made furniture. buy a good product once and it becomes a permanent part of home. most other large brand furniture is good for a few years and then cracks and dulls and needs to replaced. but not my amish furniture that i will have to leave it to my niece in will. thanks you again for such a great job on following up and thru. kind regards. diana r. this customer bought: urban computer desk with optional hutch top(id: 53282)base price:$1,575 tina p. from bahamas on 11/9/2016 hi guys, just received our kitchen island this morning and it's wonderful!!!!

you can pass along to the craftsman the huge improvement with the new legs. though there is still a little sway, it is vastly improved, and takes much more pressure without movement. a totally unforeseen bonus with the new legs is a much greater overall aesthetic balance and pleasing appearance of the table. also, there is tremendous improvement in accessibility and legroom for both chair and bench seating. we are very pleased!

take care, walt this customer bought: fifth avenue office credenza with hutch top(id: 6467)base price:$3,891 thomas s. from fl on 7/18/2016 jennifer- for all the headache i caused you all, i doubt my feedback is of little value. however, i've had amish, expensive name brand and custom made furniture and have never owned anything even close to the quality of this bed. it could easily support my car it is so solid. the 6 drawers in the base fit perfectly and slide like on ice. please accept my apologies. thomas this customer bought: richmond bed with low footboard and storage rails(id: 44868)base price:$1,752 john b. from nc on 7/15/2016 frank, i recently asked regan for your name. i'll try to keep it short but with full meaning. i started my quest for furniture (all wood) via a different company and while they were friendly, things went nowhere quickly and i emailed your company. regan replied and responded to every question quickly. and honestly i did ask a lot of questions. an analogy is this.. when my wife and i eat out, we are fair tippers. average service, 15% or so gratuity. really poor, and well the % drops. really good service and the sky is the limit (within reason of course). if regan were a server his gratuity would be 100%. in this world where complaints are numerous and easy to deliver anonymously, i truly felt compelled to pass along feedback for the excellent service he has provided. very helpful, very friendly, and more importantly very prompt. without question we bought from dutchcrafters because of him and in fact extended our order considerably as a result (the cherry executive desk and credenza came after he had helped with the smaller maple furniture order). i hope this email goes a little way to say thanks to regan for his efforts and affords him some recognition for ajob well done. had dutchcrafters (regan) acted like the other company the sale would have gone elsewhere. as it is, the total sale more than doubled because of him. he has done agreat job!

i hope you know truly how much your kindness has meant to me. i hope your employer knows what an asset you are to their company. chaille this customer bought: wooden airplane rocker(id: 12394)base price:$250 susan b. from fl on 4/28/2016 dear mr. quinones, i would like to sincerely thank jennifer ferdico for her amazing support and representation of your company and merchandise. i ordered two rockers for christmas gifts for my daughter and her family. when i saw them, after they were delivered and my daughter had assembled them, i was greatly disappointed in the quality of craftsmanship. they did not represent the rockers i had chosen when i came to your beautiful showroom on lockwood ridge. i called the store and jennifer was so kind to assist me. she listened to my concerns with a great deal of patience. she took immediate action, asked me to send her pictures and stayed in contact with me through the process of her contacting the vendor and re-ordering the rockers. she went the extra mile by having the replacement chairs personally delivered to my daughter's home and assembling them prior. the new chairs are perfect! jennifer is a tremendous asset to your business. she is a true professional and stellar representative. please accept my gratitude for her kindness and commitment to make a difference. in addition, my apology to jennifer for the tardiness of my letter. it is long overdue. my best wishes to her. best, susan b this customer bought: olde century mission swivel bar stool(id: 46505)base price:$328 leilani w. from wa on 4/27/2016 ashley, ...loving it!

after receiving my buckingham u-shaped desk with hutch in natural hickory in december of 2014, i still could not be more pleased!! as it turns out, there was an error when the desk was made in that it was ordered to fit in the back corner of my home office with the hutch on the right instead of the standard left location, however it arrived in the standard (left-sided hutch placement) configuration. while i was disappointed when it arrived, now i am much happier with the location than i would have been where i originally planned to place it. in this location, i can now look out my office window while still working instead of having to turn around. there is no glare on my computer screens due to the light coming in the window that there would have been for much of the day during the spring and summer. instead of a mistake and disappointment, it has turned out to be a blessing! enough of that… the desk is an excellent piece of workmanship, and i admire it and the beauty of hickory grain on a daily basis! the craftsmanship is superb, and i have no doubt it will continue to serve me for years and years to come! the excellent detail and craft used by the builders shows from the dovetail joints to the way drawers close smoothly and everything is aligned and square (no sagging or misaligned cabinet doors or drawer faces). my job requires that i spend between 10 and 18 hours (often longer, depending on the projects i’m working) at my desk most work days, however i find myself so comfortable at the desk and the way it allows me to arrange my computer screens and peripherals i often spend a good deal of the weekend in here as well. as mentioned on your website, quality does take time, and it does costs a bit more than some of the furniture you can buy elsewhere, but in my mind there is no better way to go! based on the quality craftsmanship of the amish workers who created this beautiful this desk, i am confident that this desk will far outlast my lifetime, and quite possibly many lifetimes beyond mine. more than that, it was made to order so that i have a unique piece of furniture rather than a jigged-up cookie cutter piece identical to many others. rather than the keyboard and pencil drawer, i was able to get two keyboard drawers which makes having multiple computers (necessary for my line of work) much simpler. the craftsmen also modified the cpu cabinet to have shelf that allows me to keep a lot of my network gear out of sight (since i don’t have a desktop/tower computer to store there). yet another modification was an organizer area inside the right hutch cabinet with slots/cubbies for smaller items. honestly, you should highlight the opportunity to get a piece of furniture uniquely designed/modified to meet your needs more than you do. of course that opportunity is available more in certain types of furniture (desks, hutches, kitchen islands, etc) than others, but it was definitely a key selling point for me at any rate, i would be more than happy to be an advocate for dutchcrafters, free of charge :-) if there is some way i could help answer questions from a customer point of view, i’d be happy to do so. i am very, very, very pleased with my desk and think others would do well to purchase from you as well. blessings, scott ***please note - this desk was customized for the customer per his requests. it is hickory wood with ocs-100 natural finish*** this customer bought: buckingham u-shaped desk with optional hutch top(id: 48182)base price:$4,254 charlie r. from sc on 4/22/2016 dear ms. ferdico, we received the buffet yesterday. we are very pleased. it is a good match for our s bent bros dining room. regards, charlie this customer bought: four door buffet - 74"(id: 1063)base price:$1,862 melody k. from wy on 4/18/2016 to whom it may concern, we want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides. our experience has been positive from the discovery of your website, to interacting with your outstanding customer service personnel, to receiving our beautiful furniture today. first, you grabbed our attention with your website. it’s so comprehensive which makes it a real time saver for buyers. it provides the information buyers need to determine if a product is one they want to inquire about further. the site is user friendly and has several very useful tools for buyers. secondly (and most importantly), we would like to commend the customer service provided by ashley (ashley <ashley@jmxbrands.com). what can we say about ashley. wow … outstanding. ashley’s genuine interest in helping us find furniture that met our needs was displayed on so many levels: •	patience in allowing us time to make solid decisions rather than just being focused on making a quick sale. •	listening and searching for products to meet our needs while continually looking at the numerous links for ideas sent by us. •	accommodating special needs for samples and time lines ashley has truly been a refreshing customer service experience. she is a joyful soul and helped make a stressful (for melody) experience … pleasurable. lastly, the delivery of our furniture was made today by the most professional, pleasant, and helpful delivery person either of us has ever encountered. let us close by saying … we don’t have the words to express how happy and satisfied we are with the beauty of the products delivered to our home today. with deep appreciation. melody k chris s this customer bought: holmes mission writing desk(id: 31296)base price:$1,214 economy nightstand(id: 44195)base price:$477 mission file cabinet(id: 50891)base price:$708 benjamin trestle table(id: 53324)base price:$1,844 chesapeake dining chair(id: 53628)base price:$272 chesapeake dining chair(id: 53628)base price:$272 loring m. from ca on 4/15/2016 jennifer- my guests love the new bed. i love the new desk. amazing dual use room transition. loring this customer bought: vertical murphy wall bed and desk(id: 44900)base price:$5,150 susan b. from oh on 4/13/2016 jennifer, i am so impressed, this was really quick turnaround. thanks so very much. sue this customer bought: barn-style mailbox with newspaper slot(id: 2314)base price:$145 mary a. from il on 4/11/2016 i love everything on this order - the junior dining chair, the toy box and the rocking chair. thank you so much!!

we had something of an adventure in getting this desk made; the first was the wrong size, yet i really liked its construction and appearance and decided to keep it. (the too-small desk got “commandeered” by another family member who instantly loved it!) the second time the desk arrived it was correct, however it had a leg broken off in transport. the third time we got it all right! turns out it’s been about a year since i placed the first order. that really wasn’t a problem because i love your finished furniture! i like your furniture so much i’ve pretty much replaced everything in the room. the desk, a file cabinet under the desk, a small chest and a bookcase. all the same wood and finish. it’s spectacular! your furniture is so amazing i just ordered another bookcase to match the rest of the pieces already here. the only problem then is there won’t be any space in the room left to add anything else! :) best regards, danny ***note - the desk in the photo was a sofa table that the customer had customized into the desk. all of his pieces are tiger maple wood with ocs-113 michael's cherry stain*** this customer bought: grand river sofa table(id: 44484)base price:$830 royal mission bedside chest(id: 44872)base price:$1,029 grand river bookcase(id: 45999)base price:$1,160 rustic u dining base(id: 49990)base price:$390 kubik maltbie inc. from nj on 2/18/2016 hello, ally – thank you very much for the update. i appreciate all of the support that you’ve given us throughout the entire process. regards, duane b. this customer bought: windsor dining chair(id: 53645)base price:$332 judy m. from il on 2/15/2016 i very happy with my new armoire. it matches my bedroom furniture almost perfectly including the drawer pulls and the scalloped molding around the base. i am so pleased with the workmanship also . thank you very much!
