q: can you ship outside of the u.s.? q: how can i cancel my order? q: if i am unhappy with my purchase, what can i do? q: my order status says “new”; what does that mean? a: some orders that we receive must first be double-checked to ensure that it was placed correctly. we check location for ammo orders, ffls for firearm orders, and to make sure that restricted items (i.e high-capacity magazines) are not being shipped into states that forbid them. most times, when an order moves out of this status, it is getting ready to ship. q: what are your retail hours? a: our showroom is open monday to friday 10am-7pm and saturday 10am-6pm. q: why must you be at least 21 years old to purchase even rifle ammunition from you? a: it is aim’s policy that you must be at least 21 to receive any ammunition from us.  we have had problems in the past with what is considered long gun ammo and what is considered handgun ammo in some states, so as of now we only ship ammunition to those above 21. q: do you offer any quantity or volume discounts? a: yes.  quantity/volume discounts are unique to each item and are posted online if available.  sometimes, unpublished discounts may apply when making a large enough purchase (think whole pallets of ammo, not individual cases).  please call us toll-free 888-748-5252 to email us at [email protected] for more details. q: what does “hand pick” mean? a: we may offer a  handpick option on many of our firearms.  if you choose this option, our staff will take the time to examine some of the same item ordered and then choose the cosmetically best one of the few checked.  this does not mean you will get a completely better condition.  for example: handpicking a very-good swiss k31 will not necessarily give you an excellent condition swiss k31.  we can handpick for certain manufacturers, dates, and other details subject to availability. if you don't see an option for a handpick on an item, then we don't currently offer one. q: do you have any dealers in my area on file already? a: aim has created a simple way to locate a dealer in your area who is willing to process a firearm(s) transfer via the aim ffl dealer network. each of the ffl dealers in the network has already agreed to transfer firearms to you, the consumer, for a specified fee(s). simply locate a dealer in your area, carefully review the dealer’s terms and fees and then complete your order. the firearm(s) will be shipped to the business address of the dealer with your name and contact number attached. q: what is a c&r/curio & relic/03 license? a: a type 03 curio and relic (c&r) license is a type of federal firearms license (ffl) issued by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (atf).  c&r holders may receive certain eligible firearms directly to their door but does not permit the holder to deal firearms or act as a transfer agent. atf curio and relic faq orders can be picked up monday through friday from 10am – 7pm and saturdays from 10am - 6pm in our showroom.  for firearms you must bring your driver’s license with you and it must contain your current address. you must be a resident of ohio and at least 21 years of age to pickup handguns, frames/receivers, and pistol grip only shotguns. you must be at least 18 years of age to purchase long guns (rifles and shotguns). q: what forms of payment do you accept?
