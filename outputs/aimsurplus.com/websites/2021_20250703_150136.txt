specially to your order and your shipping address.  currently we have shipping options with usps and ups. shipping times orders typically ship within 1-2 business days after the order is placed, but high volume periods can change shipping times drastically.  you will receive an email notification providing you with the tracking number when the order ships. shipping to multiple addresses you will have the option to select a different shipping address for each item on your order.  multiple shipping addresses will increase shipping costs. items with lithium batteries optics, lights, and any other items that come with a lithium battery will only ship usps* (with the battery). ups is now charging additional hazmat fees for packages containing lithium batteries.  orders that contain ammunition and an item or items with lithium batteries must ship separately.  ammunition will ship via ups ground, and the optic/electronic item will ship via usps. expedited shipping all items except ammunition* can be upgraded to expedited shipping for additional shipping charges. *optics, lights, and any other items that come with a lithium battery may ship via ups 2nd day or next day (for applicable extra charges), but the batteries will not be included. shipping insurance our top priority is making sure your package arrives safe.  during checkout you will have the opportunity to
