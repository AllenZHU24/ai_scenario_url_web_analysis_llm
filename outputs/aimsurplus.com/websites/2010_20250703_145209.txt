a: it is aim’s policy that you must be at least 21 to receive any ammunition from us.  we have had problems in the past with what is considered long gun ammo and what is considered handgun ammo in some states, so as of now we only ship ammunition to those above 21. q: do you offer any quantity or volume discounts? a: yes.  quantity/volume discounts are unique to each item and are posted online if available.  sometimes, unpublished discounts may apply when making a large enough purchase.  please call us toll-free 888-748-5252 to email us at sales@aimsurplus.com for more details. q: what does “hand pick” mean? a: we offer a $10 handpick option on many of our firearms.  if you choose this option, our shipping staff will take the time to examine 5 of the same item ordered and then choose the cosmetically best one of the 5.  this does not mean you will get a completely better condition.  for example: handpicking a very-good swiss k31 will not necessarily give you an excellent condition swiss k31.  we can handpick for certain manufacturers, dates, and other details subject to availability.  such requests must be made over the phone and may not be available in some circumstances. q: do you have any dealers in my area on file already? a: we currently do not have a list of dealers who are willing to do transfers (although we hope to offer this service in the future).  the best thing to do is to call around to local dealers or pawn shops and see if they are willing to do the transfer for you and how much they will charge.  once you have a willing dealer, have them fax or email us a copy of their ffl, then you can place an order. q: what is a c&r/curio & relic/03 license? a: a type 03 curio and relic (c&r) license is a type of federal firearms license (ffl) issued by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (atf).  c&r holders may receive certain eligible firearms directly to their door but does not permit the holder to deal firearms or act as a transfer agent. q: i live locally, can i come by your store? a: almost all of our business is mail-order, but we do allow pickups of orders.  ammunition and accessories can be picked up on wednesdays from 9am-12pm and 1:30pm-5pm; we ask that you call the order in between 15 minutes and 6 days ahead of time.  firearms can be purchased on thursdays by appointment only and you must undergo the required instant background check at the time of purchase.  thursday appointments are set at a first-come, first-served basis beginning the friday before.  you must bring your driver’s license with you and it must contain your current address. q: what forms of payment do you accept? a: we only accept visa, mastercard, discover, cashier’s check, or money order.  if you want to pay with a cashier’s check or money order, we ask that you call us toll-free 888-748-5252 and actually place an order with us that way we can provide you an exact total and an order number you can reference on the check. q: how can i figure out the shipping costs before placing my order? a: to calculate the exact shipping costs, the best way to do it is to add what you want to your cart then start the checkout process.  once you fill in the required information, the very next screen will display the exact charges.  it is not necessary to enter in a credit card in order to get a shipping quote.  do not enter your payment information unless you actually want to place an order. q: how will i know when my order has shipped?  will i get a tracking number? a: if your email address is on file, you should get a shipping notice and tracking number emailed to you automatically once your order has shipped.  if your order is going to a dealer, however, we can only provide them with the shipping notice and tracking number, but if you call us 1-2 business days after you place your order we can let you know the expected delivery date of your order. q: how do i know if i am complying with my local and state laws? a: it is up to each individual to ensure that your purchase will not violate your local or state laws.  for best results, consult any applicable local/state ordinances, your state attorney general’s office, or a qualified attorney. q: can you ship outside of the u.s.? a: the exportation of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories is heavily regulated in the u.s. so we cannot directly ship any of our products overseas.  however, if you make all arrangements between a u.s. exporter and an importer in your country (including paying any applicable fees, duties, and taxes) we can ship to the exporter who can ship to the importer. q: if i am unhappy with my purchase, what can i do? a: we make every effort to ensure that your order is shipped accurately and that the product matches the advertised description.  however, if you are dissatisfied with your order for any reason, the following policies apply: no returns will be accepted more than 30 days past the invoice date return shipping charges are the customer’s responsibility if the incorrect product was shipped by our error, a prepaid ups shipping label may be issued please include a copy of the receipt along with a brief but detailed reason for the return and whether you would like an exchange or refund.  refunds will be issued in the same manner in which original payment was made (credit card purchases will be refunded to the account used to place the order and are subject to a 3% return fee). please note: we reserve the right to inspect all returned merchandise.  if we determine that a return was made without reasonable cause, or wherein our judgment the product meets the advertised condition, the refund may be subject to a 15% restocking fee. fees charged by a dealer transferring a firearm to the end consumer will not be refunded for any reason. these transactions are at the full risk and expense of the consumer. aim home page support pageshow do i buy ammo?
