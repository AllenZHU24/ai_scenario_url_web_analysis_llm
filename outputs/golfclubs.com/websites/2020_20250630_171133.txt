crush the ball off the tee and are played with either steel or metal shafts with shaft flexibility of amateur (for average golfers), senior (for older and higher handicap players) and stiff (for longer, stronger and younger players). the average loft is 10.5 degrees, played by over 90% of all golfers. ladies play with average or lady golf flex (depending on their strength off the tee) with a club head loft of 15 degrees.fairway woods are used for shots along the fairway and have a higher loft than your driver with a smaller club head to promote greater directional control.irons provide varying club head loft profile and are used inside 200 yards to the green.golf wedges are typically used from inside 75 yards to the green and have high club head loft angles to negotiate hazards such as sand traps and trees blocking direct angles to the flag.putters come in varying designs to provide a smooth roll with limited skidding on the green.when configuring your custom club consider your playing ability related to your handicap (your performance against the par on a course, usually in relation to a par 72 course). note that usga rules only allow 14 clubs in a bag.low handicap golfers should opt for a driver and at least one fairway wood, most likely the 3-wood. these players can benefit having a set of irons from 3 iron through pitching wedge (pw), sand wedge (sw), and putter in their bag.mid handicap golfer might try a driver, a three-wood and a 5-wood (or hybrid) for better control and consistency than harder-to-hit long irons. these players should select a 4 iron through pw, sw and putter in their bag.high handicap golfers should configure club selection the same as mid handicappers with an amateur or senior flex club shaft.what’s in a set of clubs?   latest
