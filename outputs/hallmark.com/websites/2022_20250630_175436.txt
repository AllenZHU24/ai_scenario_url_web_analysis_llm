first small collection of keepsake ornaments. what began as glass balls and yarn figurines has grown to more than 8,500 ornaments past and present, and a reputation for quality, craft, and above all, spirit. along the way, keepsake ornament collectors began to search for the stories behind their favorite ornaments—so in 1987, the keepsake ornament club (koc) was founded to give our biggest fans the sneak peeks and exclusives they still enjoy all year round. today, artistic innovations and light, sound and motion bring a new kind of magic to our ornaments—the kind that creates moments of wonder you’ll want to relive year after year. after all, keepsake ornaments are about creating, capturing and keeping memories, and that’s where real holiday magic begins. sign up for emails, offers
