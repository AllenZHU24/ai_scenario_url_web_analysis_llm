house filters remove contaminants: sediment pre-filter: the sediment pre-filter catches rust, dirt, debris, and silt that may be present in your water. removing these contaminants improves the quality of your water and helps protect the filtration system from clogging. activated carbon: the activated carbon media reduces chlorine. copper-zinc (kdf) media: aids in the reduction of chlorine, extends the life of your system, and inhibits bacteria and algae growth. post-filter: the post-filter reduces any remaining sediment and organic particles. whole house water filtration system benefits whole house water filters are ideal if you want filtered water throughout your home, including for showers, bathroom sinks, and running appliances like your washing machine and dishwasher. even if you only want filtered water from the sinks in your home, a whole house system can be cost effective and time efficient versus purchasing several under sink or countertop filters that need to be installed and maintained. here are key benefits of an aquasana whole home water filter system: reduce contaminants in your water get healthier skin and hair improve the flavor and quality of your food and drinks provide healthier water for your pets and plants enjoy brighter, longer-lasting clothes by removing chlorine breathe easier by removing chemicals that evaporate in steam upgrade your whole house water filtration system beyond the base model, our whole house water filtration systems can also be customized with the following optional upgrades: salt-free water conditioner: prevents minerals from binding and forming scale buildup, which can damage pipes, appliances, and negatively affect the quality of your water. uv filter: uses ultraviolet light to sterilize 99.99% of viruses and bacteria and 99% of chlorine-resistant cysts. pro-grade bypass kit: includes upgraded brass fittings and a bypass valve that makes your home water filtration system easier to install and maintain, a larger pre-filter, and a post-filter that catches any remaining sediment or carbon fines that may have passed through filtration. low maintenance pre-filter: upgraded pre-filter that lasts 3x long as the standard pre-filter, meaning fewer replacements. choosing a water filtration system for your home is an important decision to make for you and your family. if you have questions about our whole house

installed at a home's main water line to remove contaminants before they go through the house's pipes. by filtering contaminants at the source, a homeowner can get filtered water throughout their home. is a whole house water filter worth it? whole house water filters offer exceptional performance and can provide cost and time savings versus point-of-use filters if you want filtered water from multiple sources throughout a home. it may be cheaper and easier to install a single whole house system instead of a combination of under sink, countertop, and shower filters. this also applies to maintenance, as you'll only need to swap filters on one system instead of several. how long do whole house water filters last? the lifetime of a whole house system depends on gallon capacity and usage, but a general rule is that a system will last one year for every 100,000 gallons of filtration capacity. for example, our rhino® system will last for 1,000,000 gallons or up to 10 years (whichever comes first). compare clear all list of contaminants our patented claryum® technology reduces 78 contaminants – that's 15x more than the leading gravity pitcher filter – all while retaining beneficial minerals to give you the best-tasting, healthiest water. water treatment & disinfectants chlorine chloramines brxomodichloromethane (thm) chlorodibromomethane bromochloroacetontrile
