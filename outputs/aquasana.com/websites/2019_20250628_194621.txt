a shower filter attaches to your showerhead to remove contaminants from the water it disperses. these filters are individually installed, so you can choose to place them in as many or few bathrooms as you'd like. shower filters work by acting as a net to catch contaminants before spraying clean water from the showerhead. you can also reduce contaminants from your shower and bath water by using a whole house filter system to give you clean, healthy water from every faucet in your home. benefits of using a shower filter tap water can contain chlorine and synthetic chemicals that are harsh on your hair and skin. these substances are associated with excessive drying, which damages the skin and causes hair to lose its shine. feel the difference with an aquasana shower filter, which removes 90% of chlorine and other contaminants for stronger hair and softer skin. what to look for when choosing the best shower filter many shower filters are ineffective due to the use of outdated technology that prevents water from being filtered efficiently or does a poor job of removing contaminants. here's what you need to know when looking for a shower water filter: premium performance shower filter performance comes down to two factors: effectiveness — based on how well the filter removes contaminants flow rate — determines how quickly water is filtered so it can flow without reducing water pressure many manufacturers compromise on one of these areas to excel in the other, so do your research before buying. look for a filter that works with standard 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) showerheads to ensure consistent water pressure. make sure the filter removes chlorine in addition to other harsh chemicals as well. the aquasana shower filter excels in both critical performance factors. the aquasana shower filter works with most 2.5 gpm showerheads so you can keep your existing unit, and it uses natural coconut shell carbon to filter contaminants while its copper/zinc media enhances ph balance. superior design shower filters are visible when installed, so make sure the one you choose matches the aesthetic of your shower. think about the color and functionality of your showerhead, and whether you'd prefer to swap your old unit with a relaxing massage wand in white or chrome. design can also have an impact on performance, so choose a shower filter that uses an upflow system to prevent media channeling and clogging. utilizing an upflow design also increases water contact time with media for superior filtration at an exceptional flow rate. easy installation/replacement pick a long-lasting filter that's easy to install and replace when needed. avoid plumber fees by choosing a filter that attaches to the outside shower pipe and can be replaced with ease. aquasana's shower filter lasts for six months and is easy to install. don't want to keep track of ordering replacement filters?
