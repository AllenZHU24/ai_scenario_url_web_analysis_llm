well-being. our sole focus is providing best-in-class water filtration products so every home can enjoy healthy, great-tasting water. benefits of water filters unfortunately, the water coming out of your faucets at home can contain harmful contaminants such as chlorine, lead, and pesticides. aquasana's line of water filters work to reduce or remove unwanted contaminants before the water comes into contact with you or your family. there are many advantages to filtering your home's water. in addition to removing contaminants, filtering your water can help you increase your water consumption, help your body to absorb vital nutrients, detoxify your body, improve the taste of your cooking, give you healthier skin and hair, help the environment, and save you money. water filtration systems save you money bottled water can be expensive. use an aquasana water filter, and you'll save substantial money in the long run. and don't forget that bottled water is less regulated than tap water since the fda doesn't require bottled water companies to disclose how water has been treated or if there are contaminants still present. our products are also better for the environment because they are designed with minimal disposable plastic parts — a much better option than using single-use plastic water bottles that can end up in a landfill or the ocean. how effective are water filters? aquasana's state-of-the-art water filter technology is highly effective at filtering out harmful contaminants including heavy metals like lead and mercury, pesticides, herbicides, microplastics, vocs, chlorine resistant cysts, and pharmaceuticals — resulting in healthier, delicious drinking water. when purchasing a water filter, it's important to check for certifications or independent testing. at aquasana, all of our filtration systems are tested to meet nsf/ansi standards, and we provide detailed performance data sheets that outline our contaminant reduction claims. which water filtration product is best for you? at aquasana, we offer a whole host of water filter products, ensuring that there is something for everyone looking to improve the overall health of their home. whole house water filters for homeowners, whole house water filters are a worthy investment in your family's health. whole house water filtration systems provide filtered water from every tap in your home, even the shower and laundry room. our rhino® systems are available for both city and well water. our optimh2o® whole house system tackles additional contaminants including lead, pfoa, and pfos. under sink filters if you're looking for comprehensive filtration where you'll use it the most, our under sink water filters will immediately transform the water coming out of your kitchen faucet. our under sink filters remove up to 99.99% of up to 90 contaminants that can be present in tap water. the advanced claryum® filtration technology used in all our under sink filters is independently tested and certified to nsf/ansi standards. if you are interested in removing the maximum number of contaminants — including fluoride — our smartflow® reverse osmosis is tested and proven to remove 5x more contaminants than other ro systems, all while retaining beneficial minerals. countertop filters our clean water machine countertop filter requires zero installation and features our award-winning claryum® filtration technology. if you live living in an apartment and would prefer a filter you can take with you when you move, or if you want one you can take from room to room or from home to office, our clean water machine is a perfect choice. shower water filters shower water filters just may be the best kept beauty secret. unfiltered tap water can contain chlorine and other contaminants that can damage your hair and skin and negatively affect your air quality. aquasana shower filters reduce over 90% of chlorine with eco-friendly, natural coconut shell carbon and patented copper-zinc media. breathe easy and love your skin and hair again! ready to choose a water filter? choosing a system is a crucial decision for you and your whole family. here at aquasana, we are happy to help you
