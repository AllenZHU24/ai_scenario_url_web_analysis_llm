an increased intake of pure, healthy water will enhance nutrient absorption, weight loss, skin hydration, detoxification, metabolism and virtually every aspect of better health. natural, healthy weight loss can occur only by increasing one's intake of pure, healthy water. water is not only the number-one ingredient for a healthy body on the inside, it also plays the lead role in maintaining a healthy and youthful appearance on the outside. the quantity and the quality of the water we consume determine the body's ability to metabolize and shed excess fat and properly maintain the largest organ, the skin. weight loss is primarily the result of the liver converting stored fat into usable energy. this process not only requires sufficient water intake, but it can be greatly accelerated by consumption of an abundance of clean, healthy water. water also suppresses the appetite naturally and helps digest food properly. increasing water intake naturally speeds up metabolism and allows the body to better assimilate nutrients from the foods and nutritional supplements we consume, the result being natural and healthy weight loss. when we do not consume enough water, the upper and lower intestine have a reduced ability to absorb nutrients. the result is that most of the value of our foods and supplements is lost and passes through our body with out being absorbed. sugars and carbohydrates are absorbed and processed faster than other nutrients, so without an abundant intake of clean water, we can end up getting all the calories without any of the nutrition. food cravings are primarily the result of nutrient deficiencies; it's the body's way of telling us we need something. if our food is not properly digested, then nutrient absorption is not sufficient, and the body keeps telling us we need something in the form of food cravings."sixty percent of all americans are over weight. it's our number one health problem." -surgeon general a good indication of how much water is enough is to notice how much color is in your urine. any color at all in the urine usually indicates a water deficiency, resulting in reduced nutrient absorption and a slower metabolic rate. the quality of the water we drink also greatly impacts the body's ability to achieve or maintain a certain weight. one of the main functions of the liver is to act as a filter and eliminate toxins from the body. the liver performs this vital process using water in a joint effort with the kidneys. if the water we consume contains chemicals like chlorine, lead or agricultural and industrial pollutants, then much of the liver's energy is spent on filtering contaminants instead of processing fat into energy. many recent studies have shown a link between consuming chlorinated water and thyroid dysfunction, which can lead to weight gain. all weight-loss programs are based on reduced caloric intake and increased metabolic rate, both of which are naturally achieved with an increased intake of clean, healthy water. water is also the key ingredient to keep the skin moist, supple and resilient. the best way to moisturize is from the inside. drinking more water will result in softer, healthier, younger-looking skin. try it: drink an extra glass of water in the morning, one before lunch and one an hour before bedtime. you'll be amazed at the results! truly, water is the key ingredient for healthier skin and natural weight loss. aquasana home water filtration makes the healthiest water on earth affordable and convenient. recommended products:shower filteritem # aq-4100list price: $84.99view product detailscountertop water filteritem # aq-4000list price: $124.99view product details - select finish -whiteblackbrushed (+ $25.00)premium under counter water filteritem # aq-4601list price: $249.99view product details - select faucet finish -brushed nickelchromeoil rubbed bronzerhino® whole house water filteritem # eq-300list price: $999.00view product details customer service mon-fri 7am-8pm sat 10am-2pm (ct) 866-no-bottle866-662-6885 download our press kit click here to download the pdf all about water for life click here for more information contact us site map privacy policy international dealers become an affiliate water for life program copyright 2002 - 2011 sun water systems
