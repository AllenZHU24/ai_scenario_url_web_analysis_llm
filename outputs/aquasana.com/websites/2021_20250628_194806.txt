what aquasana filtration system do i use? not sure what filtration systems you're currently using? you can narrow down the choices by selecting a filter type. aquasana has three types of filter systems which include: drinking water, whole house, and shower. drinking water filters include all under under sink systems, plus the claryum countertop and the clean water machine, so check your kitchen to see what solution you're using. next, check your showers to see if shower filters have been installed at the head. finally, go to the location where the main water line enters your home (most likely the garage or basement) and look for blue tanks labeled aquasana or rhino® to see if you have a whole house water filter installed. once you determine which units need replacement filters, reference the model number on the data plate located on the whole house filter unit or on the drinking filter unit directly. for additional questions or assistance, please contact our customer support team. when should i change my water filter cartridges? the recommended replacement schedule for our filters varies by model and usage. select your model and determine the replacement schedule by looking at the installation guide. some models may require multiple components to be replaced, such as pre- and post-filter cartridges in whole house systems. keep track of when each filter is replaced, or make the process super simple with our auto-shipped, discounted filter replacement program, water for life. get regular water filter replacements shipped directly to your door water for life makes it easy to replace filters on time and without worry. whether you're already an aquasana customer or buying your first filtration system, water for life ensures you'll never have to worry about keeping up with filter expiration dates. the benefits of water for life include: auto-delivery when it's time to replace your filters 15% off the price of replacement filters free shipping extended warranty — free replacement parts any time you need them no contract to get started with water for life, simply add a product to your cart using the water for life price option, or reach out to one of our water experts at 866-662-6885 or support@aquasana.com. how to change my water filter? changing aquasana water filter cartridges is easy!
