be confident in your purchase. how our water softeners work our water softeners reduce hard water minerals through a process called ion exchange. here’s an overview of how our softeners work: pre-filter: the pre-filter collects rust, sediment, and silt in tap water. filtering these contaminants protects the softener against clogging and improves your water quality. ion-exchange: hard water passes over resin beads within the softener that are coated with sodium or potassium ions. as the hard water makes contact with the beads, hard mineral ions like calcium and magnesium get exchanged with the ions from the beads. hard mineral removal: hard mineral ions attached to the beads get separated and flushed through the drain as wastewater. regeneration: softened water flows through the resin beads and recharges them with a brine solution so they can be reused. benefits of a water softener hard water can negatively affect your health and your home in many ways. as hard water passes through your pipes, the minerals bind and form limescale buildup that reduces water pressure and can even lead to bursts. additionally, hard water reduces the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances by making them work harder. you may also notice streaks on dishes and increased damage to clothes after washing with hard water, along with dry hair and skin after showering. using a water softener addresses hard water issues and offers these key benefits: protect pipes from limescale buildup extend the efficiency and lifespan of appliances prevent streaks and spots on dishes reduce wear and tear on clothes get softer hair and less dry skin enjoy better tasting water water softener faqs what does a water softener do? water softeners function to remove hard water minerals like calcium and magnesium using a process called ion exchange. removing the hard water minerals prevents issues associated with hard water like clogged pipes, damage to appliances, spotty dishes, wear on clothes, dry skin and hair, and chalky tasting water. are water softeners worth it? if you live in an area with hard water, water softeners can help protect your pipes and appliances from costly repairs or replacements. softened water also lathers better with soap, helping you save money on cleaning products. in fact, our water softener can save up to $497 annually* by improving appliance efficiency, reducing repairs, and cutting the amount of cleaning products you need to buy. how long do water softeners last? your water softener should last 10 to 15 years. if your unit is facing more wear and tear, it could be due to improper maintenance or particularly hard water. a pre-filter – included with every aquasana simplysoft® softener – will help extend the lifespan of your system. * potential savings based on water quality research foundation battelle institute study. ** based on metered operation mode compared to standard time-based regenerated softeners. compare clear all list
