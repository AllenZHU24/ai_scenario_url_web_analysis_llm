not sure what filtration systems you're currently using? you can narrow down the choices by selecting a filter type. aquasana has three types of filter systems which include: drinking water, whole house, and shower. drinking water filters include all under counter systems, plus the countertop filter and the clean water machine, so check your kitchen to see what solution you're using. next, check your showers to see if shower filters have been installed at the head. finally, go to the location where the main water line enters your home (most likely the garage or basement) and look for aquasana-or rhino-labeled blue tanks to see if you have a whole house water filter installed. once you determine which units need replacement filters, reference the model number on the data plate located on the whole house filter unit or on the drinking filter unit directly. for additional questions or assistance, please contact our customer support team. when should i change my water filter cartridges?
