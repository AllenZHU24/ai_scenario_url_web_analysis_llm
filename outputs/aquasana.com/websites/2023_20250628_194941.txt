sink water filters for healthy, great-tasting water under sink water filtration systems are a popular way to get healthier, better-tasting water because they remove more contaminants than most pitcher-based options and even bottled water. these systems are installed below your sink, enabling you to instantly enjoy clean water straight from the tap without taking up valuable counter or fridge space. by connecting to your water line, under sink filters provide a constant supply of filtered water — so you don't need to worry about refilling a tank or waiting for water to trickle through a filter block like with a traditional pitcher filter system. clean, healthy water is essential. after all, you use water for so much — from washing produce to watering plants to filling your family's glasses and your pets' bowls. the majority of municipalities use chemicals such as chlorine and chloramines to treat drinking water for bacteria, but the process can miss other contaminants that may be detrimental to your health. this is why we recommend installing a water filtration system under your sink, on your countertop, or for your whole house. compared to most pitchers, aquasana's under sink water filters reduce 15x more contaminants. in fact, our tested and certified claryum® filtration technology removes up to 99% of harmful contaminants including chlorine, chloramines, lead, microplastics, fluoride, pfas, pesticides, herbicides, mercury, asbestos, and others from your tap water. choose the best under sink water filtration system for your home aquasana offers several under sink water filters to fit the unique needs of your home and family, and many include a dedicated faucet that dispenses filtered water. to help determine which under sink water filter is best for your home, start by reading your water quality report and consider what level of filtration you'll need to reduce contaminants present in your water. here's an overview of our under sink water filters that are great at reducing contaminants and protecting you and your family's health: smartflow™ reverse osmosis: our most powerful under sink water filter, this system combines claryum® and reverse osmosis filtration with our patented smartflow™ technology to efficiently remove up to 99.99% of 90 contaminants claryum® 2-stage: removes up to 99% of 78 contaminants including

faucet and removes up to 99% of 78 harmful contaminants all of our under sink water filters are tested and certified to reduce chlorine, chloramines, herbicides, pesticides, pfas, pharmaceuticals and more in your tap water. if you prefer a countertop water filter, we have options that also use tested and certified claryum® filtration technology proven to remove up to 99% of lead, asbestos, chlorine, chloramines, and more for a total of 78 harmful contaminants. how to install and replace our under sink water filters installing our under sink water filters is straightforward. each
