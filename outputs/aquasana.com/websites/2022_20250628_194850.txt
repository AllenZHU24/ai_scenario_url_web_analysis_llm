great-tasting water under sink water filtration systems are a popular way to get healthier, better-tasting water because they remove more contaminants than most pitcher-based options and even bottled water. these systems are installed below your sink, enabling you to instantly enjoy clean water straight from the tap without taking up valuable counter or fridge space. by connecting to your water line, under sink filters provide a constant supply of filtered water â€” so you don't need to worry about refilling a tank or waiting for water to trickle through a filter block like with a traditional pitcher filter system. clean, healthy water is essential. after all, you use water for so much â€” from washing produce to watering plants to filling your family's glasses (and fido's bowl!) at dinner. the majority of municipalities use chemicals such as chlorine and chloramines to treat drinking water for bacteria, but the process can miss other contaminants that may be detrimental to your health. this is why we recommend installing a water filtration system under your sink, on your countertop, or for your whole house. compared to most pitchers, aquasana's under sink water filters reduce 15x more contaminants. in fact, our nsf tested and certified claryumâ® filtration technology removes up to 99% of harmful contaminants including mercury, fluoride, lead, asbestos, and others from your tap water. choose the best under sink water filtration system for your home aquasana offers several under sink water filters to fit the unique needs of your home and family, and many include a dedicated faucet that dispenses filtered water. to help determine which under sink water filter is best for your home, start by reading your water quality report and consider what level of filtration you'll need to reduce contaminants present in your water. here's an overview of our under sink water filters that are great at reducing contaminants and protecting you and your family's health: optimh2oâ® reverse osmosis + claryumâ®: our most powerful under sink water filter, this system uses reverse osmosis to remove 88 contaminants (5x more than other ro systems) claryumâ® 2-stage: reduces the presence of 77 harmful contaminants including lead and mercury claryumâ® 3-stage: removes up to 99% of lead & 76 other contaminants and includes a pre-filter to tackle sediment and rust claryumâ® 3-stage max flow: an upgraded version of the claryumâ® 3-stage, now featuring a 44% faster flow rate and 800 gallons of filter life claryumâ® direct connect: an easy to install, fast-flowing water filter that connects directly to your existing faucet and removes up to 99% of 77 harmful contaminants all of our under sink water filters are tested and certified to reduce chlorine, chloramines, herbicides, pesticides, pfas, pharmaceuticals and more in your tap water. if you prefer a countertop water filter, we have options that also use tested and certified claryumâ® filtration technology proven to remove up to 99% of lead, asbestos, chlorine, chloramines, and more for a total of 77 harmful contaminants. how to install and replace our under sink water filters installing our
