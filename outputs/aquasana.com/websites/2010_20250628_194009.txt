"drinking water plants are old and out of date, and water supplies are increasingly threatened by and contaminated by chemicals and microorganisms.," natural resources defense council. "the way we guarantee safe drinking water is broken and needs to be fixed," carol browner, u.s. epa chief. one of america's leading authorities on water contamination, dr. david ozonoff of the boston university school of public health states, "the risk of disease associated with public drinking water has passed from the theoretical to the real." many illnesses that in the past could not be linked to a probable cause have now been linked to toxins in our drinking water. "while levels of these carcinogens (socs) in drinking water are low, it is precisely these low levels that carcinogenists believe to be responsible for the majority of human cancers in the u.s.," u.s. council on environmental quality. the use of pesticides and herbicides has become so excessive that they are now commonly found in household tap water and bottled water with alarming frequency. a 1998 study of 29 major u.s. cities by the environmental working group found that all 29 cities had traces of at least one weed killer in the drinking water. the report titled "weed killers by the glass" went on to say that "millions of americans are routinely exposed to one or more pesticides in a single glass of tap water." these first ever tap water testings found two or more pesticides in the drinking water of 27 of the 29 cities, three or more in 24 cities, four or more in 21 cities, five or more in 18 cities, six or more in 13 cities, and seven or more in the tap water of five major u.s. cities. in fort wayne, indiana, nine different pesticides were found in a single glass of tap water! as a startling side note, it was reported that in these 29 cities, 45,000 infants drank formula mixed with tap water containing weed killers and that "over half of these infants were swallowing four to nine chemicals in every bottle!" the tragic health effects of consuming these highly toxic chemicals are magnified many times over for small children because their systems are more sensitive and still developing. small children also consume a much larger volume of fluids per pound of body weight and therefore get a bigger dose, yet none of these factors are considered when the epa's maximum contaminant levels are set. the national academy of sciences issued a report in 1993 on this subject, stating "children are not little adults" and their bodies are less developed and simply incapable of detoxifying certain harmful compounds. another major flaw in the estimated risks of chemicals in our drinking water is the false assumption that only one chemical is being consumed. the regulations are set based on what is assumed safe for a 175-pound adult drinking water with only one chemical present and do not take into account the combined toxicity of two or more chemicals. in a 1995 science advisory report to the epa, it was stated that "when two or more of these contaminants combine in our water, the potency may be increased as much as 1,000 times!" it has been shown that areas with the highest levels of socs in their water supplies also have the highest incidence of cancer. jacquelyn warren of the natural resources defense council commented on the subject, "the one thing we know for sure about toxins in our drinking water is that the more we look, the more we find." find out what's in your water. learn the facts about bottled water and home water filtration. which is best? learn more aquasana pure water facts learn more about bottled water additional information » find out what's in your city's water » contamination: lead » contamination: drugs » chlorine & cancer » is tap water is unhealthy? » water quality reports recommended products:countertop water filtermodel # aq-4000view product detailsshower filtermodel # aq-4100view product detailsrhino® whole house water filtermodel # eq-300view product detailsunder counter water filtermodel # aq-4500view product details customer service mon-fri 7am-8pm sat 10am-2pm (ct) 866-no-bottle866-662-6885 download our press kit click here to download the pdf all about water for life click here for more information contact us site map privacy policy international dealers water for life program copyright 2002 - 2011 sun water systems
