agent may submit a rights request under the ccpa by emailing us at moc.ofhb@ycavirp. requests submitted by an authorized agent will still require verification of the consumer who is the subject of the request in accordance with the process described above. we will also ask for proof that the consumer who is the subject of the request authorized an agent to submit a privacy request on their behalf by either verifying their own identity with us directly or directly confirming with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. an authorized agent that has power of attorney pursuant to california probate code section 4121 to 4130 may also submit proof of statutory power of attorney, which does not require separate consumer verification. if you have trouble
