products home brands catalog about us my account log in about us bhfo started like many small businesses in america, with an idea and a lot of hard work. founders jon and stacie sefton began the business in the basement of their cedar rapids, iowa, home in 2003. both of them coming from a business background, they had a vision of building their own successful business where they could use their entrepreneurial skills. from day one, the seftons focused on selling clothing. stacie knew the brands well and knew what would be popular to sell online.  she soon formed a partnership with the most well-known lingerie company in the u.s. to help it liquidate its shelf pulls and returns. bhfo took off from there. the seftons operated the business out of their home for 18 months and then moved to a commercial warehouse. they continued to add brands, product sources and employees and their business grew rapidly. now, after three moves to accommodate that growth, the company calls a 250,000 sq. ft. facility in cedar rapids home, which houses more than 160 employees. bhfo offers brand-new designer goods from major manufacturers and upscale department stores at a fraction of
