once we capture payment, a watch generally ships to you within 1 to 2 business days, after the order is processed and approved. this gives us time to run the watch through our quality control process. if you need it sooner than that, let us know and we can work with you. do you offer free shipping? we do! crown & caliber covers shipping on watches coming to or going from our facilities why do i have to sign for my package? having you sign for your package is required by our third-party fraud checking service in order to prevent your watch from ending up with someone else. can i change the delivery address? yes. we can change your delivery address before your watch ships, but we’ll need to get the new address approved by our third-party fraud checking service. it typically takes about one full business day to get a new address approved, which may delay your shipment. i'm a seller how do i ship my watch to you? check out our "how to ship your watch" section below. what happens if my watch is lost or damaged in the mail? we hope this never happens, but if it does, your watch is fully insured by us while it’s in transit (as long as you follow our shipping instructions). and, we’ll work with you during the claims process to make sure you are fully compensated for the material loss. where are the ups labels for me to send in my watch? when you accept our offer, we’ll email you a ups shipping label with instructions on how to pack your watch to send to us. ups labels are emailed to you within one business day after you accept our offer for your watch. my watch is worth more than 5,000usd. how come my shipping label only says 5,000 usd? if crown & caliber is purchasing your timepiece for over 5,000 usd we may include a ups shipment receipt. we insure our packages through a third party shipping provider named parcel pro, and they are responsible for the insured value of a watch during transit. the amount indicated on the form that comes with a shipping label is 5,000.00 usd because that is the maximum amount that ups will insure a package. parcel pro has insured all watches for the purchase price. how do i get my watch to ups? when you are ready to ship your package, either schedule a pick up or take the package to an authorized ups shipping facility. you may schedule a pick up by calling 1-800-742-5877; notify the ups representative that you have a pre-paid ups package with a pre-paid and pre-attached shipping label. do not drop your package off at a drop box as insurance does not cover unmanned drop-off facilities. for security purposes, do not disclose the contents or value of this shipment when tendering your package to a ups store location. still have questions? email us how to ship your watch in order for your watch to be fully insured during transit, please follow the instructions below. print out your shipping labels (there will be two). grab two new, sturdy boxes (one will go inside the other). pack your watch, accessories, and signed customer agreement into the first box. tape the “inner box” label to the box. pack the inner box into the larger outer box. tape the pre-addressed label to the outer box. schedule a ups pick-up or drop your package off at an authorized ups shipping facility. do not drop off at a drop box. to schedule a ups pick-up, call 1 (800) 742-5877. still have questions about how to ship your watch?
