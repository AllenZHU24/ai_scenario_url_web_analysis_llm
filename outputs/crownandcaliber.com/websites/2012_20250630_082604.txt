antonit patek was a businessman and francois czapek was the watch maker. patek philippe made its first watch in 1868 - which included a perpetual calendar, split-seconds hand, chronograph and minute repeater. for an up-and-coming company this was an impressive feat. patek philippe watches are usually sold for a high price because of their unique look and updated mechanical features. the company was bought by the stern family in 1932. the company has come a long way from its humble beginnings – having produced over 40,000 watches in 2002 alone. patek philippe made an ultra-complicated pocket watch exclusively for henry graves jr. which sold in 1999 for $11 million. this was the most expensive timepiece ever sold. nine years later the company broke another record by selling the most expensive modern wristwatch. the sky moon tourbillion which was a platinum watch, sold for $1.49 million. another record was set in 2010 when a patek philippe wristwatch became the most expensive watch sold during an auction, selling at $5.5 million. the company is most adequately represented by its unparalleled values. these values have helped the company become the powerhouse they are today. patek philippe stands by their ten values; independence, tradition, innovation, quality and fine workmanship, rarity, value, aesthetics, service, emotion, and heritage. independence helps the company control its own destiny while pursuing a long term vision. by being independent the company has total control over its freedom. this helps the company make the best in house movements in the world. independence is the heart of the patek philippe spirit and guarantees continuity, durability, and trustworthiness. tradition: a value that goes hand-in-hand with independence is tradition – which allows the company a combination of experience, ingenuity, and passion that safeguards and revitalizes all of the company's discipline and skills. tradition helps the company follow a unique way of making watches that was established by the original watchmakers back in 1839. innovation assists the company by guaranteeing the most advanced and cutting edge designs and mechanical functions. the company has over eighty patents, including twenty of major importance to the history of horology. innovation also helps the company to evolve and strive to be the best watch company in the world. quality and fine workmanship allows patek philippe to develop, manufacture, and assemble the finest timepieces in the world. without this value the watches would not have the look and perfection the company strives for every day. rarity is important because it gives the customer the knowledge and the feeling that very few people have the same watch. it makes every watch special and unique in its own way. value is integral to patek philippe because the company is always trying to produce watches with the greatest value. aesthetics is important because patek likes to have beauty and art within the mechanical perfection and the outer look of their watches. patek philippe wants its watches to look good on the inside and out. service is a central component of the company that helps to sell its watches and highlights the fact that patek philippe is more than a company. it is a group of people that care. emotion is valued by patek philippe because all of the watches have bold emotion manifested in their design. all of these values are integral to this company and without them there would be no patek philippe. get a quote (800) 514.3750 send an email what we pay see all » calatrava
