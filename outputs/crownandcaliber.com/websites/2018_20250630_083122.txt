definitely the place to shop from, highly recommended.” rachel k. “the c&c team came through for my daughters college graduation. not only had the watch she wanted but they got it serviced and shipped out to me when they said they would. i would highly recommend using them. and the price was the best part, they saved me at least a $1500! thank you guys, you rock!” butch w. sellers + - “when i first inquired about my watch, someone from c&c immediately called me and got my information regarding the watch. they also were consistent with emailing me all of the information i needed to know. at first i sent a photo of the watch itself, and unfortunately did not have any of the papers or the box, but that was ok. then after sending my watch in to the company, they refurbished/polished up my watch and put it up for sale on their site. although it took a couple months to sell (which is understandable without its papers or box), c&c finally sold the watch for me!! they were super reliable and i am very happy!” taylor f. “when selling/consigning my watch with c&c, the process from start to finish was easy and seamless! the company is very transparent in their contract and they really made the process a pleasure to do business. i never once had the inkling that they were trying to bamboozle me or be sneaky in their dealings. i had nothing but a positive experience with c&c's staff, the contract and their terms and conditions which were reasonable.” violet a. “i've sold close to a dozen of my luxury watches on c&c and i must say that they are my preferred store/site to sell my timepieces. very professional, very clear, safe, accommodating and quick!” jay m. “i have to say that this was the easiest thing in the world. professional in every way. my watch was in the best hands. if you are unsure about c&c, wipe it out of your mind. this is the place to sell your timepiece.” siobahn d. “this is my 3rd time selling a watch though crown & caliber and i have been beyond pleased with their speed, customer service, and general care. i will happily do business with them in the future.” matt k. be the first to know subscribe to the crown & caliber newsletter crown & caliber who we are our mission scholarship unwound blog testimonials careers trusted partners in the news retail trade-in program buying & selling sell or trade watch financing watch insurance why buy from us why sell with us watch accessories our policies returns & exchanges product warranty shipping information terms of service privacy policy cookie policy help center faqs my account sizing guide contact us sitemap customer service call us 1 (800) 514-3750 contact us click here office hours by appointment only 5500 interstate north parkwaysuite 100 atlanta, ga 30328 instagram facebook youtube twitter pinterest accepted payment purchase with confidence top © 2015-2019 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites. except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
