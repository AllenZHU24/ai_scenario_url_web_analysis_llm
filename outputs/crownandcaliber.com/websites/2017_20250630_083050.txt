once we capture payment, a watch generally ships to you within 5 to 7 business days. this gives us time to run the watch through our quality control process. if you need it sooner than that, let us know and we can work with you. do you offer free shipping? we do! crown & caliber covers shipping on watches coming to or going from our facilities why do i have to sign for my package? having you sign for your package is required by our third-party fraud checking service in order to prevent your watch from ending up with someone else. can i change the delivery address? yes. we can change your delivery address before your watch ships, but we’ll need to get the new address approved by our third-party fraud checking service. it typically takes about one full business day to get a new address approved, which may delay your shipment. i'm a seller how do i ship my watch to you? check out our "how to ship your watch" section below. what happens if my watch is lost or damaged in the mail? we hope this never happens, but if it does, your watch is fully insured by us while it’s in transit (as long as you follow our shipping instructions). and, we’ll work with you during the claims process to make sure you are fully compensated for the material loss. where are the ups labels for me to send in my watch? when you accept our offer, we’ll email you a ups shipping label with instructions on how to pack your watch to send to us. ups labels are emailed to you within one business day after you accept our offer for your watch. still have questions?
