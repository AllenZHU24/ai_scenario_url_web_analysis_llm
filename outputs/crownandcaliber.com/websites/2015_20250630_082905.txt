most famous watch companies in the world. for starters, it was the first watch to the moon, as well as the first official watch for the us army in 1918. omega has maintained its reputation as one of the best and most well-known watches in the world by doing what it has done for over 150 years. a handful of omega wearers include john f. kennedy, stephen colbert, george clooney, and many other well-known american icons. it has been concluded through omega’s own studies that seven out of every ten people in america has heard of the omega brand. in la chaux-de-fonds, switzerland in 1848 omega’s founder louis brandt started a small workshop to sell small pocket watches. using the only money he had and parts from local craftsmen he began making watches. he sold his merchandise to customers around the world although his work has been rumored to be sub-par at best. after his death in 1879 his sons decided that his shoddy watches would not suffice so they moved into making all of the parts within their operation. this decision turned out to be a great one for louis-paul and cesar brandt as they moved the company forward. eventually, they re-stationed their operation to biel/bienne because of a greater workforce. today, the omega headquarters is still located in this same area. tragedy struck, and both of the brandt brothers died in 1903. although this was a great loss for the company - they still left a watch system that produced over 240,000 watches annually, with an 800 man workforce. the company was left to four young men; the leader was paul-emile brandt who kept the family tradition going. due to brandt’s work ethic and ingenuity the company rose in the ranks to one of the best in the world. by the 1970s omega was number three globally and number one in switzerland, competing with rolex but always outselling them year-to-year. as the 1980s approached omega found itself it a financial hole. while the quartz market was booming, classic watch companies were left in the dust to be eventually bailed out by swiss banks. after a dramatic turnaround, omega restored its brand and was selling a large amount of watches again. to top this off it began an aggressive marketing plan and many famous people began to wear omega watches. in the 1990s peirce brosnan wore an omega watch for every james bond movie. the omega company was mastering the sophisticated european look. later on, omega watches began appearing on athletes. omega was the official timekeeper of the 2006, 2008, and 2010 olympics. michael phelps, a world-class swimmer, is an omega ambassador and sports the seamaster planet ocean. some of omega’s most notorious models include the constellation, seamaster, speedmaster, and deville. all of the watches also come in another version for women to wear. the company has always prided itself on keeping the same class look from year to year. it is apparent that the omega design has not changed much since the 1930s, always keeping a very circular face and dark leather straps on common models. although omega has been considered conservative it has not failed to put out its own version of sterling silver linked watches and other newer looking models. to wear an omega is to wear a piece of history. an omega watch also represents style that has prevailed through generations of omega wearers. sell your omega omega
