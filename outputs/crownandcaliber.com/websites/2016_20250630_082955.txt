feedback? powered by olark live chat software our partners crown & caliber is defined by the quality of its partners. we are fortunate to work with the industry’s leading providers of shipping solutions, financing, venture capital, insurance, and risk management. watchuseek is the world’s foremost watch enthusiast community. we are partnered with watchuseek to provide our blog content on the bloggers united section of their site. check it out, and while you're there, peruse through the entire watchuseek site. parcelpro is our trusted shipping provider. we bear 100% of all shipping costs, and unlike any other watch buyer, we ship you a pre-paid and insured fedex package to keep you from having to leave your home. wells fargo has extended a multi-million dollar line of credit to the affiliates of crown & caliber, thereby allowing us the ability to purchase watches for as little as $500 and up to more than $500,000. national union fire insurance company, a subsidiary of aig, provides the transit insurance for all packages you send to crown & caliber. our policy is flexible and allows us to insure your watch for an amount that gives you comfort. powell growth capital provided the venture funding to get crown & caliber started. with a history of owning retail jewelry businesses, pgc has been an important partner for us. map international was voted the #1 large charity by charity navigator in 2011 – and is a valuable partner to crown & caliber’s movement. we are a member of the better business bureau and have enjoyed our status as a trusted partner with this prestigious network. once your item arrives at the crown & caliber facility, it is insured by chubb - a globally recognized insurance firm. you can be confident that your watch is in trusted hands. iwjg, or the international watch and jewelry guild, is the world's most active exchange for trading, selling, and buying luxury timepieces. their tradeshows are open to members only and crown & caliber is a proud member of iwjg. retailer trade-in program how does this program work? many retailers do not offer a trade-in program for watches, and we believe they are missing out on a huge opportunity. retailers using the crown & caliber retail trade-in program have a clear advantage over the competition. when a customer comes into your store with a watch to sell, your sales associate or customer simply fills out our online quote form, checking that they were referred to us by your store. within 20 minutes or less, a crown & caliber associate will contact your customer with a quote for what we will pay for the watch, based upon current sales data in the pre-owned market. some retailers choose to add an additional premium on top of our offer to be more competitive and secure the trade-in at their store. on average, a customer spends 2.75 times what their trade-in is worth on a new item from you. therefore, adding a 15%-30% premium to our offer puts you above market value which is not only more competitive, but also allows you to better serve your customer. upon acceptance, we’ll send you or your customer pre-paid and insured shipping labels to ship the watch to us. we inspect the watch, and then pay for it. however, instead of paying the customer, we send all funds to your store to act as a store credit for the customer. therefore, by using our retail trade-in program, your sales associate just generated a sale that would not otherwise have been possible. why use the crown & caliber retailer trade-in program? generate more revenue for your store through customer trade-ins differentiate yourself from competitors so your customers remain loyal to you offer a "debt-free financing" option (why should your customer finance or incur debt if they have an item of value to trade in?) work directly with crown & caliber, or have us work with your customer to purchase his or her watch, depending on your preference direct all funds to be sent to you, the referring retailer, in the form of store credit for the customer offer an online 'get a quote' option with the crown & caliber plug-in on your website qualifying items all watches shipping domestically must have an approximate value of $2,000 and be one of the watches we accept. scroll to top newsletter be the first to know! subscribe buy or sell with us watches we accept value of watches sold how it works international about us our story our team the movement scholarship experience blog/news retailers faqs style guide contact us get in touch info@crownandcaliber.com 1 (800) 514-3750 © 2016 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. term of service privacy policy free shipping return policy warrantywatch financingwatch insurance careers except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
