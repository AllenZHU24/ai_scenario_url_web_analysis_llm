testimonials - customer reviews - crown & caliber testimonials reviews watches for sale watches we accept rolex breitling cartier omega patek philippe tag heuer all other brands how it works why sell? the process testimonials international our results about about us our movement education center blog news retailers faqs quiz testimonials what people are saying so i heard back from them today. they emailed me and called me. given changes with gmail, her email ended up being filtered to my junk mail, so keep that in mind as you wait for a response. check your junk mail. so, i spoke with a lady named becky who was super helpful and professional (and very nice). i'm intrigued at the offer they issued me and will likely go further down the path. i'm increasing my rating to 4 stars at the moment based on my experience with becky. i'm will likely update my rating further after i completed my interactions with them. minh l. my experience selling my watch to crown & caliber was extremely positive. this is a company that you can trust. i sent them my watch and they sent me my payment very promptly. the whole process was very painless. jason r. i had a very positive experience with crown & caliber. they were prompt and efficient. they kept me informed about what was going on with my watch. just got the check today. the whole process took about two weeks. sure, i would have like more for my watch, but using c&c was painless. chris b. rachel and donna were both most pleasant to talk to on the phone. i regret only having the one rolex to sell to them. the two of them make the world seem a little less dim. thank you. tom m. if you're skeptical about selling an expensive watch over the intranet, you should be! there are a lot of shady characters out there. fortunately, crown and caliber isn't one of them. this company is a shining example of how experience, expertise, honesty, professionalism and good-old-fashioned courtesy can make the watch-selling experience a pleasure, even on the anonymous web. i recently sold my rolex oyster datejust with c&c, and the experience couldn't have been easier or more pleasant. i received an honest quote from them that was considerably more than i received from another web company that promised top dollar (no names here, but a clue: the first word is bob's and the last word is watches). i accepted the quote and c&c sent a very professional packing kit to me overnight. packed up the watch as per directions, sent the pre-paid package back, and received a confirmed quote within two days. (no bait-and-switch tactics here, either: received the same confirmed quote as the preliminary one.) accepted the quote, and the money was transferred directly into my checking account (i could have received a check if i wanted one) within days. doesn't get simpler than that! thank you donna, rachel, and the rest of the c&c team for taking what could have been a nail-biting experience and making it as comfortable and pleasant as possible. i would do business with you again at the drop of a hat. you get my highest recommendation! harris b. i had a great experience dealing with crown & caliber when i sold my watch. they were very professional in doing their estimate and in negotiating a fair selling price with me. in particular, donna, one of their associates was very helpful in explaining exactly how the sales transaction would happen, step by step. also, their shipping instructions were concise and thorough. i would gladly refer others to them for the sale of their high-end watches. great people to work with! william c. i recently sold my watch with crown and caliber after shopping it around to get the best price. they are quick on quoting you an offer and the offer was very fair. i would do business with them again. i had the pleasure of doing business with donna. highly recommend them! steve s. i live in california - recently i had a very good experience with c & c selling a watch. i would most certainly use them again. michael m. i went through crown & caliber to sell a timepiece i had and the whole process was fast and easy. i found c&c's offer to be very fair and within 2 days i had the fed-ex box to ship my piece. donna was extremely helpful and the communication was excellent. thank you donna and c&c for your help! peter o. dear caitlyn, katie and the team and crown and caliber, i received the funds within 24 hours of accepting the offer. i am impressed! you have been amazingly efficient, helpful and easy to work with. you delivered on your 'promise' and the process was simple, painless and stress free. we were a little concerned at first because everything was virtually done, yet i read and read the testimonials you had on your website and the reviews. that gave me confidence. i will highly recommend you and your team at crown and caliber anytime. when you have future customers, please feel free to refer me (email and phone number) as a resource to vouch for your business. much appreciated and thank you!

thank you! i highly recommend this company for any watch needs. lynn b. i sold my audemars to crown & caliber and they have great customer service and they are fair. the band was small and missing a 3 links. funny she said it was sized for a woman. i didn't take it too hard. we stroke up a fair deal and i am happy and pleased with the service. damon m. thank you so much to you and the whole crew at c&c. i received the check today as you stated. the entire process with cc was nothing short of outstanding. of course a lot of times we as customers are forced by our current circumstance to have to sell some of our cherished belongings, which is painful. but it is so nice that a place like cc exist, a place that is fair and doesn't rip you off. although what i received for my watch was far below what i paid for it, it was an honest, fair and generous offer that was 10x above what the local "rip-off" pawn shop offered, so thank you again. my highest recommendation to c&c to anyone who needs or wants to sell their fine jewelry. marvin j. just sold a vintage rolex with crown and caliber. i was referred to them by a coworker. it was incredibly efficient and easy. their website explained everything to me in advance and their communication throughout was excellent. i was never worried about shipping off my expensive watch to strangers based on their reviews and friends' recommendations. if i had another watch to sell, i would use them again without hesitation. melissa b. what a great experience. although i had to sell my beloved timepiece for personal reasons, the entire process from initial contact to payment was handled very professionally. i would not hesitate doing business with crown & caliber in the future. i hope you sell used timepieces in the future! thanks to donna, caitlyn, and katie! dave s. doing business with any company over the web can be both tricky and dangerous. trust me, crown & caliber is the best! not only are they honest (i had the check for my wife's rolex within 3 days), but their commitment to high communicaiton, throughout the process, gave me a lot of confidence in them. thanks donna & katie!

jack r. i recently (march 2013) sold my timepiece to crown and caliber after reading customer reviews. the offer was better than expected and the professionalism was amazing. constant email communication with 2 women that i could call in a heartbeat if i needed to. i accepted their offer once their experts had my watch (which by the way, was the same offer they quoted when receiving my pictures) and my money was in my bank the next morning. truly a real and reputable company. michele c. i recently sold my tag heuer watch with c&c. the process was easy, the team members were very friendly, and the offer and check arrived very quickly. the shipping process was very straightforward and secure. i was somewhat skeptical of doing business over the web to sell an expensive watch, but it was seamless. my offer from c&c was nearly twice what a local dealer was willing to give me on a trade-in on another watch. thanks c&c!
