with every watch we sell for you, we will send capital into a designated account that is used for purchasing and distributing treatments such as: deworming treatments: children with intestinal worms suffer from severe gastro-intestinal issues along with severe malnutrition which can lead to blindness and death.  we provide deworming tablets to these children which almost certainly saves them from this terrible sickness. dehydration-based treatments: it’s difficult for most americans to understand the sicknesses caused by dehydration, but this is one of the major causes of death of small children in africa. for many of us it would seem that a simple cup of water would cure this problem, but unfortunately this is not the case. 3 million children die of dehydration based sickness. we provide oral rehydration packets which can save such a child’s life. antibiotics: millions of children in the poorest countries die of simple illnesses that could be treated with antibiotics, if they were only available. 1 packet containing a 5 day regimen can save a child’s life. how can i learn more?
