how accurate is your initial quote? the short answer: very accurate. over 99% of the time, we stand behind the initial quote when we receive your watch in person. in other words, there's no bait and switch. crown & caliber employs 5 full-time valuation experts who do nothing but research the pricing history of our clients’ watches. in fact, we have built the most comprehensive database of pre-owned watches ever assembled. with over 10,000 individual watch models in our database (most of which have at least 10 selling points), we are more than likely to have comprehensive data on your exact watch model. if your watch value changes for any reason once it's in our possession, we will pay shipping and insurance to have your watch returned to you at once. is there any risk my watch will be damaged or lost? we have thousands of watches shipped to us from across the world every month, and have never had a lost or damaged watch. in the rare event that damage occurs, we insure every watch to 100% of the value of the quote we provided you. rest assured, our shipping process is safe and secure. can i email or call with specific questions? yes – our team is always available to answer any questions you may have. we recognize that a watch is a unique and often sentimental item, and we are there every step of the way to make sure you and your watch are treated with respect and care. contact us now. how does c&c make money? we charge a 19.5% consignment fee on every watch we sell, plus a small prep fee which varies based on the price of the watch. this is one of the lowest commissions in the industry (nearly half of an auction house, when both buyer and seller premiums are taken into account). it is important to note that we don't get paid unless we sell your watch for at least the estimated value. our sell-through rate is more than 95%. however, if we do not sell your watch within the consignment period, you will be given the option of receiving your watch back – inclusive of all the servicing, restoration, and cleaning we performed – at zero cost to you. that’s how confident we are that we can sell your watch for top dollar. do you accept watches from outside the us? yes – we are a global marketplace and have accepted watches from and sold watches to customers in over 30 countries and counting, a specific list of which can be found here. please get in touch if you have any concerns. see complete seller faqs this week's featured watches we've curated these authentic watches specifically for their 'cool factor,' and they've got a mix of durability, luxury, and uniqueness that's unparalleled. view watch breitling skyracer a2736234 $2,915 $3,000 view watch omega aqua terra master co-axial 231.10.42.21.02.003 $3,050 $6,000 view watch bell & ross heritage br123-heritage $1,845 $1,950 view watch rolex cosmograph daytona 116519 $15,065 $15,250 view watch rolex datejust 116231 $6,565 $6,750 view watch jaquet droz astrale grande heure j025033202 $13,250 $23,400 view watch panerai base pre-vendome logo 5218-201/a $20,250 view watch maurice lacroix pontos decentrique phase de lune pt6318-ss001-330 $2,450 $5,200 view watch breitling airwolf raven a7836438/f539 $2,750 view watch jaeger lecoultre amvox 2 concept q192t470 / 192.t.25 $6,665 $19,600 view watch parmigiani kalpa grande pfc123-0000102 $3,550 view watch zenith 18k el primero chronograph 18.2150.400/82.c709 $7,250 $18,900 view watch vacheron constantin toledo 47300 $14,000 view watch panerai luminor marina pam 165 $5,850 view watch bremont pilot alt1-p/bk $3,245 $5,795 we work with thousands of collectors worldwide, and would love to be your partner in building and fine-tuning your collection! get a quote now scroll to top newsletter be the first to know! subscribe buy or sell with us watches we accept value of watches sold how it works international about us our story our team the movement scholarship experience blog/news retailers faqs style guide contact us get in touch info@crownandcaliber.com 1 (800) 514-3750 © 2016 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. term of service privacy policy free shipping return policy warrantywatch financingwatch insurance careers except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
