as a company, we recognize the need for convenience and transparency in a pre-owned industry that isn’t known for either. so, we decided to do things a little differently: we stay on top of the market, letting the data, not gut feelings, determine pricing. we are a no-pressure environment. we just want to help and guide you, not force you into something you don’t absolutely love. every watch that comes through our doors is authenticated and performance-tested, ensuring that it’s running the way it was intended. we stand behind our watches and work. so every watch comes backed with a 2-year warranty. we’ve invested in a team swiss-certified watchmakers, experienced technicians, and refinishers. we offer a risk-free experience, which in non-marketing speak means if you don’t like the watch, send it back. oh, and the shipping and in-transit insurance is on us. our purpose our purpose at crown & caliber is to leave a positive and lasting impression on the lives we intersect. we do this by living out our values each day. our values how we treat our watches is an important piece of our company, but how we treat customers and each other is also of the utmost importance. this is why we have built our company around certain values. we pursue excellence and therefore the work we produce is excellent we have a bias toward actions that make things happen fast we proactively look for opportunities to love those that we encounter we believe success is found in working together and not alone why buy why sell be the first to know subscribe to the crown & caliber newsletter crown & caliber who we are unwound blog testimonials careers trusted partners in the news buying & selling sell watch financing why buy from us why sell with us watch accessories our policies returns & exchanges product warranty shipping information terms of service privacy policy cookie policy accessibility help center faqs my account sizing guide contact us sitemap customer service contact us click here 5500 interstate north parkwaysuite 100 atlanta, ga 30328 instagram facebook youtube twitter pinterest accepted payment purchase with confidence top © 2015-2023 crown & caliber llc. the smarter way to buy or sell a watch™. all rights reserved. we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites. except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values. do not sell my info
