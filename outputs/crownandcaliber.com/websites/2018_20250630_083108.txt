at the time of shipping, all returnable items are affixed with a one-time use sticker, which means that watch has been put through a rigorous inspection to ensure you are getting a genuine product. if you return the watch and the one-time use sticker has been removed or altered, we cannot ensure the watch has not been tampered with. because of this, we’ll need to put the watch back through our inspection process to ensure the next buyer is receiving a genuine product. i removed the red sticker. can i still return the watch?

crown & caliber sells watches on behalf of individuals across the world. we pay our consigners at the end of the 14-day return period, but we begin making payment arrangements well before that day. the 7-day timeframe gives us time to communicate with the consigner and let him/her know that there is a pending return. why does the watch need to be returned within 14 days? because we are a consignment-based business, we have a duty to help our consigners sell their watch. the 14th day marks the end of the return period and payment to our consigners will be finalized. will i receive a refund on overnight shipping? crown & caliber ships all watches with 2-day shipping. however, during the purchase process a client may decide to upgrade their shipping to overnight and they are assessed a standard fee. this fee is non-refundable if the watch is returned. what is the return policy for international buyers?
