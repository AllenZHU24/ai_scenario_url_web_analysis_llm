what can we do to give back to the community at large? with that in mind, we came up with a program that allows us to do some good with the watches we sell. map international is a global health and relief organization providing life-changing medicines and health supplies to people in need worldwide. map serves all people, regardless of religion, gender, race, nationality, or ethnic background. in times of disaster, map international also provides medicines and health supplies to people affected by crisis. as part of our charitable partnership with map international, crown &amp; caliber supports map’s medicine for the children program. this program is about bringing health and hope to children in resource poor countries through the delivery of life-saving antibiotics that are otherwise too expensive or unavailable. when you buy a watch, you save a life for every watch we sell, we put aside a portion of our profit for map international. that money pays for life-saving medical treatment. please watch this video to find out more about map international. antibiotics one packet containing a five-day antibiotics regimen can save a child from death brought on by simple illness. worm prevention for children, deworming tablets rid them of suffering caused by intestinal worms, which can lead to severe malnutrition, blindness, or death. hydration oral rehydration packets prevent the severe effects of dehydration, which is one of the major causes of death among small children in africa. providing life-saving medicine to children in need be the first to know subscribe to the crown & caliber newsletter crown & caliber who we are our mission scholarship unwound blog testimonials careers trusted partners in the news retail trade-in program buying & selling sell or trade watch financing watch insurance why buy from us why sell with us watch accessories our policies returns & exchanges product warranty shipping information terms of service privacy policy cookie policy help center faqs my account sizing guide contact us sitemap customer service call us 1 (800) 514-3750 contact us click here office hours by appointment only 5500 interstate north parkwaysuite 100 atlanta, ga 30328 instagram facebook youtube twitter pinterest accepted payment purchase with confidence top © 2015-2019 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites. except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
