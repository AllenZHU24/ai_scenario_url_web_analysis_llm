at the time of shipping, all returnable items are affixed with a one-time use sticker, which means that watch has been put through a rigorous inspection to ensure you are getting a genuine product. if you return the watch and the one-time use sticker has been removed or altered, we cannot ensure the watch has not been tampered with. because of this, we’ll need to put the watch back through our inspection process to ensure the next buyer is receiving a genuine product. i removed the red sticker. can i still return the watch? we understand that receiving your watch can be an exciting experience and you may accidentally take the red sticker off. from your conversations with our sales specialists to the messaging in our packages, we do our best to make sure you are aware of the red sticker, but accidents happen. in the event that you have altered or removed the red sticker, don’t fret—you can still return your watch. however, due to the inspection process mentioned above, you’ll be given a refund of the final sale price minus an inspection fee of 10% up to $500. return merchandise authorizations: returning a watch is easy. here is what you need to do: contact crown & caliber within seven (7) days from the date of shipment to request a return merchandise authorization (rma) number. email us at returns@crownandcaliber.com. once we’ve issued you the rma, crown & caliber will e-mail you pre-paid, fully insured shipping labels. please follow the shipping instructions to ensure the package gets safely back to our facility. the item(s) must be back to our facility within fourteen (14) days from original date of shipment. all returns must be shipped in both and inner and outer box. the return must include not only the timepiece but also the included watch roll, and any documents, instruments, links, straps, buckles, tags, protective stickers, boxes, authentication papers, manuals, or accessories included in the original package. you may re-use the original black crown & caliber boxed that was shipped to you as the inner box. if you no longer have this box, the inner packaging must be a new, unused box. the outer packaging must also be a new, unused box to prevent loss or damage while in transit back to our facility. once the item and all included accessories are in our facility, please allow us up to ten (10) business days to process your refund. provided that you’ve met the above deadlines and the red sticker has not been tampered with, we’ll refund your money back in full! what is the return policy for clients with watches outside of the us and canada?
