feedback? powered by olark live chat software we believe it is our responsibility to build more than a company. a speaker at an event i once attended asked a crowd of 100 or so people how many of them knew the names of their great-grandfathers. only 4 or so raised their hands. his point was that despite everything we think is important  now - our work, our activities, our accomplishments - if our great-grandchildren won't even know our names, what are we doing that will outlast us?these words are the fabric of what we believe at crown & caliber. we believe a watch represents the scarcest thing we all have - time. time has been described as "a mist that appears for a little while, then vanishes." our logo is an hourglass because we believe that each tick of a watch is an opportunity to do something that lasts beyond us.we hope that you will look at your watch in a different way - not just as a mechanism that measures time, but as a reminder to make the little time you have in this world count. gratefully,hamilton powell and the c&c team since our inception, we have provided $3 million worth of life-saving medicine to children in need. every watch sold on c&c helps give 12 kids another chance at a healthy life. giving the greatest gift: time a watch is unlike any other item we own. a watch measures the most important thing we all have: time. however, not everyone has time. each year, thousands of children in third world countries needlessly die due to sickness that can easily be avoided with the proper treatment. it is for that reason that we partner with global medical organizations that serve primarily third world countries in south america and africa. with every single watch we sell through our marketplace, we donate $25 through our global charitable partner, which provides 12 children with essential medical treatments. the donations are used for purchasing and distributing treatment such as: deworming treatments: children with intestinal worms suffer from severe gastro-intestinal issues, along with severe malnutrition, which can lead to blindness and death. we provide deworming tablets to these children, which almost certainly saves them from the consequences of such terrible sickness. dehydration-based treatments: dehydration is one of the major causes of death among small children in africa, with 3 million children having died of dehydration based sickness.  to combat this, we provide them with oral rehydration packets. antibiotics: millions of children in the world's poorest countries die of simple illnesses that can be easily treated with antibiotics. 1 packet containing a 5-day regimen can save a child’s life. we are humbled that with every watch we sell, we are able to make such a big difference in so many lives. thank you for helping us make this possible. scroll to top newsletter be the first to know! subscribe buy or sell with us watches we accept value of watches sold how it works international about us our story our team the movement scholarship experience blog/news retailers faqs style guide contact us get in touch info@crownandcaliber.com 1 (800) 514-3750 © 2016 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. term of service privacy policy free shipping return policy warrantywatch financingwatch insurance careers except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
