we charge a 19.5% consignment fee on every watch we sell, plus a small prep fee which varies based on the price of the watch. this is one of the lowest commissions in the industry (nearly half of an auction house, when both buyer and seller premiums are taken into account). it is important to note that we don't get paid unless we sell your watch for at least the estimated value. our sell-through rate is more than 95%. however, if we do not sell your watch within the consignment period, you will be given the option of receiving your watch back – inclusive of all the servicing, restoration, and cleaning we performed – at zero cost to you. that’s how confident we are that we can sell your watch for top dollar. do you accept watches from outside the us? yes – we are a global marketplace and have accepted watches from and sold watches to customers in over 30 countries and counting, a specific list of which can be found here. please get in touch if you have any concerns. see complete seller faqs why our customers love us seller “i was wary about selling my cartier watch and worried about being treated fairly. not only were the crown & caliber personnel surprisingly professional -- each and every one i interacted with -- i felt very comfortable with the entire process. i would definitely use crown & caliber again.” john f. buyer “my experience with crown & caliber was first rate. knowledgeable people, and excellent customer service. i would recommend this company to everyone.” helene d. seller “crown & caliber is an awesome company. i am pleased to say that they delivered as promised. professional and in a timely fashion. :) they delivered what they promised and i am pleased with their service. good place to sell your timepiece and in the future, a great place to purchase a good timepiece. thank you crown & caliber for a job well done.” anne w. read more we work with thousands of collectors worldwide and would love to be your partner in building and fine-tuning your collection. get a quote now scroll to top newsletter be the first to know! subscribe buy or sell with us watches we accept value of watches sold how it works international about us our story our team the movement scholarship experience blog/news retailers faqs style guide contact us get in touch info@crownandcaliber.com 1 (800) 514-3750 © 2016 crown & caliber llc. all rights reserved. term of service privacy policy free shipping return policy warrantywatch financingwatch insurance careers except where noted otherwise, the brands whose items we sell are not associated with crown & caliber, llc, and the brand names are the trademarks of their respective owners. we are an independent dealer, and are not an authorized reseller of any of the items we sell. except where noted, retail pricing information on our products are estimates based on multiple sources. read more about how we arrive at our pricing values.
