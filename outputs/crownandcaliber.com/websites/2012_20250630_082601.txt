1905 hans wilsdorf and his brother-in-law alfred davis founded rolex. the company was originally based in london, england. the two men started their business by importing swiss movements to england and putting them into quality watch cases. by doing this, the company did not need much capital to begin their brand. the company was also able to market its brand to british buyers without having to develop movements in house. in 1908 the company officially took on the name rolex and moved to switzerland for development purposes. the company was dubbed rolex because it was easy to pronounce in european languages and was able to be written symmetrically across european languages. in 1914 rolex was awarded a class a precision certificate, a distinction which was normally awarded exclusively to marine chronometers. this was an impressive feat for a company that was less than a decade old. in 1944 wilsdorf died and left all of his shares of the company to a charitable foundation. rolex watches have three interesting areas of discussion: automatic movements, quartz movements, and water-resistant cases. the automatic movements are powered by an internal mechanism that utilizes the movement of the wearer's arm. this method is one of the traits that rolex is most famous for, as the wearer’s arm swings back and forth in natural walking motion, the watch is actually powered by this kinetic movement. this made watch winding unnecessary, and provided for a more constant and more reliable time keeping method. the quartz movement is mostly utilized within the oyster collection. these movements were instrumental in design and implementation of technology. although rolex is not specifically a diving watch company, they do have a highly durable water-resistant case that is functional underwater. by offering these three functions, the company has made a name for itself in the category of precision and technological advancement. rolex has many different collections that have boosted their brand to the top of the luxury watch market. six of these that represent rolex’s variety are; the datejust, day-date, daytona, deepsea, explorer, and gmt-master ii. in 1945 datejust was released and has since been seen on the wrists of major celebrities in brittan and american. this watch has the ability to be waterproof, featured streamlined elegance, and date aperture on the face of the watch. along with the datejust, the day-date has also been considered a celebrity watch, making its way into hollywood films and paparazzi shots. the daytona watch collection was made in honor of sir jackie stewart for setting the land speed record. the gmt-master ii was made to be worn by serious travelers and professional aviation pilots. the submariner collection was made for aquatic purposes, but also with the intent to be stylish. by releasing such distinctly different watch collections rolex has made a name for itself as a top watch company. with this strategy in mind, rolex continued to release the newest and most precise pieces. the explorer collection was designed for pioneers with the spirit of adventure. these watches are made for tough terrain and travel. many consider the explorer to be the least “rolex” of the rolex watches. this has served as a compliment to rolex because of the fact that it recognizes that rolex can make more than just luxury watches. the milgauss collection was made for those who have a passion for science and discovery. the deepsea was created for professional divers - a hit for rolex. it is a testament to the power of the brand that people are willing to buy a rolex diving watch over watches that have been made by companies specifically for diving. by becoming one of the world’s most prestigious watch companies, rolex has found its way into every subset of watch culture. keeping in mind the rolex qualities of luxury, style, and precision there is no doubt why rolex is at the top of every collector’s list. get a quote
