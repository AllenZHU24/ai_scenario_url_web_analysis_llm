for several months, i have tried others, bu they do not compare. this is by far the best. great service at bulk apothecary too! amazingly wonderful by kd – 1st aug 2013 i have been using shea butter for over a decade, cant belive the money i could have saved had i found this website sooner. great quality, speedy delivery, i will be back for more.... super in soap! by marsha – 31st jul 2013 this butter is a must for any luxury bar of soap. i rub pure into my hands while i am measuring, and what a smooth treatment. very pure and easy to reseal and store. i'd add more stars if i could by quantina – 30th jul 2013 on a whim i thought i'd try to make my own shea product for hair/skin since the additives in some commercial products have left me very unhappy. i will never go back to commercial brands now that i've found bulk apothecary. the shea i received was such great quality and no funky smell. the packaging is very nice dark color that preserves the quality of the contents inside. i really appreciate this as i know oxidation can affect so many products, making them unappealing. so glad this was not the case. i will be a repeat customer and pass the word along to my friends/family. posted july 29, 2013, baltomore, md by kimberly – 29th jul 2013 i love my produce because it makes my skin feels extra soft. it also keeps my skin moisterized too. i will buy more in the future. the redefined shea butter is very soft and creamy; it makes it easier to rub on your skin. my children also love it too. great shea butter by shelly – 20th jul 2013 i loved this shea butter! no odor...i used it for whipped shea butter combined with cocoa butter and a couple different oils...very nice! will be buying again. great deal by enid – 18th jul 2013 i bought this product and for the price is great i pay for another one only 4oz and i pay 40.00 and smells a cocoa great deal for the price... great butter by brandi – 16th jul 2013 this is a great product at a great price. i recently made my own sunblock and this was one of the ingredients in the recipe. i looked at the natural health stores nearby and they had products that if pure were much more expensive but many of the reasonably priced ones were not pure shea butter. thank you for a pure product at a great price:) in a word incredible by mark schulman – 8th jul 2013 severe neuropathy in feet/legs with resultant calus and dead skin. this product worked a miracle. thank you. definitely worth it by kelly – 26th jun 2013 it has a light scent, and is extremely creamy. not runny and a great consistency.
