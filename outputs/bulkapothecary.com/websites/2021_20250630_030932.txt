we are located in ohio.  depending on your location, your order will typically arrive 1-5 business days after it is processed for most u.s residents. to keep you posted, we’ll send a shipping confirmation email as soon as your order leaves our warehouse that will include a tracking number for your order. we do offer 2nd day and overnight options as well for an additional cost.  we have also included a ups shipping map below so that you can estimate time in transit for any ground shipments. please note that all alaska and hawaii orders are not able to be expedited and will take between 4-6 business days to deliver from our warehouse once the package is shipped out. where does my order ship from?
