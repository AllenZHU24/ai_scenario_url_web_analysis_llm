that said, there are some exceptions: we will in 95% of cases price match custom quotes but they will need management approval first.  management will need the name of vendor and a copy of the quote in order to receive this management approval. we have a 100% guaranteed price match policy providing: we can only price match an item's normal advertised price.  sale items, closeouts or discontinued items are not eligible. price matches are only available for items we have in-stock of identical quality, quantity or size.  for example, we can only match the price on a 2oz. item if we sell that item in a 2oz. size.  another example would be county of origin.  we can not price match an australian tea tree oil to a chinese tea tree oil.  we also can't match a price on a conventional oil with our organic version of that oil. item we are price matching has to be in-stock and available for the price we are matching to any customer that wishes to order that item.  we reserve the right to verify this prior to matching a price. we can only price match one competitor per order.  for example, you can not place an order for 10 unique items and attempt to have us price match multiple sources on the same order. price matches are not eligible with a coupon code.  if we are matching the price of an item on an order, then a coupon code can not be used for any other items on that order.  instead, you will have to place a separate order for an item being price matched. price matches are only valid with large well established websites or stores.  we cannot price match small sites that are unknown where there is a possibility the website is not a real site that's goal is to sell product to the general public. price matches are not valid with auction or bidding sites such as ebay. price matches are no longer available on customer pickup orders. many of these orders require management approval and there is not a manager always on staff in customer pickup. shipping rates: at bulk apothecary all of our shipping rates and methods can easily be seen during the checkout process prior to placing your final order.  the rates displayed are reflective of shipping and handling.  in many cases, there is a large amount of packaging material that is used to ensure items are shipped safely to the customer and our shipping rates are reflective of those packaging and handling rates.  in most cases you will still find that our shipping rates are drastically lower than our competition because we take great care in negotiating the best possible rates with our carriers and pass much of that discount onto our customer.  in the event that you wish to handle the freight on your own, we have no issues with it.  simply choose customer pickup and call in your ups, fedex or freight number to our customer service reps and they will arrange to use your shipper number. × ok all majorpayments accepted facebook tiktok pin it instagram your order return policy shipping policy privacy policy terms & conditions help your account sign in my account view cart my wishlist checkout manage cookie preferences bulk apothecary about us quality best price guarantee blog contact recall notices resources fragrance oil performance guide candle wax guide wick size guide handcrafted soapmakers guild for soap making fda cosmetics national candle association personal care products council usa small business administration news & ideas sitemap copyright 2024 bulk apothecary scroll to top
