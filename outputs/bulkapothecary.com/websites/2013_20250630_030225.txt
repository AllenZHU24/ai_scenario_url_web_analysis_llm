product that is used in the creation of soap, detergent, paper, textiles and drinking water. it is a chemical base and comes packaged as a white solid. sodium hydroxide (lye) – uses and benefits having become an incredibly versatile and useful ingredient in everything from food preparation to drain cleaning, it’s no wonder that the world produced 60 million metric tons of sodium hydroxide in 2004. a brief overview of the many uses include: food – it can be used to wash or chemically peel fruits and vegetables. furthermore, it is often used to soften foods like olives or baked goods. cleaning – in liquid form, it is used to de-clog drains, dissolve metals and strip paint off a surface. it can also be used to de-grease stainless steel and glass bake ware. hair – in liquid form, it is mixed with other ingredients to create a hair straightening substance (often referred to as a “relaxer”). tissue – it is often used to dissolve tissue, specifically to break down the tissue of dead animals in carcass removal. paper – it is a key ingredient in the creation of paper from wood pulp. soap – typically for cold-process soap making, lye is essential. it can also be used in hot-process soap making when mixed with the appropriate fat and oils. caustic soda (lye) creates a chemical reaction known as saponificiation. this process is what breaks down the oils and turns them into soap. history of sodium hydroxide ancient egyptians and babylonians used a form of lye (using ash) around 4,800 years ago and recorded it’s use on a clay tablet. for much of history, water was run through wood ash then mixed with animal fats in a primitive attempt at soap making. lye wasn’t truly identified and understood until sir humphry davy discovered it in 1807. at first, believing it was one of the basic elements; he later went on to discover sodium. the term “lye” was an old english word meaning ‘wash stuff’. original lye soap was very harsh and often left the users skin red after use. this was because too much lye was used in comparison to the amount of oils. too little can cause the oils in the soap to go rancid and smell bad. when you find a good recipe for soap making, make sure you stick with it. soap making fats and oils, by themselves, do not mix with water. sodium hydroxide breaks up the triglyceride in fats and oils and turns the fatty acids into sodium salts. the salts reduce the surface tension in liquids and allow grease to be easily washed away with water. try making a pure soap with no perfume, fragrances, dyes or additives that can irritate your skin. using a pure soap with only the glycerin can cleanse and improve your skin condition – no matter what that condition is. pure lye soap will sooth insect bites and actually repel insects with its residue. try shaving your lye soap and using it as a laundry detergent, or rub a bar directly on a problem stain. lye soap has been found to be as effective as commercial products on the market. usefully destructive harnessing the power of caustic soda can be very useful to the resourceful individual. the same properties that convert oil and fats into soap can be put to use in dissolving the grease and hair that slows down (or completely clogs a drain). put a heaping tablespoon on a slow running drain and slowly poor in just enough water to dissolve. remember to allow for adequate ventilation, let sit for 10 minutes, and then flush with hot water for a couple of minutes to clear the pipes. mix one (1) cup of lye, one (1) cup of cornstarch and two (2) gallons of water to make an effective paint stripper. try some experimentation to give painted items a rustic or distressed look. make traditional soft pretzels by bathing them in one (1) quart of water with one (1) ounce of sodium hydroxide mixed in for thirty seconds. your finished product will be a dark brown, soft and delicious. the finest bagels are similarly boiled in a lye solution making them soft and chewy. many recipes attempt to substitute sodium hydroxide with baking soda, but reviewers agree that the ‘lye bath’ produces much finer results. pure lye make sure you know what you are putting in, and on, your body.
