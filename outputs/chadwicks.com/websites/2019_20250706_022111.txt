rave reviews “i appreciate chadwicks for being one of the few places where you can still get a dress for an adult woman to wear to work. i really like the styles of chadwicks clothing; it is hard to find styles for mature professional women because a lot of the styles are designed for young small women. i love wool garments, so please keep on selling wool clothes!” “i love the boyfriend sweater. it is nice fabric, yet lightweight so perfect for a cool spring and summer evening. the length is great as it comes down below the waist and hips. i was so happy with the sweater i ordered 3 more.” “great suiting separates. jacket is versatile. high quality and the price is unbeatable!! very happy with my purchase.” “i love these skirts. i have several in plaids and solids. hands down, best cut, best wool fabric, best bargain ever. i am still wearing some of them after 10 years.” “love my leather jacket! an amazing product for a great price. nice fit and very versatile.” “i love these leggings…i chose white…they are true to sizing, no bunching (wrinkling)…and they feel so good.” “i love these pants. they are a great year-round material and the leg width is perfect - dressy enough but not too wide. they are extremely comfortable and look nice all day. i have bought them in 3 colors.” get to know us about us contact us privacy policy visit our sister sites:metrostyle divider
