(see below) on american express cards, the cid number is a 4-digit number that appears above the end of your card number. (see below) what is the card security code? this is a security measure we require for all transactions. since the card security code is a number is listed on your credit card, but is not stored anywhere, the only way to know the correct number for your credit card is to physically have possession of the card itself. all visa, mastercard and american express cards made in america in the past 6 years or so have a security code number, while those in europe and asia have joined more recently. visa, mastercard and discover: this number is printed on your mastercard, visa and discover cards in the signature area of the back of the card. (it is the last 3 digits after the credit card number in the signature area of the card). if you cannot read your card security code, you will have to contact the issuing creditor. american express: american express cards show the card security code (also referred to as the cid number) printed above the imprinted card number on the front of the card (on either the left or right)**. ** please note, there are a small percentage of "plastic-less" card accounts for american express - corporate and purchasing card accounts. if you have one of these accounts with no amex card, please enter 5555 as your card security code. ***if your european or asian credit card does not have a card security code, you may enter 000 as your card security code. home contact us other sites site map
