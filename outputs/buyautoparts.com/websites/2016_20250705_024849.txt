ball joint failureoctober 24,2016with such a complex suspension, repairs are often difficult, time consuming, and expensive. many a4, a5, allroad, and passat owners will try to save money by only replacing the single control arm which exhibits the most wear. but this rarely, if ever, restores the stability of the entire suspension and many of our customers become discouraged when the symptoms of a worn suspension persist. read more...2002-2006 honda crv ac black death repairoctober 24,2016if you drive a 2002 – 2006 honda cr-v, you’ve more than likely had your share of problems with the ac system. it may seem like there is always a problem with it or that it’s never completely trouble free, right? after countless days in the repair shop and enormous amounts of money spent, you may start to think you’re going crazy. but rest assured that you’re not insane and the hidden culprit causing constant headaches is what’s known to many mechanics as the black death!read more...2001-2006 bmw 3-series ignition coil failureoctober 7,2016the engine compartment is a harsh environment on any vehicle. but in a high-performance german sport sedan like the bmw 3-series, it is even more so. and the incredible technology that these cars use to manage fuel delivery, timing, and ignition are often the components that break down most often. the heat, vibration, and moisture under the hood can be very damaging to the sensitive electronics that these systems use.read more...2002-2008 subaru turbocharger failureoctober 7,2016even cars with a meticulous oil-change history are not immune to turbocharger oil starvation as fresh oil alone is not enough to prevent it. most of the failures we see are because oil starvation when the banjo bolt filter clogs and cuts off lubrication. eventually, the turbo will fail and cause severe damage within the intake tract of your motor.read more...2002-2011 mini cooper power steering pump failureseptember 30,2016the 2002-2011 mini cooper and mini cooper s are compact cars designed not only for economy but to also offer a fun driving experience, so neither a pure hydraulic system nor a complete electrically assisted steering rack would be an appropriate choice for mini engineers. instead, the mini cooper uses a different system that is a hybrid of both hydraulic and electric steering systems which they call an electro-hydraulic power assisted steering. this type of system uses an electric motor to drive the hydraulic power steering pump instead of a belt from the engine giving you the best of both worlds: it frees up some horsepower by not being driven off the engine belts but still gives you the supreme steering feel that is so important in a well-handling and fun-to-drive small car.read more...2003-2014 chevy/gmc truck & suv ac compressor failureseptember 28,2016if your part of the country is hot even just a few days out of the year, you already know how important the ac system is when you’re driving. driving around town in stop-and-go traffic won’t give you enough cooling breeze even with the windows down and a long commute in the heat can leave you sweaty and your clothes stained. worse still is hot summer rain without functioning ac. in most modern cars the ac system is also employed as a dehumidifier and when it’s broken you can end up with foggy windows that are not only annoying, but also incredibly dangerous when you’re trying to see well enough to drive.read more...1996-2002 audi a4 1.8t turbocharger problemsseptember 7,2016the audi a4 had the distinction of being the first vehicle from the volkswagen group to be powered by the now legendary 1.8 liter 20 valve turbocharged engine which has gone on to be used in nearly every model line from each of volkswagen’s major brands. if you think about it, there probably isn’t a day that goes by where you don’t see a car powered by one of these engines. in fact, volkswagen is still producing it to this day while it continues to provide motive power in all of their brands as well as their industrial offerings. there’s even a version that is used in the fia formula two championship capable of 450hp!read more...2007-2012 dodge ram 6.7l cummins turbocharger problemsjune 29,2016halfway through the 2007 model year, dodge replaced the venerable 5.9 24v cummins diesel with a new 6.7 liter model, in order to keep up with the ever-increasing competition from ford and gm. in addition to a massive power increase, this also brought the ram up to emissions standards not scheduled to go into effect until 2010, three years later than it was released. with small updates, this engine is still in production in ram heavy-duty pickups today.read more...the 2016 honda civic 1.5 liter turbo: next-generation advancement or four-wheeled rolling grenade?june 8,2016the 2016 honda civic turbo represents a major change for an established platform. this is the first civic ever offered in factory trim that also features a boosted engine of any kind. previous versions of turbocharged or supercharged civics were only achieved through the aftermarket or honda’s race teams. this is, in fact, only the second try honda has made at equipping a production model with a turbocharger, the first being the acura rdx (more on that from the perspective of a parts professional later). being only their second attempt, the stats aren’t unimpressive: 174 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and 15.3 second quarter mile out of a 1.5 liter turbocharged engineread more...critical flaws in otherwise reliable carsmay 24,2016here at
