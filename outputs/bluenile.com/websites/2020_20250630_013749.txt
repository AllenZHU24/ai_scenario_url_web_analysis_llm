facebook. send us your feedback send us your feedback customer letters june 2019 diamond shopping made easy before finding blue nile i went to a local jeweler. i did this because i was spending a lot of money, and was nervous about getting a good deal. my local guy told me i was looking at $18k for what i wanted. i could not believe it so i started doing a little research, and found blue nile. the concept behind it made total sense to me. all the diamonds are gia graded and categorized. i was able to find two diamonds (stud earrings) that almost perfectly match my wifes engagement ring, for thousands less, 7 to be exact. my local guy was right though, because even though i only spent $11k, they came with a appraisal for $18k, which is what he claimed would be the cost. so glad i found blue nile. - keithnew hartford, ct june 2019 love my earrings! i purchase this stud diamond earring and was a little concern at first since shopping online for diamond and not being able to now for sure what your getting can be a little scary, but i was surprised and very pleased with the earrings. they were exactly what i wanted on a diamond stud earrings and the price was right. they were very clean and sparkling. love them? would definitely purchase from them again. - caroldanville, ca may 2019 love it! beautiful! as described. will buy from blue nile in the future. costumer service very friendly and helpful. - jaymiportland, or may 2019 i love these earrings. my "go to" pair! they were as presented. they were delivered quickly and they look lovely. - lauraowen sound, on load more
