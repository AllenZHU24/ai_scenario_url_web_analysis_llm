gold, silver or platinum and set with precious or semi-precious gemstones like elegant emeralds, regal rubies, luminous pearls and brilliant diamonds.what is the difference between fine jewelry and costume jewelry? while fine jewelry is made with precious metals and high quality gemstones, costume jewelry is made from less valuable, synthetic materials, including plastic and metal plating. in terms of price, fine jewelry is a bigger investment than costume jewelry and won't lose its value over time. with proper care, fine necklaces, earrings, bracelets and rings will far outlast costume pieces.is fine jewelry a good investment? fine jewelry is always a good investment, because quality gemstones and precious metals like gold, silver and platinum typically increase in value over time. fine jewelry is also a good sentimental or heirloom investment—many people who purchase fine jewelry never sell it, but rather pass it down through generations.what is the difference between fine jewelry and fashion jewelry? the term "fine jewelry" means that a piece is made of genuine gemstones and precious metals like gold, silver or platinum, like a timeless strand of pearls, a stylish gold cuff bracelet or a set of diamond stud earrings.our "fashion jewelry" is made of the same fine-quality gemstones and metals, but is designed with the latest trends and contemporary style in mind. fashion jewelry pieces might include an oversized ruby cocktail ring, a diamond bolo bracelet or a pair of emerald huggie hoop earrings.explore jewelry by categoryringstype hereall ringscocktail
