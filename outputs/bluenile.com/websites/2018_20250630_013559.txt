carat shape shape vs. price certification colored diamonds diamond cut the diamond cut is the most important element to consider when buying a diamond. the cut is the biggest factor in creating sparkle and fire, and without a high cut grade even a diamond of high quality can appear dull and lifeless. a diamond cut poorly and too deep can face-up smaller than it actually is. use our buying tips, diamond cut grading scale and comparison chart, and expert tips to help you choose the best diamond cut for your budget. buying tips cut is the most important of the 4cs because it has the greatest influence on a diamond's sparkle. even if a diamond has a perfect clarity and color grade, if it has a poor cut, it may appear dull. when diamond cuts are made with the proper proportions, light is returned out of the top of the diamond (which gemologists refer to as the table). if the cuts are too shallow, light leaks out of the bottom; too deep and it escapes out of the side. to maximize your budget, choose the highest diamond cut grade your budget allows. we suggest a cut grade of very good or better. grading scale use the slider to see cut grade details or view the cut
