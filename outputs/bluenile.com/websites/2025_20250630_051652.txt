price of your original diamond. 3. you may upgrade one diamond for multiple diamonds, or vice versa, so long as the price of your new selection is double that of your originally purchased diamond(s).4. your diamond must be in its original condition with the original diamond grading report. 5. any damage to the original diamond will disqualify the diamond from our upgrade program. 6. the blue nile diamond upgrade program is available for purchases shipped to the us. upgrades for other countries may be eligible on a case-by-case basis. 7. the original diamond grading report must be returned in reusable condition. fees may apply for any damaged or missing reports. 8. the credit value will be based solely on the value of the diamond. 9. for rings: if your setting fits your new diamond and is in reusable condition, we will set your new diamond in your original setting. if your original setting cannot be reused, it will be shipped back to you.10. for earrings and pendants: we cannot reuse your original settings and are not able to offer credit for them. they will be returned to you at the same time as your new order. 11. any diamond not originally set by blue nile must be
