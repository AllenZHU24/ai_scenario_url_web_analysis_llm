(cut is the most important 4c to consider) clarity refers to the tiny imperfections called inclusions. diamonds with the least and smallest inclusions receive the highest clarity grades. to maximize your budget, choose what's called an eye-clean diamond (grades vvsi-si1), which means it has no visible inclusions to the naked eye. clarity refers to the tiny, natural imperfections that that are present in all but the rarest diamonds. the less inclusions, the better the clarity. gemologists refer to these imperfections by a variety of technical names, including blemishes and inclusions. because these imperfections tend to be microscopic, they do not generally affect a diamond's beauty in any discernible way. grading scale use the slider to see clarity grade details or view the clarity grade chart below. i3-i2 i1 si2 si1 vs2 vs1 vvs2 vvs1 if fl heavily included i2-i3: clarity grades not carried by blue nile.inclusions are obvious, visible to the eye under 10x magnification. included i1: loose diamond not offered by blue nile.inclusions are obvious, visible to the eye under 10x magnification. see diamond jewelry slightly included si2: inclusions often visible to the eye.inclusions are noted, more visible under 10x magnification. see si2 graded diamonds slightly included si1: inclusions possibly invisible to the eye.inclusions are noted, more visible under 10x magnification. see si1 graded diamonds very slightly included vs2: slightly more inclusions than vs1.inclusions are minor, slightly visible under 10x magnification. see vs2 graded diamonds very slightly included vs1: slightly less inclusions than vs2.inclusions are minor, slightly visible under 10x magnification. see vs1 graded diamonds very, very slightly included vvs2: inclusions in top-half, crown.inclusions are so small, it is difficult to see under 10x magnification. see vvs2 graded diamonds very, very slightly included vvs1: inclusions in bottom-half, pavilion.inclusions are so small, it is difficult to see under 10x magnification. see vvs1 graded diamonds internally flawless if: very slight blemishes, < 3% of diamonds.inclusions are so small, it is difficult to see under 10x magnification. see if graded diamonds flawless fl: no visible blemishes, < 1% of diamonds.inclusions are not visible, rarest clarity grade under 10x magnification. see fl graded diamonds diamond clarity grade chart fl & if flawless, internally flawless under 10x magnification, inclusions are not visible, rarest clarity grade. see fl & if graded diamonds fl: no visible blemishes, <1% of diamonds if: very slight blemishes, <3% of diamonds vvs1, vvs2 very, very slightly included under 10x magnification, inclusions are so small, it is difficult to see. see vvs graded diamonds vvs1: inclusions in bottom-half, pavilion vvs2: inclusions in top-half, crown vs1, vs2 very slightly included under 10x magnification, inclusions are minor, slightly visible. see vs graded diamonds vs1: slightly less inclusions than vs2 vs2: slightly more inclusions than vs1 si1, si2 slightly included under 10x magnification, inclusions are noted, more visible. see si graded diamonds si1: inclusions possibly invisible to the eye si2: inclusions often visible to the eye i1 included under 10x magnification, inclusions are obvious, visible to the eye. see diamond jewelry i1 grade loose diamond are not offered by blue nile i2, i3 under 10x magnification, inclusions are obvious, visible to the eye. grade not offered by blue nile. expert buying tips select an "eye-clean" diamond - one that has no imperfections visible to the unaided-eye through the crown. an excellent value, diamonds of this clarity are much less expensive than flawless (fl) or internally flawless (if) diamonds, which are extremely rare and command higher prices. if you're considering a diamond with an si clarity grade, call to speak to a diamond and jewelry consultant who will review the diamond to ensure the imperfections are not visible to the unaided eye. next, learn about diamond carat weight. have a question?
