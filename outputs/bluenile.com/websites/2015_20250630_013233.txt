color colored diamonds signature round signature princess signature emerald signature asscher signature cushion diamond color key points color refers to a diamond's lack of color, grading the whiteness of a diamond. a color grade of d is the highest possible, while z is the lowest. blue nile only sells diamonds with a color grade of j or higher. color manifests itself in a diamond as a pale yellow. this is why a diamond's color grade is based on its lack of color. the less color a diamond has, the higher its color grade. after cut, color is generally considered the second most important characteristic when selecting a diamond. this is because the human eye tends to detect a diamond's sparkle (light performance) first, and color second. at blue nile, you'll find only the finest diamonds with color graded d-j. diamonds graded j or better are colorless or near-colorless, with color that is typically undetectable to the unaided eye. not carried at blue nile blue nile
