the site is informative to any male who has not a clue about jewerly in general. it made it so easy to pick what i was looking for whithout the pushyness of a salesperson. when i knew the shape of the diamond(marq. cut), and i could get it more of a round shape so it would not snag or get caught on anything. i was happy!!!! i have already suggested the site to over 30 friends and family!!! i wish more things in life are this easy and informative. thank you , dan reymer dan, northampton pa – december 2011 these diamonds beat my tiffany diamond this ring shocked me when i opened the box! it's cut and quality made the diamonds appear bigger than what i had ordered online. i was scared that blue nile had sent me a better and more expensive ring than i had actually ordered. it was unbelievable! the diamonds are so brilliant and fiery that i can't wear my tiffany engagement ring with it anymore. each of these diamonds are about 0.2 ct but it appears larger than my 0.4 tiffany diamond. your customer service was incredible and i love your website! every online retailer should provide the same shopping experience! thank you for demonstrating such excellence! anonymous – december 2011 tears from a new mommy! blue nile absolutely never lets me down. the quality, appearance and sparkle of the jewelry offered puts chain jewelry "stores" to shame. this bracelet was no exception. i purchased it as a "push present" for my wife, who just gave birth to our first child "autumn" on 12-8-11. her birthstone is blue topaz, and this was the perfect piece to celebrate her arrival while thanking my wife for her incredible sacrifice during the pregnancy and labor. as always with blue nile, the actual product has five times the luster and brilliance as the online photos. i found a quiet moment in the recovery room to present this to my wife, and she cried. and cried. and cried. my only wish is that the bracelet was offered in a white gold metal rather than silver, but that is nit-picking. this bracelet is incredible. thanks again, blue nile! you are making me one popular husband and (new) daddy! robert, damascus md – december 2011 best value, highest satisfaction exactly what she wanted!!! beautiful diamond in the perfect setting! i'm in the army in california and only went to a few local jewelers. since my time, and the jewelers' selections were limited, i found bluenile. leery about buying such an investment online, i researched and at the end of the process bluenile came out on top. the diamond is almost clear (e color), internally flawless, and the petite cathedral setting allows light in from all sides. everyone she shows is astounded by the diamonds brilliance!!! bluenile's customer service is on-point, and the perfect engagement ring arrived 3 business days after i ordered it. lastly... the price... bluenile beat the local dealers with a better price on a better diamond. amazing... the entire process. she's thrilled. i'm proud. could you ask for a better result? regards, cpl micah jones us army micah, wesley chapel fl – december 2011 awesome service! the service offered by blue nile is brilliant! the fact i was able to search for my diamond without the pressure of a sales person breathing down my neck was perfect and enabled me to get the best diamond i could for the money available to me. there are a number of settings to choose from which allowed me to select the perfect ring for my fiancã©! delivery was slick and well packaged. needless to say, my now fiancã© is absolutely thrilled with her new ring! i will definately be back! tristan a., bedford null – december 2011 just the ring she wanted i'm not sure there is any better testimonial i could offer. true, i cheated a little by getting her to choose the setting herself. but that didn't seem to diminish her excitement when i gave her the ring. she lit up as soon as she saw it, and has been beaming ever since. and to be fair it really is very, very beautiful. considering that the process was completely straightforward, the result absolutely perfect and the value indisputable, i can't see buying an engagement ring any other way. anonymous – november 2011 simply perfect.... this was the first time that i considered purchasing jewelry on-line. i have never heard of blue nile prior to my purchase, but so happy that i discovered the site. what an amazing company. first of all the earrings were delivered in perfect condition, and per the exact specs as described. it was a gift for my wife's birthday, and she loves them! customer service was amazing, and accessible 24 hours. we will definately purchase here again. anonymous – november 2011 "excellent service, even better diamond" i decided to go with bluenile after i heard many great things from a few of my friends who had used bluenile for their engagement rings. i was not disappointed in the slightest. the whole experience, from the moment i first logged onto the the site to the day i received the ring, was absolutely exceptional. the customer service was and is astounding. i used the live chat several times while deciding on which diamond to purchase. they answered all my questions and really helped my make a great decision. bluenile was also able to customise the setting free of charge. the diamond is of superb quality, and looks absolutely stunning, my fiancã© couldn't be happier. thank you bluenile for this amazing experience! dr. john p., ottawa on – october 2011 exactly what she had hoped for! great advice on phone about specific diamonds and what would look best for my needs. also appreciated that having an unlimited budget was not an expectation. i found the entire buying experience quite empowering which was very different from the retail jewellery store experience. scott, courtice on – october 2011 page: 1 of 1132 of 1133 of 1134 of 1135 of 1136 of 1137 of 1138 of 1139 of 11310 of 11311 of 11312 of 11313 of 11314 of 11315 of 11316 of 11317 of 11318 of 11319 of 11320 of 11321 of 11322 of 11323 of 11324 of 11325 of 11326 of 11327 of 11328 of 11329 of 11330 of 11331 of 11332 of 11333 of 11334 of 11335 of 11336 of 11337 of 11338 of 11339 of 11340 of 11341 of 11342 of 11343 of 11344 of 11345 of 11346 of 11347 of 11348 of 11349 of 11350 of 11351 of 11352 of 11353 of 11354 of 11355 of 11356 of 11357 of 11358 of 11359 of 11360 of 11361 of 11362 of 11363 of 11364 of 11365 of 11366 of 11367 of 11368 of 11369 of 11370 of 11371 of 11372 of 11373 of 11374 of 11375 of 11376 of 11377 of 11378 of 11379 of 11380 of 11381 of 11382 of 11383 of 11384 of 11385 of 11386 of 11387 of 11388 of 11389 of 11390 of 11391 of 11392 of 11393 of 11394 of 11395 of 11396 of 11397 of 11398 of 11399 of 113100 of 113101 of 113102 of 113103 of 113104 of 113105 of 113106 of 113107 of 113108 of 113109 of 113110 of 113111 of 113112 of 113113 of 113  show all    next our customers say it best more letters best value, highest satisfaction "beautiful diamond in the perfect setting!
