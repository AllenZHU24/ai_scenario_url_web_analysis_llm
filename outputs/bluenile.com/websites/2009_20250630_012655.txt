i had my doubts about ordering such expensive jewelry online but blue nile delivered an absolutely beyond expectations ring. delivery was secure and very quick, customer service was clear, easy, and exact. everything was as shown and stated and the quality was far better than the local 4 jewelry stores i visited, from ring weight to diamond quality. i will be ordering most, if not all, the rest of my jewelry needs from blue nile. arthur, chandler az – december 2009 my best purchase of 2009 buying an engagement rings is a big step and i approached it that way: with alot of research. in doing so bluenile had so much information i wasn't sure they actually sold anything. still hesitant to purchase something this expensive without having actually seeing it first i did alot of checking around different fine jewelery stores and retailers. no one could match the quality bluenile was offering for the price they were asking. so, considering i had 30 days to return the purchase if unsatisfied i ordered. every female that has seen the rings loves it. i took it for an independent appraisal and it was for $4300 dollars than what i paid (which was 3k less than retailers were asking). i'm very happy with my purchase and will continue to recommend and shop bluenile. marko, lanham md – december 2009 flawless experience! i'm so thankful that i found blue nile. no pressure and it was everything i could ask for from an online purchase, seamless and worthwhile. the selection is as good as any and i'm totally thrilled with my choice. no comprimising cost for quality. superior price and shipment and three days? what a deal! oh did i mention she loved it too? gustav, toronto on – december 2009 a beginer creating a masterpiece like a professional! fantastic. one of the nicest things about building your own ring is that it becomes so very personalised due to your own input. having educated myself on diamonds on your sight - it was lovely to choose the very best i could afford for my ring. i made an informed decision on what i wanted in my ring. the result is so very beautiful. thankyou! deborah, wagga wagga nsw – december 2009 her friends and co-workers keep visiting to see her ring! gorgeous ring and great value. customer service was exceptional. i would recommend blue nile to anyone purchasing a diamond. because i knew nothing about diamonds i wound up ordering a ring that was not exactly what i was looking for. customer service was extremely helpful. they helped me clarify what i was looking for and select the perfect ring. there were no extra fees and my new ring exceeded my expectations. margaret, lincroft nj – december 2009 great value and even the jeweler couldnt believe it. i was amazed at how beautiful it was and how fast it was here. my girlfriend loved it she couldnt believe i got her a ring because of the amount of money i have now but blue nile allowed me to get the ring i wanted for the price i needed. also the lady at the jewelry store that cheked it for me made sure to find out who i ordered from and i am sure is looking at your site now for her own jewelry. brenda, cresson tx – december 2009 the diamond clearly outshines the competition prior to blue nile, i had met with dealers across the nyc diamond district and had a good idea of what a nice diamond "should" look like. when i got my diamond from bluenile, it exceeded all my expectations, making all the diamonds i had seen before look dull and cheap. better yet, the bluenile price was far less than dealers were asking for comparatively sub-par stones! jeffrey, chappaqua ny – december 2009 exceeded expectations the ring beat expectations. i was very hesitant to order the ring online, most specifically because i was skeptical about making such a large purchase when i had not seen it with my own eyes. for those individuals shopping for an engagment ring who generally know what they are looking for in terms of the '4 c's," blue nile is the way to go. i found the exact ring i was looking for in the exact price range. i cannot help but sneak peaks at it when she is around, and, most importantly, she cannot stop telling me how much she loves it. the only downside is that we feel a bit gaudy showing it off. when members of our friends and familiy ask to take a look at it, i am almost embarassed because it looks so much more expensive than i paid for it. it is hard not to think that my friends who paid retail just didn't get the most for their money. anonymous – december 2009 the ring of her dreams! this is for the products stock # -9917 -9719 this ring is amazing! i bought it for my fiancée. i give it to her and she hasn’t looked at me since! all she does is look at there ring sparkle. she asked me to drive the other day so she could just look down at her hand. in any light it shines like the sun and sparkles like the stars! it’s perfect for the love of my life. the thin band is perfect for any lady that likes the more slender and petite look. i was afraid that it would be too petite but it’s the perfect thickness. i also bought the matching band! together they look like a million bucks! thanks! anonymous – december 2009 a painless process towards a perfect proposal. from the initial search to seeing a sparkling diamond in the open blue nile box, the process was very smooth, straightforward, and, dare i say, enjoyable! the only one happier than me about the results of my experience with blue nile is my new fiance. anonymous – december 2009 page: 1 of 922 of 923 of 924 of 925 of 926 of 927 of 928 of 929 of 9210 of 9211 of 9212 of 9213 of 9214 of 9215 of 9216 of 9217 of 9218 of 9219 of 9220 of 9221 of 9222 of 9223 of 9224 of 9225 of 9226 of 9227 of 9228 of 9229 of 9230 of 9231 of 9232 of 9233 of 9234 of 9235 of 9236 of 9237 of 9238 of 9239 of 9240 of 9241 of 9242 of 9243 of 9244 of 9245 of 9246 of 9247 of 9248 of 9249 of 9250 of 9251 of 9252 of 9253 of 9254 of 9255 of 9256 of 9257 of 9258 of 9259 of 9260 of 9261 of 9262 of 9263 of 9264 of 9265 of 9266 of 9267 of 9268 of 9269 of 9270 of 9271 of 9272 of 9273 of 9274 of 9275 of 9276 of 9277 of 9278 of 9279 of 9280 of 9281 of 9282 of 9283 of 9284 of 9285 of 9286 of 9287 of 9288 of 9289 of 9290 of 9291 of 9292 of 92  show all    next win a blue nile signature round diamond. appraised at approximately $5,000. to enter, just provide the information below. first name:* last name:* marital status:* single plan to be engaged soon engaged wedding date: mo. jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec day 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 yr. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 1989 1988 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980 1979 1978 1977 1976 1975 1974 1973 1972 1971 1970 1969 1968 1967 1966 1965 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 1947 1946 1945 1944 1943 1942 1941 1940 1939 1938 1937 1936 1935 1934 1933 1932 1931 1930 1929 1928 1927 1926 1925 1924 1923 1922 1921 1920 1919 1918 1917 1916 1915 1914 1913 1912 1911 1910 married wedding date:* mo. jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec day 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 yr. 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 1989 1988 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980 1979 1978 1977 1976 1975 1974 1973 1972 1971 1970 1969 1968 1967 1966 1965 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 1947 1946 1945 1944 1943 1942 1941 1940 1939 1938 1937 1936 1935 1934 1933 1932 1931 1930 1929 1928 1927 1926 1925 1924 1923 1922 1921 1920 1919 1918 1917 1916 1915 1914 1913 1912 1911 1910 gender:* male female birthdate: mo. jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec day 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 yr. 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 1989 1988 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980 1979 1978 1977 1976 1975 1974 1973 1972 1971 1970 1969 1968 1967 1966 1965 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 1947 1946 1945 1944 1943 1942 1941 1940 1939 1938 1937 1936 1935 1934 1933 1932 1931 1930 1929 1928 1927 1926 1925 1924 1923 1922 1921 1920 1919 1918 1917 1916 1915 1914 1913 1912 1911 1910 zip code:* * * required field receive special offers      and gift ideas from blue nile. read sweepstakes rules | close window blue nile international shipping to: united states currency is: usd about blue nile careers quality & value site map in the news awards & reviews customer services free fedex® shipping free gift packaging 30-day returns jewelry appraisals financing & insurance contact blue nile service@bluenile.com 800-242-2728 for phone orders, please mention: cqv3vt sign up for special offers   receive special offers and gift ideas from blue nile: become a fan and share blue nile with your friends give us feedback about blue nile © 1999-2009, blue nile, inc.privacy policy terms and conditions
