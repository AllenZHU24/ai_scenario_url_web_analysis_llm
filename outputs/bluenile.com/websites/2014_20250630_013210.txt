since if the gemstone is set in jewelry; this is the only part of the gemstone that is visible. more enhancements nearly all gemstones on the market, including gemstones offered by blue nile, have been treated to enhance their appearance. gemstones that have not been treated but exhibit desirable color and clarity command extravagant prices. some enhancement treatments are almost universal, are permanent, and require no special care of the gemstone, such as heat treatment to enhance color. other treatments are common, and may require more or less special care to avoid damage, such as infusion of colorless oil, wax or resin to improve clarity. more ring care every gemstone has unique characteristics. considerations in every day care, how and when you wear your fine jewelry, will dictate longevity. view our wear, care, and sizing page to learn more. more blue nile's latest news connect for special offers and news: thank you for your interest thank you! – you will be the first to receive emails about new products, special offers, and new features from blue nile. close invalid email please enter a valid e-mail address to receive special offers and gift ideas from blue nile. follow @bluenilediamond free fedex shipping–fully insured customer services free fedex® shipping 30-day returns free gift packaging blue nile credit card insurance help topics about blue nile careers blue nile experience investor relations in the news conflict-free diamonds our story share your feedback we would love to hear from you with any feedback about our website or products. give us your feedback! contact us online returns track your order service@bluenile.com 800-242-2728 © 1999-2014, blue nile, inc. | updated privacy policy | terms and conditions | site map
