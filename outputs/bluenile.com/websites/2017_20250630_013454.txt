finger) your ring should fit your finger comfortably; snug enough so that it will not fall off, but loose enough to slide over your knuckle. finger size changes depending on the time of day and the weather. for best results measure your finger size: at the end of the day and when your fingers are warm (fingers are smaller in the early morning and when cold.) measure finger size 3 to 4 times to eliminate an erroneous reading. avoid using string or paper to measure ring size as these materials can stretch or twist, yielding an inaccurate measurement. common ring sizes women’s rings typically
