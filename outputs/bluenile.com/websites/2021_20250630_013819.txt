ringhandcrafted in seattleour highly skilled artisans exceed industry standards with sparkling gia-graded natural diamonds, the finest-quality materials and outstanding engagement ring design at an amazing value.about blue nilefrequently asked questions about engagement ringswelcome to blue nile’s guide to custom engagement rings, featuring evertyhing you need to know to maximize sparkle- and your budget.as the largest online retailer of certified diamonds and fine jewelry, we can say with confidence that you’ve come to the right place. our selection, quality and expertise are unsurpassed. we’re here to help you design an engagement ring that reflects your intentions, your budget, and basically everything and anything that matters most to you.how many carats should an engagement ring be?+a classic diamond engagement ring with one elegant center stone usually weighs about one carat, while a slightly larger, two-carat diamond is also a popular weight. but there is no "right" size for a diamond or gemstone engagement ring. the best size for you depends on your budget, style and unique personality.how much should i spend on an engagement ring?+the amount you spend on an engagement ring is a personal choice that should take your finances and priorities into account. beautiful engagement rings are available for a range of budgets, and our experts are happy to help you find the best value at a price you're comfortable with.what should i know before buying an engagement ring?+when shopping for a diamond engagement ring, keep in mind that the shape and cut of a gemstone are more important than its size. even more important is your personal style and your lifestyle. choose a diamond ring that fits your personality, whether that's a pink cushion diamond in a vintage gold setting or a classic round diamond in a sleek and modern platinum setting. and if you're very active, choose a durable ring with a low profile.what's the difference between an engagement ring and a wedding ring?+traditionally, an engagement ring is what’s presented during a marriage proposal and a wedding ring is what partners give to each other during the wedding ceremony. it’s also common for an engagement ring to be more ornate than a wedding ring. one of our best selling combinations is a round diamond solitaire engagement ring paired with a diamond pavé wedding band. on the flipside, we have many customers who love to turn tradition on its head: some customers forgo the engagement ring altogether and choose matching bands. other couples double up on sparkle, with stacking rings that bookend the engagement ring.what are the different diamond shapes for engagement rings?+diamonds for engagement rings and other jewelry come in round and fancy shapes. with nearly 60 facets to reflect light, round-cut diamonds have unsurpassed brilliance. each of the fancy shapes—princess, emerald, asscher, marquise, oval, radiant, pear, heart and cushion—is beloved for its own, distinctive look and style. there is no single best diamond shape for your engagment ring—choose the shape that speaks to your heart.what metals are used in engagement rings?+a popular engagement ring metal among blue nile customers is definitely platinum (or white gold for people who want a platinum-look at a lower cost). over the last few years, however, rose gold engagement rings are a fast-rising trend. rose gold was often used in settings in the late nineteenth century, and is appreciated today for its naturally romantic appeal that particularly suits rings with vintage-inspired styles. most recently, yellow gold engagement rings are capturing the attention of people who appreciate the way this metal’s beautiful warm glow complements engagement ring settings with colored gemstones.what are the 4cs?+the 4cs are the four main quality factors that determine the value of a diamond: color, cut, clarity and carat. the sparkle of a diamond comes from its cut and symmetry, while the carat size determines how big it'll look on your finger. use the 4cs to help guide your engagement ring choice, but—as always—the "right" ring is the one that reaches out to you, whether or not it's deemed a "perfect" specimen by experts. how do i find my ring size?+find your ring size from home using household items, or you can request a free plastic ring sizer to make sure your fit is perfect. measure your finger at the end of the day when your fingers are warm, and don't forget to measure a few times for accuracy.explore engagement rings by categoryshop by styleantique-inspired
