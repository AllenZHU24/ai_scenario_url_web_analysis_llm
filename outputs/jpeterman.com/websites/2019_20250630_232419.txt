by breaking all the rules. our “owner’s manual” catalogue only featured one item per page, we used paintings of items versus photography, and each item was accompanied by intensive romantic copy. these were all things the “experts” said we couldn’t do. our customers have always felt like the j. peterman company was their personal little secret. some have even said it’s like a cult. i love that. since we started, our philosophy has been to help people “live their lives the way they wish they were” by offering distinctive, hard-to-find lifestyle merchandise for men and women inspired by our travels. the j. peterman owner’s manual, still showcasing content in superb artistic renderings accompanied by sophisticated narrative prose, was, and is, a one-of-a-kind experience, and something we’ve tried to recreate on our website. for those of you who only know us digitally, let us send you a catalogue. you won’t be disappointed. the j. peterman company represents an aspirational lifestyle. our selections enable our customers to feel transported to a world full of travel, adventure, and romance; a world where the uncommon journey creates the memories we cherish most. the company’s history is rooted in this aspiration and we try to live up to it every single day. i’ve always said that we took the road less traveled. i have a feeling that’s exactly why you and i found each other. j. peterman may we help you?
