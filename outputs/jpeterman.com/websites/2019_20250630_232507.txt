(or have a friend do it. serve sangria, as a bribe.) jot down your measurements and compare them with the body measurement sizing charts found below and on each product page. hat: measure circumference of your head where a hat would naturally rest (normally above the brow). waist: measure around your natural waist or, if you prefer, a little lower, where you may actually wear your pants. neck: measure the circumference of your neck. (add a little for your adam's apple.) seat/hip: standing, with feet together, measure around the fullest part of the hips. don't cheat. chest/bust: measure around fullest part, but with tape under your arms. you'll need a friend to do this for you. (more sangria.) inseam: use a well-fitting similarly styled pair of pants. lay them flat, with seam on seam. measure from crotch to bottom of hem. arm/sleeve length: your arm must be slightly bent to do this correctly. then, measure from center back of your neck, over the shoulder, down the arm, past the elbow (slightly bent) all the way to wrist. (your friend may be needed for this too.) "for men and women": what does that mean? they're men's sizes, in fact. on women, these items will be attractively oversized; sleeve length will be long.
