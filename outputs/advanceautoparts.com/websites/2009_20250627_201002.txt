alternative fuel know-how news you can use. . .on ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (ulsd) 1.	what is ultra low sulfur diesel (ulsd) fuel? ulsd was mandated by the environmental protection agency (epa) to be sold at all retail pumps by october of 2006. this new fuel is a reduced sulfur content formula of diesel fuel. sulfur content went from 500 parts per million (ppm) to 15 ppm in this new fuel. the reduction of sulfur is mandated to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions 2.	do new diesel engines require use of ulsd? yes, all new highway diesel engines are required to use ulsd fuels 3.	can i use ulsd fuels in an older diesel engine? yes. however there are things to be concerned with. ulsd fuel has less sulfur. sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen containing compounds are known to improve lubricity of diesel fuel. new ulsd fuels that have very low sulfur content will be drier and may not adequately lubricate the fuel system. potential problems include fuel-injector and/or fuel pump failure 4.	how can i add lubricity to my ulsd ? lubricity additives will not be added at the refinery to replace the reduced sulfur content. some diesel fuel additives do contain lubricity additives. all power service brand diesel additives contain a proprietary lubricity additive called "slickdiesel", for maximum fuel lubrication. 5.	i've noticed that my diesel engine has lost power since the introduction of ulsd. is this a result of the new fuels? yes, ulsd fuels have a lower btu value and thus when burned in a diesel engine will result in less power. the density of the fuel is reduced between 3-5%. the loss of power may vary depending on the engine, load and driving conditions. cetane enhanced products can offset this power loss. cetane is a high energy compound that makes the fuel burn more completely in the combustion chamber, resulting in more power, reduced emissions, and improved fuel economy. power service diesel additives contain "+cetane boost" to offset this power loss while also improving fuel economy and reducing emissions. 6.	do diesel fuel additives have to be ulsd compliant? yes. the epa mandates that all diesel fuel additives contain one of two statements depending on ulsd compliance. compliant is defined as the additives itself being less than 15 ppm in sulfur content. those diesel fuel additives that are compliant have this statement: this diesel fuel additive complies with the federal low sulfur content requirements for use in diesel motor vehicles and nonroad engines. those additives that are greater than 15 ppm in sulfur content are deemed non-compliant and must have this statement: this diesel fuel additive does not comply with federal ultra-low sulfur content requirements for use in model year 2007 and newer diesel motor vehicles or model year 2011 and newer diesel nonroad equipment engines. all power service diesel additives are ulsd compliant. information provided by: power service products, inc. home | en espanol | shop online | advance know-how | store locator | in store services | career opportunities weekly ads | rebates | specials | contact us | gift cards | newsletter sign-up | ready to save gas about us | press | events & promotions | investor relations | site map | terms of use: disclaimer | msds copyright 2005 advance stores company, inc. all rights reserved.
