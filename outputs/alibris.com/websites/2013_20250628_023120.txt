we know, right? according to the u.s. public interest research group, students pay about $1,100 a year on textbooks. that's some serious going-out money. the truth is, those high prices are driven by supply, not demand: professors select textbooks from publishers, bookstores order them, and students pay up. and while you can't control their price, you can get the exact same textbooks at much lower prices by buying them used online. that's where we come in! why buy used textbooks online? it's pretty simple: new textbook prices are out of control, and buying them used can save you a ton of cash. shopping online gives you access to more sellers and more choices, so prices stay low. through our network of independent booksellers, we connect you to millions of used textbooks—including international editions allowed for sale in the u.s.—with details about their edition and condition, so you get just the book you need at the very best price. what's an international edition? international editions are versions of textbooks or other books published for distribution outside the u.s.—and they can be up to 50% cheaper than u.s. editions. most international editions have different isbns than the u.s. edition, and while they sometimes have different covers and are printed on lower-quality paper, they usually contain all the same content. find out more about international editions. can i search for lots of textbooks at once?
