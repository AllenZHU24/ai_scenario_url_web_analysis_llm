can i access my ebook on more than one device? yes. you can use up to 2 computers in addition to 2 mobile devices via bookshelf at one time. you can revoke access on previous devices if you need to use a new device. do i have to pay sales tax on an ebook? in the u.s., sales tax on digital goods is based on your location. some states collect sales tax while others do not. we determine your location based on your billing address. you can learn more here. how long is my ebook rental? you choose the rental period as part of the purchase process. different items may have different rental periods to choose from, as determined by the publisher. similar to renting a movie or checking out a book from the library, the rental period begins within a few minutes of purchase, not at the time you access or start reading it. the item is automatically removed from your bookshelf at the end of the last day of the rental period. can i extend my ebook rental? no, rental periods cannot be extended. what is the return policy for ebooks and courseware? you may return an ebook within 14 days of purchase, provided: you have not viewed or printed more than 20% of the book you have not used any access codes for any included resources you have not previously returned the same ebook (you cannot purchase and return the same ebook twice) certain publishers have additional restrictions for returns: cengage unlimited: returns are not allowed on cengage unlimited packages. penguin random house: returns allowed within 7 days if you have not viewed or printed the ebook. harpercollins and harpercollins christian: returns allowed within 2 days of your initial purchase if you have not viewed or printed, in total, more than two percent (2%) of the ebook. hachette digital: returns allowed within 3 days if you have not viewed or printed, in total, more than two percent (2%) of the ebook. for complete information on returns, see the vitalsource return policy. more questions? go back to the main help & customer service page or send e-mail to customer service. subscribe now for coupons, newsletters, and more!
