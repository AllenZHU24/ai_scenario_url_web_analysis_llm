instruments were not as polished and as sophisticated as they are today. when accounting for the materials and the level of progress made in the early years of human civilization, one can still note that instruments did exist. music is there to express feelings and will usually have a sense of harmony. music has evolved over time and now modern societies have pop music, hip hop music, rock music, blues and other styles of music. new technologies have made it to where musicians and artists can find ways to express themselves and capture the essence of the moment in a wide variety of ways. why is music good for us? ▾ music is good for us for several reasons. research shows that listening to music is equivalent to working out; only in this case, it is your brain that is getting stronger. music stimulates the brain and helps to maintain brain health. researchers at different institutions show that it is best to either listen to music or learn to play music to keep the brain in great condition. further, since music tends to encapsulate and convey emotions, it can help individuals become more productive, relax, lower blood pressure, and improve their overall mood. since music is largely repetitive, it can also help to strengthen memory and improve or aid cognitive function in other ways as well. thanks to a wide range of new music that is present in this era, from hip hop music to house music, individuals can benefit from different sounds and browse by artist in their music cd collections to spark their creativity. why is music an art? ▾ music is an art because it can influence and convey human emotion in a creative way. artists in societies across time have been able to express themselves and capture the joy or the somberness of the moment in rituals and events with others. music is profound because it contains emotional power and it resonates with audiences. the artist or group of artists use their imagination, creativity, and their inspiration to create music that reflects different emotions and ideas. this form of art helps us to understand ourselves and the world around us in a creative manner. researchers note that music can easily be a mixture of science and art that contributes significantly to humanity. find out more about our broad selection of music offerings at our online store today. cds vs. vinyl: which should i buy? ▾ cds and vinyl records are both great options for those who want to listen to music at home. however, cds are ideal for listening to music while you're in the car. records are more durable than cds, meaning they don't scratch as easily, but they require a turntable. to play records, you can use a tabletop turntable with a built-in speaker or purchase a separate turntable and hook up your best speakers to get a better listening experience. cds have clearer audio than vinyl with less interference from the turntable. however, many people still prefer vinyl for its sound qualities, like richness and depth you can't get with a cd, but they're not easily portable, and you can't play them in your car. subscribe now for coupons, newsletters, and more! enter your email for coupon sign up let's get social help
