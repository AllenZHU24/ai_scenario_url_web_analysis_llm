helpful (0) brilliant (0) funny (0) by the book ladies 8 days ago i think the key is finding good books. some books are just boring and hard to read, especially for people who aren't fast readers. if a particular book just isn't doing it for you, stop and find another book. i've recently started reading young adult paranormal and they are usually quick and easy reads, that is if it interests you. i like easy reading because i tend to read quickly and i'm in a hurry to find out what's going to happen :) was this comment?

i love to read, but i only have about an hour or two per night. and i read very slowly. that's what 12 years of college did for me! as a kid i was a very quick reader, but majoring in 2 literatures and then going into graduate school for 6 straight years (2 years later) created a serious slowdown to my reading. i get style but rarely remember content unless it is nonfiction. oh, well. any suggestions would be great! thanks.ken mcleod was this comment? helpful (0) brilliant (0) funny (0) by jeaniecobb 8 days ago as a busy working mother my solution to reading more is always have a good book in my bag so i can read while i am waiting at the doctor's office or at a kid event etc. my favorite books for my bag are fun fiction that i can read in small bits. also my kids are old enough that they read for school (about 30 minutes per night) and so i often read at the same time and try to be a good role model for them. sometimes i get time to read before bed if i don't fall asleep right away. and on the weekends, i try and set asside some time to read and of course a nap. was this comment?

helpful (0) brilliant (1) funny (0) reply post reply cancel community guidelines notify me by e-mail with this post's updates by womanonamission 7 days ago sandeep, for me part of it is finding a good book and finding the time. i do a lot of reading when commuting to work on the train or when in a waiting room. i also tend to read as the last thing i do before going to sleep. the biggest trick is to find a genre you like and then go from there. if you are really busy consider magazines. there are so many niche magazines that i am sure there's something out there of interest to you.although i don't have one (& actually prefer bound books) you may consider an ebook or if you have an iphone consider using an app that allows your phone to function as an ebook. i recommend this because its portable and can be used in most settings.the main thing is speed is not the issue; as long as reading that is all that matters.good luck. was this comment?

helpful (0) brilliant (0) funny (0) by anne v 5 days ago you might try short stories - i especially like science fiction. i love to read, but i don't have much time except right before bed. short story collections mean i can get the "entire" story without falling asleep in the middle of chapter 3 ;-) was this comment?

helpful (0) brilliant (0) funny (0) by cheryl j 4 days ago hello sandeep -here's another idea. borrow or purchase copies of the book in text and the book on tape, and read along with it. for example, the kite runner, read by the author, will hold your attention and help you with the pacing. i agree with many others, too. fifteen minutes a day is a great start and the desire to do more shows the beginnings of what could become one of your greatest passions. reading is one of the keys to contentment. it can bring peace, hope, and growth. best wishes as you grow your skill. was this comment?
