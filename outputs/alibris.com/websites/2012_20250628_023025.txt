("the times"). impassioned, poetic and brilliantly written, "silent spring" is now recognized as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century. in it, rachel carson exposed the destruction of wildlife through the widespread and indiscriminate use of pesticides. she described the nests full of eggs that would never hatch, the rivers bloated with poisoned fish and the children killed by the very chemicals which had previously been lauded as miracle potions, and sprayed without reservation across the country. despite condemnation in the press and heavy-handed attempts by the chemical industry to ban the book, rachel carson's book directly lead to changes in government policy and inspired the modern ecological movement. hide synopsis find your copy buy it from $1.50 buy

on dec 13, 2012 the book was as described and arrived promptly. i am fully satisfied with this purchase. more dated by danita o on aug 2, 2012 this book was an important study at the time but it is very dated now more first class book by estibaliz on jun 1, 2012 chemicals are threatening the whole environment. plants, animals and human beings are in danger because of greedy and ignorance. the rise of cancer, and rare alergies and respiratory diseases could be exaplained by the abuse of chemicals. more a must read by earthtrek on jan 20, 2012 this book is a must read for anyone who cares
