available only for orders consisting entirely of items shipped by alibris, not for items shipped by an independent seller. back to top shipping service tracking your order if you selected trackable expedited, one day air, or two day air as your order's shipping method, you can track its progress after it has shipped. to do so, click the account link in the upper-right menu of our web site. then enter your password to review and track such purchases. other shipping methods are not trackable. independent seller shipping & handling items shipped by our independent sellers are not eligible for super value shipping (svs). as a result, shipping and handling charges are applied to items listed by independent sellers, even if other items in your shopping cart do qualify for super value shipping. however, you may receive consolidated shipping discounts when you purchase more than one item from the same independent seller in the same order. because they all ship via trackable expedited shipping, rentals are ineligible for consolidated shipping. estimating total shipping time the amount of time your order will take to reach you depends on the items you're ordering, where the seller is located, and where and how you want the order shipped. items listed as shipping from alibris are normally sent on the first business day after you order them. items listed as shipping from independent sellers usually take 2 to 3 days to process before shipment, and items from non-u.s. and non-canadian sellers may take up to three weeks to process. once you have selected your items, please use the tables above to estimate the total delivery time to your location. items from non-u.s. and non-canadian sellers take longer when you order items from sellers outside the united states or canada, they ship your merchandise to our warehouse first. we then verify and check your order before shipping it on to you, whether you're located inside or outside of the u.s. this process takes some extra time, but it helps to ensure that your order is accurate when it reaches you. rental items and shipping all rental items ship only via trackable expedited shipping. that means that anything you rent from our independent sellers should arrive faster and will include a tracking number in your account, so you can keep an eye on its shipping progress. import duties and taxes on orders shipped between countries if you are the recipient of an order shipped between countries, you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are assessed when the package reaches your country. you are responsible for these and any other additional charges. most carriers assess applicable duties and taxes when the shipment from us arrives in your country. if more money is owed, they will send you a letter notifying you of the charges and the steps you need to take to receive your package. unfortunately, we can't control or determine the duties and taxes that will apply to your order. because policies vary, please contact your country's customs office for more information. when ordering from us, you are the importer of record and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods. additional shipping charges may apply when multi-volume sets, exceptionally large or heavy books, and/or ephemera are ordered, additional shipping charges may be assessed. if you are ordering such an item, we recommend contacting its seller beforehand to determine whether non-standard shipping charges will be applied to your order. back to top expedited shipping rush methods available one day air and two day air shipping are available only for items listed as shipping from alibris. to ship an order via one day air or two day air, place in your cart only items that are listed as shipping from alibris. on the checkout page, you will be able to select either one day air or two day air. (see the tables above for other shipping methods.) items listed by independent sellers cannot be shipped by one day air or two day air; please read our rush shipping precaution in the next section. how fast is rush delivery? rush orders normally ship the next business day after the order is placed. however, while it's definitely not the norm, some rush items can take longer than expected to be delivered. please be aware that items shipped one day air and two day air sometimes require up to two days of processing time before they can ship. rush orders can also only ship and be delivered on non-holiday weekdays within the contiguous united states. and the availability of an item (as described in its listing) is also a factor; some items aren't available for several days. again, complications aren't common, but please bear these details in mind when selecting a rush shipping method. back to top quick help forgot password? shipping rates money-back guarantee returns policy 100% secure shopping help center contact us about us the alibris story we're hiring! social responsibility why shop here? glossary join affiliates your account log in create an account order status book fetch wishlist sign up for coupons explore used books rare, out-of-print, & collectible books textbooks rent textbooks top video games used dvds & movies used cds & music find a bookseller browse subjects browse authors eligible for free shipping new authors & newly released books books you thought you'd never findsell books, music, & movies onlinerecommendations powered by simularity alibris for librariesinternational: alibris u.k. terms of use copyright © 1998 - 2013 alibris. all rights reserved. alibris and bookmate are trademarks of alibris alibris privacy policy please enter a valid email address in the format name@domain.extension get $300 in coupons and other goodies. enter your e-mail address sign up for newsletter no, thank you. you're signed up (and we ♥ you). watch for our welcome e-mail and your first coupon. thanks!
