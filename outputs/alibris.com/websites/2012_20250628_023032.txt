is a community cookbook that we published to benefit laurel elementary school in oakland, california—compiled by the school's children, the folks at alibris, and san francisco bay area celebrity chefs. the kids at laurel benefited for three years every time we sold one. this was such an amazing project that we received a community service award in 2000 from former president george h.w. bush’s organization, the points of light foundation. inevitably, we have books that are usable but have not sold. through an international program, dcwc nepal, we have donated some of these to children in nepal. we also donate many books to local organizations in sparks, nevada, where our distribution center is located. we also receive review copies of many books. we donate boxes and boxes of these books to local libraries each year, where they remain in circulation for years and are enjoyed by scores of children and adults. alibris cares about community we give back to our community, as a company and as individuals. projects to support the community include: a $1,000 donation and volunteering our time at the alameda county food bank to help sort, screen, and pack food. donating our time to the east bay regional shoreline cleanup to clean up a local beach. donating money to city slicker farms to help fund affordable fresh produce for the people of west oakland, california. participating in blood drives with the american red cross. annual holiday toy drives and food drives to benefit those most in need in our neighborhoods. as a company, we purchase our office supplies, including recycled printer paper, through give something back. they donate more than half of their after-tax profits to community-based organizations. at the holidays, employees choose two organizations to receive donations. past recipients include the following: glide memorial the san francisco court appointed special advocate program natural resources defense council world wildlife fund heifer international detroit rescue mission kiva alibris employees receive two community service days per year, so we can give back without taking time from our own personal responsibilities. alibris cares about our environment a big part of our business is devoted to recycling and re-use. every time someone buys a used book, cd, or dvd from the alibris marketplace and keeps it from ending up in a landfill, that’s a benefit to the environment. and we do much more—from using energy-efficient light bulbs in our corporate offices to supporting the bike-to-work movement by making it easy for our employees to get to work on two wheels instead of four. our red & green team is a volunteer employee committee that regularly meets to discuss “matters of the heart and the earth.” these meetings result in tangible recommendations that benefit our communities and our planet. we use compostable products at our company events and even compost our coffee grounds. we provide employees with vouchers for public transportation and van-pooling through the commuter check program. in promoting the use of public transportation, we’re doing our part to help improve air quality by reducing traffic congestion. commuter check is a pre-tax benefit so our employees also save on taxes. about us corporate alibris cares business services the alibris story policies employment contact alibris newsroom press releases media coverage alibris logos quick help forgot password?
