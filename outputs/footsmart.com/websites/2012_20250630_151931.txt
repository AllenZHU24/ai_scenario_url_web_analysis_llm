problem in the united states, and foot complications associated with diabetes lead to over 80,000 amputations each year. footsmart's mission is to be the best source for foot and lower body health products for baby boomers and seniors, so partnering with the american diabetes association is a natural fit. diabetes affects about 12% of our customers, greatly impacting them and their families, and we want to do our part to battle this disease. footsmart is a proud sponsor of the american diabetes association's step out: fight to stop diabetes program, and has teams participating in the two walks in the atlanta area in 2011. in 2010, footsmart contributed over $150,000 to the american diabetes association through customer donations and its own corporate contributions. footsmart partnered with 11alive, the atlanta, georgia nbc affiliate, to promote the atlanta step out program in an integrated tv and on-line media effort. learn more about the american diabetes association learn more about the "step out: walk to fight diabetes" program footsmart funds the podiatry institute children's medical mission program the podiatry institute, a non-profit, educational foundation committed to improving quality of life for individuals with foot, ankle and leg disorders, organizes groups of volunteer doctors and assistants to diagnose and provide free treatment for lower body health problems of children living in underdeveloped parts of the world. since the first footsmart-sponsored mission to guatemala in november 1999, there have been over a dozen mission trips to vietnam, nepal, venezuela, nicaragua, and el salvador. on the most recent trip to el salvador, doctors evaluated 116 children. eighty patients were fitted with orthotics, and 33 children had surgery for conditions such as idiopathic clubfoot, residual and revisional clubfoot, verticle talus, and tarsal coalition. while the working conditions weren't as good as in the u.s., the team made the best of every situation, and ultimately changed many young lives for the better. learn more about the podiatry institute learn more about the medical mission program footsmart donated over 13,000 pairs of shoes to the metropolitan interfaith association in 2010 mifa works to unite the diverse community in memphis, tennessee to address the challenges of poverty. since its founding in 1968, the organization has engaged the community to sustain the independence of seniors, transform the lives of families in crisis, and equip teens for success. footwear donated by footsmart is given to those in need who come to mifa for assistance. each year, approximately 2,300 seniors receive hot lunches five days a week, 25,000 adults and children visit emergency services for temporary help during a crisis, and 450 individuals live in mifa housing and take part in life skills programs. learn more about mifa programs benchmark brands, inc. invests in the leaders of tomorrow through the georgia executive women's
