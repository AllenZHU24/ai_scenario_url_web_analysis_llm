by new balanceginny ankle boots 5 of 5 view product 100% of customers would recommend this to a friend (1 out of 1) finally found new boots! - sheryljkt, new hampshire posted: october 11, 2014 if you like dansko or bikenstock for their arch support, you will love these boots. i don't have to use my orthopedics, because the arch support is exactly what i need. this of course helps me with the width, i bought a wide, as i have a wide foot. these boots work well and are quite comfortable. they are all leather and well made. i am happy to find this brand. easy spirit traveltime 83 clogs 5 of 5 view product 100% of customers would recommend this to a friend (2 out of 2) love these shoes. - historyprof, central vermont posted: october 11, 2014 they're stretchy enough to accommodate a variety of foot problems, and have cushy support and great looks. i have small, wide feet with a high instep and a bunion, but these (in wide) are very comfortable. the red is very spiffy looking. toe warmers magic boots 4.4 of 5 view product 86% of customers would recommend this to a friend (18 out of 21) great pair of boots. posted: october 21, 2014 this was my first pair of toe warmers boots. i always wear a size 8m in shoes and boots; however, based on other reviews, i ordered a size 8w in black. glad i did. they are the perfect size with heavy wool socks, and in my opinion, well made. i suggest ordering a half size up and a wider width. you will be pleased with these boots. sign up for exclusive offers sign up to receive emails about new products and offers connect with us payment
