your credit card information from a secure webpage to a secure application on our server. once on our server, your credit card number is saved only long enough for us to process and approve the transaction unless you have chosen to establish an account. during the final stages of ordering online, you will see an unbroken key or locked padlock at the bottom of your browser window and https:// in the location window at the top of your browser. both of these indicate that the page you are on is secured using ssl encryption to communicate with our secure web server. because ssl encryption

process and indicate that you prefer to order online with a credit card. nonetheless, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, as there are limitations of the internet that are beyond our control. thus, while we use commercially reasonable security measures to protect data, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security, integrity, and
