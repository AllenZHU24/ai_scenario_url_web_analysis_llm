"lifetime" is defined as (1) the time until an event occurs (transient voltage surge or spike) that causes damage to the surge protector and the connected equipment, (2) the date that the component providing the surge protection exceeds its capacity and ceases to provide protection for surges and spikes, or (3) the reasonable lifespan of the surge protector, whichever is sooner. the reasonable lifespan of the surge protector is five (5) years from the date of your purchase of the product, which timeframe was determined by anker after taking into account that products will become worn and obsolete and that material and parts will wear down or may become unusable due to advances in technology. anker offers a limited connected equipment warranty (“cew”) for anker surge protector as listed below. anker will repair or replace, at its discretion, any defective surge protector free of charge. anker will reimburse you for the fair market value, as determined by anker, or repair the damaged connected equipment (at anker’s option), up to the dollar limits listed below, provided that all of the conditions stated below are fully met. the cew covers damages caused by voltage spikes and surges (“occurrence”), which enter the connected equipment while properly connected through an anker surge protector to a properly wired ac power line with a protective ground. it does not cover damage from continuous over-voltage such as occurs when the power company crosses lines, open neutrals, or direct lighting strikes. after an occurrence, the surge protector will then have performed its duty, and a new surge protector must be purchased.this is a limited warranty subject to the limitations and exclusions set forth herein. anker reserves the right to update, amend, and/or revise the terms of this cew.qualifying conditions for connected equipment coverage:the cew is valid only for the original purchaser of the anker surge protector.the connected equipment must be underwriter laboratories (ul) listed.the connected equipment must be properly connected through an anker surge protector to a properly wired and grounded electrical outlet.the connected equipment must be an ac connected device. the anker surge protector must be directly and properly plugged into a grounded electrical outlet without any extension cords or adapters. the installation of the electrical outlet must be installed in compliance with all applicable electrical and safety regulations, including but not limited to the national electrical code (“nec”) and/or canadian electrical (ce) code and any

connected equipment warranty:damage to electronic equipment resulting from a transient voltage surge on unprotected wires or lines.restoration of lost data and/or reinstallation of software.damage caused by acts of god, war, vandalism, theft, normal use wear-and-tear, depletion, obsolescence, abnormal care or uses, abuse, or negligence.damage caused by modification or alteration to the anker surge protector or the connected equipment.damage caused by accidents, fires or natural disasters such as flood, erosion, earthquake, wind, or direct lightning.damage caused by lack of grounding.damage caused by low-voltage disturbance (i.e., brownouts or sags).the repair or replacement of the damaged equipment is covered under a manufacturer’s warranty or seller’s extended warranty.anker determines that the connected equipment was not used under normal operating conditions or in accordance with any manufacturer’s instructions for the connected device.anker shall in no way be liable for any damages not specifically included in this cew, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or multiple damages arising from the use of anker surge
