sets of electric guitar strings are listed by manufacturer in the sections below. individual electric guitar strings can be found in the single strings section. electric guitar strings come in a variety of gauges and methods of constructions.  the most popular are nickel plated steel roundwounds, such as ernie ball slinkys, d’addario xls, and ghs boomers.  nickel plated steel electric guitar strings provide a bright clear tone.  some people prefer the tone of pure nickel electric guitar strings, which give a warmer, more vintage sounding tone than nickel plated steel strings.  other players like stainless steel electric guitar strings because they are brighter than nickel plated steel or pure nickel. jazz players often prefer flatwound electric guitar strings because they give the warmest, smoothest tone. just strings offers the best electric guitar strings in the business. another thing to keep in mind is the scale length of your guitar.  fender stratocasters, which are 25 ˝ inch scale, come from the factory set up with extra light strings (.009 - .042).  many players prefer this set up because the .009 gauge strings are still easy to bend despite fenders having a longer scale length.  gibson les pauls, on the other hand, are 24 ľ inch scale, and come from the factory set up with light gauge strings (.010 - .046).  many players prefer this set up because the .009 gauge can be a bit too easy to bend on the shorter scale length.  using .010 gauge strings makes the guitar a bit more balanced.  of course, you can use whatever gauge of electric guitar strings you like.  players with a heavy hand may find that a medium gauge (.011 - .048) electric guitar string will break less and stay in tune better than a lighter string. the electric guitar was invented sometime in the 1930s in an effort to achieve more volume than a purely acoustic instrument was capable of producing.  some of the first companies to make modern electric guitars and electric guitar strings were rickenbacker, with their electro-spanish guitar, national with their own electric spanish style guitar and gibson with the es-150 jazz guitar.  although these guitars and the gibson es-150 in particular, outwardly resembled other popular acoustic guitars of the time, these new guitars were unlike traditional acoustic guitars in that they were not designed to produce very much sound when not amplified.  with the aid of an amplifier however; they were able to produce volumes loud enough to play in the large jazz bands of the era. in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, the instruments we think of today as electric guitars were invented.  these were: the fender telecaster in 1948, the gibson les paul in 1952 and the fender stratocaster in 1954. these three new solid body guitars, the telecaster, the les paul and the stratocaster are without a doubt still the most recognizable and popular solid body electric guitars in the world.  all are still made today in more or less the same form they in which they were available in the 1950’s.  these guitars are the sound of country and rock and roll, and their electric guitar strings are an integral part of that sound.  without them, it is hard to imagine what the musical landscape of the last 60 years would have looked like. along with the development of the solid body electric was that of the hollow and semi-hollow body electric guitar.  hollow body jazz guitars were produced in the 1930s; a notable example of one of these is the gibson es-150.  these instruments performed well until the volume on their amplifiers was turned up very high, at which point they produced large amounts of unwanted feedback.  to combat this feedback, the semi-hollow body electric guitar was invented.  these looked much like their hollow body counterparts, but had a solid piece of wood running from the neck joint to under the bridge of the guitar.  this had numerous advantages.  first, the guitar’s wood did not vibrate nearly as much as on an acoustic style instrument.  this helped eliminate unwanted feedback, because the pickups were limited to picking up the vibration of the electric guitar strings rather than that of the strings and body.  the solid piece of the body also provided a solid place to mount the bridge of the guitar, which helped intonation and tuning stability. notable examples of semi hollow body guitars are the gibson es-335, the gretsch duo-jet and the rickenbacker 360. just strings carries some of the best electric guitar strings for your instrument. quick links acoustic guitar
