sets of classical guitar strings are listed by manufacturer in the sections below. individual classical guitar strings can be found in the single strings section. classical guitar strings were made of gut until the mid 20th century when nylon guitar strings were introduced. nylon strings have numerous advantages over their gut predecessors. nylon is more resilient and tends to hold its tune better, and it is also much more resistant to changes in climate conditions like temperature and humidity. classical nylon guitar strings typically have wound e, a & d strings and plain nylon g, b & e strings.nylon strings are available in several varieties.  perhaps the most common type of treble string is clear nylon. clear nylon guitar strings are made out of durable nylon mono-filament in various gauges depending on the note the string is designed for. clear nylon strings are popular because of the clarity and richness of their sound. there are also rectified nylon treble strings which start out as clear nylon strings and are then precision ground to a uniform diameter along their entire length.  rectified strings sound mellower than their clear counterparts.  some companies make black nylon treble strings which sound more pure and have more treble overtones than clear or rectified nylon strings.  classical guitar bass strings are metal wound over multi-filament nylon cores.  some are called “gold”, but are in fact bronze wound and are popular because of the richness and fullness of their sound. others are referred to as “silver”, which are typically silver plated copper wire wound, and have a much more brilliant tone than “gold” wound strings.normal classical guitar strings are straight at both ends; these are called tie-end classical guitar strings. they are designed for classical bridges and must be tied on. they will not work on an acoustic guitar with bridge pins. if a set does not specify whether it is tie-end or ball end, it is safe to assume the set is of tie-end strings.  there are ball end classical strings available.  these are often used by folk guitarists. these strings will work on regular acoustic guitars as well as specially made folk guitars. these are clearly described as ball end in the catalogue.  the easiest way to find these is to click the search tool on the upper left side of this page, and type “nylon ball end”. you will then see a list of sets matching that description.  keep in mind that if they do not specifically state that they have ball ends, they are tie-end strings. quick links acoustic guitar strings adamas
