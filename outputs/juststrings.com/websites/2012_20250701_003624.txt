stringsbass guitar strings acoustic bass guitar strings electric bass guitar strings flatwound bass guitar strings electric acoustic bass guitar strings steinberger double ball bass guitar strings it is very important for you to know what scale length your bass is before you buy bass strings. most basses are long scale, which is 34 inches from bridge to nut. if a set’s description does not specify scale length, it is almost always long scale, which is the standard size for an electric bass. short scale is 30 inches, medium scale is 32 inches and extra long scale is 36 inches. to find the scale length of your bass, measure from the saddles on the bridge to the nut at the top of the fingerboard. it may not be exactly short (30”), medium (32”), long (34”) or extra long (36”), but you should choose sets of the scale length that most closely matches your instrument. some basses that are strung through the body rather than just through the bridge may require longer bass guitar strings. if you are not sure, or are uncomfortable measuring your bass yourself, please contact the manufacturer of your instrument. they will happily tell you what scale length your bass is and what length bass strings you will need. we have the right bass strings for you and your bass.the electric bass is essentially a very long scale electric guitar with only four strings. bass strings are usually tuned e, a, d and g, one octave below the strings on a guitar. electric bass string sets are available with four, five and six strings, with less common versions having seven, eight or twelve. five string bass strings are usually tuned b, e, a, d and g, but some people tune them e, a, d, g and c. special sets are required for the high c tuning. six string bass strings are tuned b, e, a, d, g and c.other variations of the bass guitar, such as the acoustic bass and acoustic-electric bass are essentially acoustic versions of the electric bass guitar, which was invented first. they, like their electric counterparts, are essentially very long scale acoustic guitars with four strings. the acoustic-electric versions are like acoustic electric guitars that have either a transducer system or piezo pickups in them to pickup the sound and transmit it to a bass amplifier.electric bass guitar strings are available in several different materials and construction methods. the most common is stainless steel roundwound. this provides a bright, powerful tone that many people prefer. if you are looking for a warmer sound, you might try nickel plated roundwound strings instead. nickel plated steel will provide a warmer, rounder sound than stainless steel. nickel plated steel strings are also less harsh on fingers and frets. for an even warmer tone, pure nickel roundwound strings can be used.many bassists prefer the feel of flatwound strings to that of roundwounds. flatwounds are usually made of stainless steel, but some companies make nickel versions. flatwound bass strings provide a very deep, bassy tone, suitable for classic jazz and r&b. examples of such tone can be heard on most motown recordings. flatwound strings are also substantially easier on fingers and frets than roundwounds. many players prefer flatwound strings on their fretless basses to cut down on premature fingerboard wear.acoustic basses typically use phosphor bronze wound strings, which are available in the acoustic bass guitar or electric acoustic bass guitar sections above. some players like the feel and sound of other types of strings including stainless steel, nickel, black nylon tapewound and stainless flatwound. all of those strings are available in the electric bass guitar section.steinberger double ball bass strings are designed to only fit steinberger basses and licensed copies. quick
