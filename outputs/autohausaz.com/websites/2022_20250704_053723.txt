milton keynes, uk comes the tier-1 partner to volkswagen group, racingline. since 2001, racingline has been running the vw motorsport programme. the first kit car, a golf 3 2.0l 16v generated 285hp in 1996. over the past 2 decades, they have cultivated their relationships with the oems and vw group to allow them to fabricate their own branded line of performance parts. the parts were inspired to increase overall performance in ride control, speed, and braking. with hundreds of authorized dealers worldwide, we are incredibly privileged to stand by a brand that is so widely recognized and respected in it’s marketplace. racingline air intake systems racingline air induction and filters are one of the most popular performance enhancements for vw and audi owners for the money. many of their intake systems incorporate their trifoam filter, or carbon fiber piping. these systems, whether open intake or closed, generate tremendous power gains by allowing the cooler dense air into the fuel metering unit. some of these filters are up to 40% larger than the factory unit. racingline’s cold air intake systems are widely considered the most sophisticated available in the market. racingline oil catch cans airflow is the most essential component to capturing maximum performance and horsepower gains. oil catch cans are the middle man between your turbo charged vw’s lubrication and ventilation systems. racingline’s oil catch cans are equipped with a built-in baffle plate preventing unwanted oil and water vapors from entering the pcv system. the 210 series braided hose lines are reinforced by a stainless steel inner weave to provide the utmost durability. all components are precision machined and most fittings are hand polished. why not have the engine bay reflect the quality and precision engineering of each facet of your racingline oil management system? racingline turbo inlet hoses racingline’s turbo inlet hoses, or elbows, unleash tremendous hp gains by eliminating restrictive thick plastic walls. in order to maximize the elbow’s circumference, these high flow units utilize a thinner wall and more intuitive hose bend. the material is comprised delicately machined cnc aluminum and gloss-anodized for a showroom finish. compared to other costly turbo upgrades, racingline turbo inlet hoses offer an essential upgrade without hitting the pocketbook. the latest and greatest sign up for sales, coupons, special offers and product information from autohausaz. sign up quick links how to use our site shipping and freight policy how to place
