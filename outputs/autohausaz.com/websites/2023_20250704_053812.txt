to give the enthusiast market the upgraded parts and technology to get the most from their vehicles. all 034motorsport products are designed, engineered and manufactured to the highest quality standards right here in the usa. all are built to exceed the factory standard parts they replace or enhance. check out the autohausaz online catalog to see what 034motorsport options are available for your specific vehicle. 034motorsports engine mounts the 034motorsport line of engine mounts are engineered to greatly reduce drivetrain slop and decrease engine movement under load. their line of street density engine mounts are manufactured with 50 durometer rubber that are void-free and solid filled resulting in approximately 25% stiffer mounts than stock. changing out your audi/vw factory stock mounts for a pair of 034motorsport engine mounts with give you improved power transfer, improved shifting feel and make your spirited driving a lot more enjoyable. so get the most out of your audi/vw vehicle by upgrading your engine mounts to the latest 034motorsport engine mounts. 034motorsports suspension control arm kits when you want to drive your audi/vw with a bit more enthusiasm than just cruising, you are going to want to know that your suspension can handle it safely. the 034motorsport suspension control arm kit will give that reassurance with track-proven sport suspension upgrades to stock. when vag redesigned the front suspension decades ago to go with a multi-link type control arm arrangement it greatly improved the feel and performance of your car. but over time those factory control arm bushings and joints wear and lose that tight feel. installing a complete 034motorsport suspension control arm kit will not only bring back that feel but with their stiffer higher durometer rubber improve your suspension to better than factory. the 034motorsport kits will also give you an even longer lifecycle due to their sturdier design and quality. 034motorsports crankcase breather hose kits all modern cars have a crankcase ventilation system to remove unwanted gases from the crankcase in a controlled manner. what started out as a simple pcv valve in the valve cover years ago has now become a series of hoses and valves to precisely do that function. most of this system is manufactured with rubber hoses and plastic fittings that over time get brittle and can leak that air causing the engine to run rougher than usual. replacing the worn out factory setup with an 034motorsport crankcase breather hose kit will greatly improve system performance and will last even longer than stock. using reinforced silicone hoses designed specifically for your particular engine configuration each kit comes with all the parts required to replace and upgrade your factory system. once installed you can be assured of many more years of service. the latest and greatest sign up for sales, coupons, special offers and product information from autohausaz. sign up quick links
