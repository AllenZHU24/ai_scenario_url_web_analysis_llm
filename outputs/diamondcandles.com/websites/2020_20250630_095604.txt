we use a combination of essential and synthetic fragrance oils to create our exclusive scents. as much as possible, we try to use essential oils to make the majority of our fragrances. in fact, all of our scents include essential fragrance oils, but to create a scent like carnival candy for example, we need to include some synthetic ingredients to create a scent reminiscent of the state fair. all of of our fragrances are paraben and phthalate free. if you have a known allergy to a specific ingredient, such as cinnamon, that is triggered by skin contact or inhalation, burning a cinnamon tea candle might irritate your allergies. please read the fragrance notes in the description for each candle to determine if it contains any items that you know bother your allergies. our ring candles are made with natural soy wax and an exclusive blend of fragrances. our production facility in roxboro, nc does not use nuts or products made from them. our candles do not contain nuts or ingredients that are made with them. candle burning and care tips properly burning your candle is essential.  we design these candles with safety in mind and put a warning as well as instructions on the base of every diamond candle. here are a few tips to ensure the safety of your family and home: never leave a candle unattended.  this is not specific to diamond candles candles.  your home and your family is number one.  if you leave, be sure you put your candles out first! do not leave your candle within reach of pets or children.  with scented candles pets can become curious and want to eat it, if they get close they may knock over the candle which is not only a disaster for your upholstery but has the potential of catching anything it falls into on fire. along the same lines, children are curious and for their safety and your own please keep it out of their reach. do not burn your candle next to or on something that can easily catch fire.  do not place your candle on a cardboard box, do not burn your candle with paper leaning on the side, so not burn your candle next to the wall or near drapes/curtains.  it is best to burn your candle on a flat surface that has at least several inches between your candle and any other item. do not burn a candle that has been cracked or broken. keep the candle free of any debris.  this means keep those used matches and wick trimming out of the candle.  they can catch on fire and cause an unsafe burn. never burn a candle for longer than 4 hours.  after 4 hours you should extinguish the flame and allow the wax to settle before trimming the wick and re-lighting.  if you burn a candle for longer than 4 hours the wick will continue getting longer and burn with an unsafe flame length that could cause blackening on the jar and overheating issues. always burn your candle on a candle holder or plate.  candle jars can get hot. a hot jar on a counter or surface can leave a mark.  be sure to have something between your candle and the counter it is sitting on. do not pick up a jar after a recent burn.  you should allow it to cool for a few minutes before moving it as the jar may be hot. do not burn a candle lower than 1/4 inch from the bottom. these are just a few safety tips that help maintain a safe environment for your candle burning needs. remember these other useful tips for caring for your candle: – you should burn your candle for a minimum of one hour each burn.  constant “short burns” could cause tunneling. – you should keep your wick trimmed to about 1/4 inch above the wax level.  trim after each use. – you should not extinguish the flame with the lid or water. – you should stop use when the wax level reaches about 1/4 inch. burning that last bit of wax is not safe, there is nothing to contain the heat and the jar will get very hot very fast. any issues? report within 60 days of purchase date. we at diamond candles stand behind our product.  if any issue should arise with your candle you must contact us within 60 days of the date of purchase to report said issue. “issue” is a generalization of any problem (ordering, burning, shipping, scent, etc) if you do not contact us within 60 days we may not be able to assist you. credit card companies and paypal will not allow any refunds beyond 60 days from date of purchase. shipping charges are non-refundable. my candle wick won't seem to light, what should i do? if the wax level seems like it is too high, you can use a hair dryer to melt the top of the wax and then drain the wax until it is slightly below the wick. if that doesn’t seem to be the problem, sometimes the wax may build up on the wick and you might just have to hold the lighter on the wick a little longer. if you have any further problems do not hesitate to contact customer service and you will be taken care of. my candle was broke when it was delivered, what do i do? oh no!!!  we don’t like to hear about a candle being broken upon delivery.  if you have received a broken candle we require photos of it and may ask for pictures of the packaging and /or the box it was shipped in. we cannot help you if we cannot get pictures of the broken candle.  we advise you to not throw anything away until you have a new order in route or until a refund is processed. once you take a few pictures email them to help@diamondcandles.com with a brief message letting us know the scent and any additional details you feel are relevant.  we will reply back with additional instructions. please note: candles that have been lit will not be replaced. rings can i choose what size ring i get in my candle? we place rings of the most common ring sizes inside each ring candle. most often the rings are sizes 6-8, but there is a possibility you may get a larger or smaller ring than 6-8. we do not have the option to specify what size ring you want inside your candle at this time. if someone has a ring inside their candle that is either too big or too small then they most often will give out away to a friend or family member. please note: there are ring swap pages on facebook you can check if you wish to change it for a smaller or larger size! if your ringreveal™ is worth $100, $1000, or $5000, you will be able to select your style and size (whole sizes only) from our exclusive ring boutique. wax ended up on my ring, what do i do? have no fear! sometimes when you reveal your ring some wax may get on it.  if this happens there are a couple ways that we have found, as well as other customers, to prove useful in removing the wax from the ring. 1) you can boil some water, pour it in a cup and swirl the ring around in the cup using tweezers or a spoon.  2) you can use an old toothbrush and some toothpaste.  just brush it around on the ring and then rinse it clean.  this is also a neat way to polish up that old looking jewelry. there are many ways to remove the wax, these are just the top two that we find most useful!  if you have another suggestion that has worked for you feel free to let us know 🙂 where is my ring? our ring candles have a small gold circle stuck to the inside of the jar buried in the candle.  this gold marker is where your ring is! please be patient and allow your candle to burn evenly and safely down to where your ring is.  if you dig for your ring you may end up damaging it as well as causing your candle to burn unevenly or tunnel. luxe ring candles will not have a gold dot.  the ring will be found in the middle of the candle rather than on the side. please avoid digging, patience is a virtue. =) can't find a ring in my candle? there is a ring in every single ring candle that we pour. if you have burned your candle down to the level where the ring should be (denoted by the gold marker on the side of every ring diamond candle) and it is not there that simply means that it has fallen to the bottom of the candle. you will have to work a little harder and be patient this time around to find your ring. we discourage digging for the ring as you may damage it. how can you put rings in every diamond candle ring candle? is diamond candles a scam? how can we afford to put nice rings inside every diamond candles ring candle? we are most definitely a legitimate company and are here to stay. think about it like this, have you ever seen ads for a detergent company on television? ad space during ‘prime time’ at night is extremely expensive. where do they get that money from to do that?  the money they make when they sell their products is reinvested back into the company by getting more customers and selling more products. instead of us spending money on tv commercials, we take part of the money that we make from each candle sale and put a ring inside every full sized ring candle. obviously we can’t put a $1,000 ring in each ring candle, but because we buy so many rings, we get discounts just like a jewelry store would. need to see it to believe it?  head on over to our facebook page and just ask our fans and see the pictures they have uploaded of the rings they have found.. payment how do i change my order? an order can be changed, however, there is a very small amount of time that this can be done.  you see, once an order is submitted and the billing is processed the order is sent to one of our three warehouses for packaging and shipping. to change an order you will need to contact our customer support team by clicking the link at the top of this page.  to help speed things along write in from the email address that made the order.  in your help your request be sure to include your order number. we can change or update the following: – the shipping address – candle scents by, swapping, adding, or removing – add a coupon code if it was forgotten we are not able to change or update the billing information. paypal processed orders will be limited to same priced candle swaps. how do i cancel an order?
