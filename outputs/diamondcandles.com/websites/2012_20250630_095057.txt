earth friendly natural soy candles | diamond candles | diamond candles earth friendly natural soy candles | diamond candles menu you may find yourself wondering what exactly makes diamond candles more "earth friendly" than other candles. in fact you may be wondering what can make a candle bad for planet earth at all. the key difference, as with many "earth friendly" products, lies in the ingredients we use. while most companies are being caught with their hand in the cookie jar when it comes to using only the lowest quality ingredients at the sake of their community and the people living in it, we work with only the best ingredients and materials to bring you a true no compromise product. we work to bring you the highest quality, longest lasting, strongest smelling candles made with the most environmentally responsible and quality ingredients and materials. most candles are made from what is called paraffin wax. what most people don't know is that paraffin wax is actually a byproduct of crude oil. so every paraffin wax candle you buy supports oil companies. our wicks are also made from cotton, even some so called 'natural' candle companies use paraffin wax to coat the wicks in their candles! there is no lead, tin, or zinc in our wicks either. diamond candles are made using soy wax, which is different from the paraffin wax used by most candle makers. soy wax is natural and made from soy bean plants. our wicks are coated in soy wax instead of paraffin, because we don't want to make any compromises. we love knowing that our candles come straight from the earth. when they are burned the ingredients evaporate into the air, and eventually those molecules make their way back into the ground again through rain water. it is a complete cycle! our soy wax is also made from only us soy beans. we do our best to support american farmers and the american economy by using local products. with a strong soy bean crop here in central north carolina, we are located and manufacture all of our candles here in durham, nc. we are extremely aware of how our local agriculture and farming community can be affected by changes in the worldwide economy at a moments notice. by supporting us you are supporting the local and domestic farmers that we source our soy wax from. diamond candles wants to provide a great product to our customers while still being as kind as we can to the planet. so we strive every day to make our candles as healthy for the planet and for you as possible. we believe that with a focus on a quality product that functions better than any other alternatives out there, has unique and fun fragrances, has a strong scent 'throw' (scent that fills a room), is long lasting, and is created with only the best materials that are sourced responsibly we can make the most enjoyable candle for your home. you can feel proud to support and consume these candles for your daily pleasure! join us and over 50,000 other people just like you and vote with your wallet. vote for your children and grandchildren by supporting renewable sourced, fun, and quality candles from us, diamond candles. make the pledge to only buy soy today! home store search cart account menu home shop tour help blog suggest new scents facebook
