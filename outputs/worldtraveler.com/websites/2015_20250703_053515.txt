breach, the tsa requires flyers adhere to the 3-1-1 liquid rule when planning to board flights with liquids when crossing security checkpoints. the tsa’s 3-1-1 liquid rule applies to carrying on all liquids barring special circumstances.* in order to properly stow liquids, and not be pulled aside for further examination, follow these guidelines for proper liquid carry-on procedure. carry-on liquids (flights starting in the u.s.) : the tsa’s liquid carry-on rule refers to the principle that you can only carry containers of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less in one quart-sized clear plastic container. this is a per passenger rule, which prohibits from carrying liquids along with yours for other travelers in your party. international carry-on liquids (flights entering the u.s. from abroad) : when traveling into the u.s. with a connecting flight you are allowed to carry over the 100 ml amount within certain bounds. you will be able to pass through security with liquids bought in a clear bag at a duty-free shop -this means any retailer that is selling to travelers with the understanding they will be leaving the country with those goods- such as airport retailers. as a final measure, make sure the package your liquids are contained in has not been tampered with to secure safe passage through security with your liquid items. *if you declare medications, baby formula, baby food, or breast milk, these items will be permitted in greater quantities than the 100 ml that the tsa usually permits. simply tell your tsa officer before the screening and you will not be flagged for your liquids. last updated: september 9th 2014 3-1-1 liquids rule luggageluggagecarry-on luggagehardside luggagelightweight luggageleather luggagewheeled luggagekids' luggagegarment bagsluggage by
