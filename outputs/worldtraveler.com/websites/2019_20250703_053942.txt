protection to your belongings but also looks great even after many journeys. to achieve this balance, tumi employs a variety of materials within the manufacture of their cases and bags to ensure durability and aesthetic appeal. some of tumi's most commonly used materials include: ballistic nylon - most commonly used in soft-sided luggage but still offers excellent protection for your belongings. additionally, ballistic nylon is easily cleaned and does not show scratches thanks to its textured weave. polycarbonate - used within hard-sided luggage for the ultimate in protective casing. polycarbonate luggage from tumi boasts some truly notable finishes and stylish designs, however, scratches can be difficult to repair and may compromise the aesthetic appeal of your case. tegris - as a material unique to tumi cases, tegris is something of a revelation. similar to polycarbonate in its strength and ballistic nylon in its weave, tegris offers the best of both worlds and is found in some of tumi's most celebrated luggage. leather - used in tumi's most desirable cases and bags, leather is—and always will make—for a beautiful piece of luggage. when cared for correctly, tumi leather bags and cases will last you many years, however, it doesn't offer the same kind of protection as ballistic nylon or polycarbonate. back totop how much is tumi luggage? tumi prices its
