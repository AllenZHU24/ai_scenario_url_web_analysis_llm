buyers' guides high-quality luggage benefits no, thank you [x] success! please insert a valid email address. submit close [x] high-quality luggage benefits it's easy for passengers recovering from luggage sticker shock to forget that baggage is designed to protect valuable belongings during travel on top of being fashionable. a more expensive, high-quality, name-brand set of luggage will last much longer and endure the inevitable impact of travel and automated luggage handling while keeping personal items safe and intact. off-brand inexpensive luggage often comes with problems regarding quality. here are just a few things that you will notice either before or upon purchase with these items: substandard zippers poorly designed wheels cheap latches materials that tear or show scratches immediately handlebars that break or become unstable savvy travelers should search for bags with high-quality inline wheels, smooth, sturdy zippers, high density ballistic nylons and canvases that come in higher leveled material. in addition, a major benefit to carrying quality luggage is the warranty that comes along with buying a quality brand. name-brand luggage sets, travel products, and leather goods from recognized companies such as briggs & riley, tumi luggage, and victorinox luggage offer travelers warranties of one year or more on most products, and have authorized service centers in many u.s. regions. this makes it feasible to have your luggage seeing you through many years down the line. name brands will usually make collections in a range of different price points, giving travelers the opportunity to choose the level of investment they would like to make in a quality luggage piece. whether going with the most luxe bag in a line or not, you will find that name brands hold their luggage to a higher set of standards due to their warranty policies, reputability, and the quality materials and features they have found to make their lines stand out. high-quality
