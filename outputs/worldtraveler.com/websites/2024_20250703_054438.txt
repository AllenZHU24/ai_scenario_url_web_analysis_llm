international carry-on size restrictions can be a notoriously challenging subject to grasp since so much of the restrictions are determined by where you are traveling. however, international carry-on size rulings become easier to digest  once you can decipher the rules that depend upon international or domestic travel. here's a breakdown on just what to look for with your next trip. international carry-on size outside of the u.s. the standard carry-on baggage size is smaller (this relates to flights originating outside the u.s. and with a destination outside the u.s.) here, the rule of thumb is about 21", and not the 22" and above carry-on size. as with any rule, exceptions abound and it is a good idea to visit the site of all of the carriers you plan to use while abroad to get a consensus. if you travel outside the u.s. on a regular basis or are looking to purchase a bag for someone who does, you might want to consider replacing the standard domestic sized carry-on bag in your set with an international carry-on sized bag. in terms of what the two bags will actually hold the difference is not that great and it may add some flexibility in your travels. carry-on size &

international luggage size international luggage size standards are mostly weight based. 50 pounds is the usual weight limit. the largest checked international luggage size allowed is 62 linear (total) inches. typically, a standard checked luggage size wavers around 27 x 21 x 14 inches. domestic carry-on luggage size the universally accepted carry-on luggage size for a domestic flights (within the u.s.) is 22" x 14" x 9". that being said, anyone who has frequented short haul commuter flights will tell you that this size bag often will not fit into the overhead compartment and thus ends up being checked at the gate anyway. we have not heard at this time that anyone has been charged for a checked bag as a result of this, but then things are changing daily in the airline industry. make a point to check out your airline's web site in advance to find out the latest regulations on the carry-on luggage size for domestic flights. what qualifies domestic flights? flights originating in the u.s. with foreign destinations and flights originating outside the u.s. with a u.s. destination generally use the u.s. standard for carry-on baggage size. carry-on luggage packing restrictions when it comes to carry-on luggage packing restrictions, the transportation security administration (tsa) requires the same things of international carry-on and domestic carry-on travelers. the 3-1-1 rule dictates that travelers can only carry on toiletries in bottles that hold three ounces or less. bottles must all be packed into one quart-sized zip-top bag, and each passenger is permitted only one bag, with a few exceptions. after being implemented during the wake of a liquid explosive bomb plot in the united kingdom, the 3-1-1 regulation is now widely accepted by many international airport security systems. international travelers returning to the united states should check with u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) to determine whether they are restricted from carrying on snack items like fruits, vegetables and canned or dried meats. every fruit or vegetable must be declared to a cbp officer, regardless of how safe or pest-free it may look. bakery items, chocolate and cured cheeses are generally allowed, but may be examined by cbp officials. name email * phone number message quick links search international carry-on size contact us a brief history gift card repairs
