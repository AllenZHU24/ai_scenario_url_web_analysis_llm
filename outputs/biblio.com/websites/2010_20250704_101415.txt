investing in the classics. just like blue chip stocks, buying an established work or author can be a safe way to preserve your initial investment, even if you don’t realize huge profit margins. the value of a work of incunabula isn’t likely to plummet anytime soon. the basics no matter what you collect, a few basics apply. supply and demand: the value of a book is directly correlated to the market demand. every book has a first edition, but the value of the first edition as a collectible is a matter of the number of copies available and the number of people looking for them. condition, condition, condition. the value of a collectible book is based on the condition of a book. the most desirable copy of any book is a perfect copy. each flaw takes away from a book’s value. when buying a collectible book, make sure and read the description carefully, and pay attention to the condition of the book and the dust jacket. jackets required for the most part, any book of fiction, and the majority of non-fiction published since around world war i was sold with a dust jacket. the dust jacket of a collectible book can be the most valuable part of the book, since it is the most fragile. a dust jacket on a rare collectible book can be 80% of the book’s value. the earlier the better. in general, the earliest works by an author are the most valuable. this is due to a couple of reasons: very early works by an author tend to not sell as many copies. readers don’t know the author’s works yet, so they tend to not run out and buy their books as soon as they are published. since publishers know that tendency in readers, they often won’t print as many copies of the first edition, making the supply of first editions scarcer. in part, the goal of collecting first editions is to go back to the source. if the first edition of the book is the closest to the original version of that work, the author’s first published work is one step closer to the author. a signed manuscript is possibly the closest to the original source, and thus can bring the highest prices. a first edition means the first printing. the first edition of a book, for the purposes of collecting modern books, is the first printing of that book. the term “first thus” is used when describing a first printing of a later edition. have fun! the goal of book collecting is to express your love of books. there isn’t a right or wrong way to do that. this entry was written by stephen, posted on december 6, 2010 at 11:15 am, filed under book collecting and tagged book collecting, collecting books, home library, love of books, tips. bookmark the permalink. follow any comments here with the rss feed for this post. post a comment or leave a trackback: trackback url. « faq: promotional codes on biblio how much is my book worth? » post a comment your email is never shared. required fields are marked * name * email * website comment blog search our blog pages calendar of book collecting and literary events categories book blog network book care book repair book collecting book identification book terminology book value home library book reviews bookselling bookstores faqs about books for fun forum how-to interview news & announcements profiles authors illustrators sales saving money search tips textbooks top 10 lists uncategorized archives december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 august 2008 june 2008 march 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 september 2006 june 2006 january 2006 december 2005 september 2005 may 2005 blogroll book faerie: journey of a bookseller for the love of books ibooknet juxtabook – bookseller's blog peakirk books rss feeds all posts all comments advanced book search browse by subject browse by book list how to find used & out of print books discount books free shipping free coupons tips for saving money on books new books used & out-of-print books rare books how to be notified of new arrivals find rare books book value book forum learn about book collecting discount textbooks sell textbooks k-12 textbooks tips for saving on textbooks online find bookshops find specialists become a biblio.com bookseller why support independent bookstores? sign up to receive offers and updates: services your account 30-day return guarantee libraries & institutions help & faq contact us about why shop at biblio? our story biblio staff biblioworks social responsibility media & press books blog company blog resources discount textbooks link your site to biblio.com refer a friend for booksellers free bookseller software affiliate program book repair articles book glossary select country privacy & security terms & conditions site map copyright © 2000-2010 biblio, inc. all rights reserved.
