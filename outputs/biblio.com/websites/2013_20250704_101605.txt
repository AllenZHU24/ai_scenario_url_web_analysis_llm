most importantly - listening to these professionals. we listened to our customers, we adapted to their needs, and shaped our learning experience around them. and, slowly, we gained the trust and respect of a small but loyal base of customers and booksellers. i've always objected to the idea, as a customer, that i can be "acquired." yet, modern industry rings feverishly with the phrase, "customer acquisition." as a customer, i don't mind being helped, talked with, served, even sold to. but i won't be "acquired". the difference again is relationships. that's where we began our business, and how we grow our business, even now. while most of the other book marketplaces have closed down or sold out, we have quietly, steadily retained and even grew our marketshare. while our competition fought endless price, margin, and size wars with one another, we concentrated on having better products and better relationships with our customers. and, so, while the rest of the online used book industry was growing at 33% annually, we were growing at 133%. you might think that would be enough for us. not a chance. a great bottom line, is only as great as what you use it for. a triple bottom line means working towards the three goals of achieving profit, serving people, and preserving the environment as the benchmark measurements for a company's success. when "social entrepreneurship" was little more than an academic buzzword, we made our commitment to a triple bottom line. we funded and built our first public library in rural bolivia in 2004 - even before we became profitable as a company. that year we grew in inventory by about 10,000,000 books, had our first news article come out in a local business journal, sales went up several hundred percent, built our first library from the ground up, and we ended up losing almost $50,000. ok, so we missed the profit part of our triple bottom line, but that was fine by us. we decided that we needed to give even when it hurt, when we couldn't afford it. that kind of trial by fire forges core values. we lost a little bit of money the next year, too. so, we kept it up. we founded (and funded) our non-profit foundation, biblio charitable works (biblioworks, for short) in the autumn of 2005. the next month, we filled a freight container bound for south america with over 10,000 books, dozens of working computers, and educational materials. we did it about a year later - this time, with 12,000 books and untold thousands of dollars worth of donated library furniture from brodart. since 2005, we have built six more community libraries in bolivia. we have formed close partnerships with local organizations such as asheville-buncombe education coalition. we've held annual book drives. we offset every aspect of our business operations (including the shipment of every book sold!) by purchasing carbon offsets that are invested in renewable energy on small farms across the country. we've created great jobs for people, both locally, and in impoverished bolivia. we've distributed thousands and thousands of books to underprivileged children, inmates at local prisons, guests at local homeless shelters - and pretty much anyone who we could put a good book in the hands of. and, yes, somewhere along the way, we actually managed to get around to achieving the profit part of our triple bottom line. every great story has a quest. someone has to fight, and fight hard, to make people's lives better. otherwise, who cares if someone finds buried treasure? seven years and counting... we've grown, but we've proudly maintained our original vision, becoming a local bookstore on a global scale. every day we enable our customers - over a million book lovers from every country on earth - to find high-quality books. we've helped people get books they've spent years trying to find, and in the process, we've helped forge lasting relationships between book lovers and independent booksellers. our technology bridges geographies to help customers form old-fashioned relationships with small corner bookstores around the world. every day, we help small businesses in 45 countries develop and grow their businesses. we provide them with technology and tools that allow them to establish and strengthen their identity. we enable them to connect with their customers, and form new relationships. we love what we do. we love it because we have a chance to do something positive for the world around us. every day we strive to do a little something more in addition to our jobs. some days we create strategies for reducing our consumption in our office, reusing and recycling more, composting what we can. some days we collect, sort, and distribute free books to those in need. we're fortunate to do work we love, while making the world a little better along the way. we're proud of our achievements, but we're even more proud of who we've become as a company. in an epic story, that's called character development. the story of biblio.com is constantly moving forward and changing, while our triple bottom line remains constant. we don't know the end of this tale, but we can't wait to find out! thanks for sharing this, our story, with us. and thank you for letting us be a part of your story, too. brendan sherar founder & ceo (& quixotist) biblio.com asheville, nc about biblio.com why shop biblio? our story social responsibility meet the staff our booksellers get involved! your privacy terms of use press contact us "i was impressed with your story, your triple bottom line, and while you state you can't wait to see where it ends, i hope it never ends. we need so many more like you." -- rebecca, costa mesa ca advanced book search browse by subject browse by book list how to find used & out of print books discount books free shipping save 10% on every purchase! make-an-offer on select books! new books used & out-of-print books rare books how to be notified of new arrivals find rare books make-an-offer on rare books! book value learn about book collecting discount textbooks sell textbooks textbooks for schools tips for saving on textbooks online find bookshops find specialists become a biblio.com bookseller why support independent bookstores? bookish gear collectible books gift certificates sign up to receive offers and updates: services your account gift certificates 30-day return guarantee check order status purchase orders affiliate program help & faq about why shop at biblio? our story biblio staff our blog link to us contact us follow us on facebook social responsibility epic bottom line biblioworks carbon neutral shipping resources for booksellers book repair articles book collecting glossary select site privacy & security terms & conditions site map copyright © 2000-2013 biblio, inc. all rights reserved.
