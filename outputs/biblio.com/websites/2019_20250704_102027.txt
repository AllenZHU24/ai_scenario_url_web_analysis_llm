investing in the classics just like blue chip stocks, buying an established work or author can be a safe way to preserve your initial investment, even if you don't realize huge profit margins. the value of a work of incunabula isn't likely to plummet anytime soon. the basics no matter what you collect, a few basics apply. supply and demand: the value of a book is directly correlated to the market demand. every book has a first edition, but the value of the first edition as a collectible is a matter of the number of copies available and the number of people looking for them. condition, condition, condition. the value of a collectible book is based on the condition of a book. the most desirable copy of any book is a perfect copy. each flaw takes away from a book's value. when buying a collectible book, make sure and read the description carefully, and pay attention to the condition of the book and the dust jacket. jackets required for the most part, any book of fiction, and the majority of non-fiction published since around world war i was sold with a dust jacket. the dust jacket of a collectible book can be the most valuable part of the book, since it is the most fragile. a dust jacket on a rare collectible book can be 80% of the book's value. the earlier the better. in general, the earliest works by an author are the most valuable. this is due to a couple of reasons: very early works by an author tend to not sell as many copies. readers don't know the author's works yet, so they tend to not run out and buy their books as soon as they are published. since publishers know that tendency in readers, they often won't print as many copies of the first edition, making the supply of first editions scarcer. in part, the goal of collecting first editions is to go back to the source. if the first edition of the book is the closest to the original version of that work, the author's first published work is one step closer to the author. a signed manuscript is possibly the closest to the original source, and thus can bring the highest prices. a first edition means the first printing. the first edition of a book, for the purposes of collecting modern books, is the first printing of that book. the term "first thus"is used when describing a first printing of a later edition. have fun!
