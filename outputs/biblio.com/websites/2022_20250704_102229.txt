every month, biblio.com provides nativeenergy with reports on: all shipments of books ordered through our site, including international and domestic shipments the total estimated weight of all packages shipped the estimated mileage each book travels to reach its destination all energy consumed by our own office operations and employee commutes nativeenergy calculates our total carbon footprint based on those figures, and biblio.com, purchases investments in an equivalent amount of alternative energy projects. we purchase all of these offsets as part of our own business expenses, so there is no cost to either our customers or booksellers for offering the most environmentally-friendly choice for customers when purchasing their books online. what kind of renewable energy projects does this support? here are some carbon-offset programs that have been supported by biblio.com through our carbon neutral shipping: the owl feather war bonnet wind farm is a 60 mw wind farm being developed near the town of st. francis on the rosebud sioux reservation in south dakota a series of farm methane projects on family farms, principally in the mid-atlantic region, which reduce on-farm methane emissions from fossil fuel use, and which produce electricity that displaces grid generation. a series of distributed 40 kw wind turbines on family farms in the midwest, in partnership with next generation power systems. a series of mid-size (65 kw to 250 kw) wind turbines in alaska native villages which will displace electricity generated by diesel generators in the villages. why did we choose to partner with nativeenergy? while there are many excellent companies now in existence whose business is carbon-offsetting, nativeenergy is just the type of grassroots, community-focused organization with whom we want to be affiliated. nativeenergy helps build projects that not only provide viable alternative energy, but also create sustainable economic benefits for native americans and alaska native villages, and help family farmers compete with agribusiness. the goals of nativeenergy are synergistic with biblio.com's philosophy and business model. provides a global marketplace for independent booksellers in a way that allows them to compete with large corporations such as amazon.com and barnes & noble, while maintaining their independence and local identity. we also founded and continue to support biblioworks, an independent non-profit company that helps support literacy and has built seven community libraries in rural bolivia. this commitment to local, sustainable projects designed to benefit communities is clearly something that nativeenergy and biblio.com share. learn more about carbon offsets and climate change what's global warming? global warming refers the increase in the average temperature of the earth's near-surface air and oceans and its projected continuation. the global average air temperature near the earth's surface rose 0.74 ± 0.18°c (1.33 ± 0.32°f) over the past 100 years. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) concludes, "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations" via the greenhouse effect, "anthropogenic" meaning caused by human activity. what's carbon offsetting? when you purchase carbon offsets, you help fund projects that prevent one ton of greenhouse gases from being emitted for each ton that you have caused. carbon offset providers sell the greenhouse gas reductions associated with projects like wind farms or methane-capture facilities to customers who want to offset the emissions they caused by flying, driving, or using electricity. (though they're called "carbon" offsets, they offset all greenhouse gases that cause global warming, from carbon dioxide to methane.) what's carbon neutral? becoming carbon neutral means balancing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels by supporting renewable energy that creates a similar amount of useful energy, compensating for carbon dioxide emissions. the term also applies to using only renewable energy sources which do not produce emissions. here's what you can do? carbon offsetting is one of many economic actions you can take to address climate change, and it is a powerful one. many promising projects that would help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions lack the capital they need to get built; by directing your offset dollars to these projects, you can help finance new wind farms, solar arrays, and more. find out more... about biblio why shop at biblio? our story social responsibility carbon neutral shipping meet the staff our booksellers get involved! your privacy terms of use press contact us i was impressed with your story, your triple bottom line, and while you state you can't wait to see where it ends, i hope it never ends. we need so many more like you. rebecca, costa mesa ca can you guess which first edition cover the image above comes from? what was dr. seuss’s first published book? take a stab at guessing and be entered to win a $50 biblio gift certificate! read the rules here your answer your email address enter disregard this field trustpilot services your account gift certificates 30-day return guarantee check order status purchase orders coupons & promos affiliate program help & faqs about why shop at biblio? our story biblio staff jobs at biblio our blog link to us contact us social responsibility epic bottom line biblioworks carbon neutral shipping resources book collecting book collecting glossary sell books on biblio facebook instagram twitter privacy & security website accessibility terms & conditions site map copyright© 2022 biblio, inc. all rights reserved. biblio® is a registered trademark of biblio, inc. if you are using a screen reader and having problems using our website, please call 1-800-813-9432 (u.s.) or 1-828-350-0744 (outside the u.s.) monday - friday 10am-4pm est or email us anytime for assistance. biblio.com biblio.co.uk biblio.es biblio.com.au biblio.co.nz biblio.sg biblio.ie bookgilt this website uses cookies. we value your privacy and use cookies to remember your shopping preferences and to analyze our website traffic. manage your privacy settings. agree and close
