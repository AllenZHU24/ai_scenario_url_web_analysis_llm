purchase! it’s designed to reward our biggest fans — both frequent shoppers (reward after every 3 purchases!) as well as big spenders on indoor furniture, patio furniture, and even mattresses (furniture bonus on top of your reward!). big rewards also includes frequent 20% off coupons, free item weekends, big bucks coupons, 10% off for military/vets, a birthday surprise, and many other exclusive offers throughout the year. plus, the rewards you earn can be combined with most of our coupons! how do i join? it’s easy! and it takes less than a minute, and you’ll get a special welcome offer emailed to you within 3 days of signing up! your name, zip code, and email address are all we need, but giving us your phone number makes lookup go faster, and if you share your birth month, a birthday surprise will come your way! in-store, just ask an associate to help you sign up, or you can join online at biglots.com/rewards. physical big rewards cards are available when you sign up in store. if you enroll online, you’ll get a digital membership card. digital cardholders enjoy the same benefits, without the need for a physical card. a digital image of your big rewards card number is available in your online account under rewards card information. to get credit for your qualifying purchase, present the image of your big rewards card at time of purchase. you can display your card on a smartphone or print your card from your account page. if you ever want to switch from a physical big rewards card to a digital card, simply visit the my account page and choose 'create digital card.' use the same email address and personal information, and the rewards that you've earned will transfer to your new digital card. for additional details about the big rewards program, click here. to review your membership agreement, click here. how will i get my rewards? you will get notified about your available rewards within 7-14 days, depending on date of purchase, via the email address associated with your account. the email address associated with the big rewards account must be active and valid to receive rewards notifications. rewards emails are sent on fridays so check your inbox! you earn a rewards coupon with every three qualified purchases (with few exceptions). rewards are earned only when you identify yourself as a rewards member at checkout or are logged in to your account on biglots.com. if you don't have your card, in most stores an associate can look up your account by using your email address or phone number. can i access my rewards any other way? yes, you can log in to your account at biglots.com/rewards and check to see if you have any offers available at any time. we must have a valid email address for you to receive notifications. pro tip! bookmark the "my big rewards & offers" page on your phone (iphone or android) for quick and easy access to all your rewards and coupons when you shop. just open any big lots email, click on “my account” at the bottom of the email, which will take you directly to your my offers dashboard. bookmark the page on your phone. then just click the bookmark and you’ll have quick and direct access to all your offers, every time! what can i spend my reward on? almost everything! you can redeem rewards coupons on most regular price, sale, and clearance items in stores or on biglots.com. rewards can also be used on

products, eggs, gift cards, tax exempt products, existing price holds, special orders, or previously completed lease transactions. exclusions are subject to change. can i use more than one reward in a transaction? yes, you’ve earned it! you can use multiple types of rewards on the same in-store transaction. on biglots.com you’re limited to 2 total rewards discounts. please note when combining rewards with other rewards or coupons, percent-off rewards/coupons are always applied first, so the 2nd discount will be applied to the reduced balance. for amount-off rewards/coupons, each coupon scanned will reduce the balance available to be applied to the next offer. minimum purchase requirements apply for each coupon or offer. do i still earn a reward when i redeem a reward? you bet! redeeming a reward on a qualifying purchase counts toward earning your next reward. can i share my rewards or use them more than once? sorry, a reward can only be used one time. you can’t share your

stack their earned rewards with other rewards and most other coupons/offers. for non-earned offers or store promotions, please refer to the specific offer’s terms and conditions. do rewards expire? big rewards are currently valid for 17 days from the date they are loaded to your account. so, you have three full weekends to spend your rewards! do price-holds and special-orders apply? yes, they do! taking final delivery of your merchandise counts as another qualifying purchase. why didn’t i get my reward? we try to make it easy for you. there could be a few reasons why you aren’t seeing a reward on your account dashboard. some rewards are only valid for select members and are loaded directly to their big rewards card and cannot be shared some rewards may appear on an affiliate shopping site such as retailmenot or snip snap. these rewards may only be valid for intended recipients and are not shareable most rewards are valid for one-time use. the reward may have already been redeemed. once a reward expires or has been redeemed, it is no longer visible on your account your earned reward may not be available yet. big rewards members can see their earned reward in their account 7-14 days after their third qualifying purchase. members can earn one reward per week the reward may be expired. earned rewards are available for 17 days and expire on the coupon’s expiration date some rewards may be invitation-only or may be personalized to individual members based on previous purchase history for successful reward redemption, big rewards members must present a big rewards card or

qualifying purchases can i earn per day? you can earn one qualifying purchase, per store, per day. do transactions on biglots.com count as a qualifying purchase? yes! biglots.com counts as a separate

week (even on multiple qualifying purchases), with a max of $50. what is considered furniture? indoor furniture (sofas, loveseats, recliners, dining room, bedroom, and mattresses) as well as outdoor furniture (patio sets, gazebos, and umbrellas) purchased in store or on biglots.com. how is the furniture bonus calculated? it’s calculated based on the purchase amount before tax and shipping, and after other discounts and sales have been applied. if i spend $100 on a qualifying purchase, can i carry that forward to apply to my next furniture purchase? no, the furniture bonus has no carry-forward value. it’s applied on a per-purchase basis, so as long as your purchase is $200 or over, you’ll get your furniture bonus. what if i make more than one qualifying furniture purchase during the week? that’s ok! if more than one qualifying furniture purchase is made during a week (sun–sat), we will sum the total value for the week, but each purchase must be greater than $200. for example, you make a $250 furniture purchase on wednesday and another $400 purchase on friday, based on your $650 purchase total that week you would earn a $30 furniture bonus. purchases that fall outside this 7-day window are considered on a per-transaction basis. purchases less than $200 do not qualify. does my furniture purchase count toward my regular $5 reward? it sure does! with your qualifying furniture purchase, you’re that much closer to your next reward! what if i forget to link my purchase to my card when i buy furniture? to be eligible for the furniture bonus, furniture purchases must be linked to your big rewards account at the time of the transaction. please show your big rewards card to the cashier or provide your email address at the time of purchase. birthday
