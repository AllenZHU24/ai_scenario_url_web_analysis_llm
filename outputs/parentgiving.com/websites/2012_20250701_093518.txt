cavilon emollient cream this all-body emollient cream for moisturizing or preventing dry skin contains vitamins a, d, and e and is ph balanced to preserve skin's natural acid mantle. atrac-tain® moisturizing cream this formula with 10 percent urea and 4 percent aha softens and exfoliates severely dry, scaly, calloused, cracked skin. it’s fragrance- and preservative-free to prevent irritation. the formula is also latex, nitrile and vinyl glove compatible. remedy® phytoplex nourishing skin cream this soothing moisturizer helps restore skin's natural moisture balance and barrier properties. formulated with a blend of natural emollients, botanicals and essential fatty acids, including safflower oleosomes, carrageenan, oat kernel and licorice root extract, it absorbs readily into the skin with no greasy residue. as we get older, skin undergoes changes, even with healthy aging. because hormone levels decrease and skin isn’t as well hydrated as it used to be, it can easily get dry, even seriously so. the skin of your face as well as the rest of your body can benefit from a moisturizer or a moisture barrier cream. the texture of your skin barrier cream is important—the drier your skin, the richer the formulation you’ll need to create soft, supple skin. your appearance isn’t the only reason to nourish skin with an emollient-rich moisturizer, lotion or cream—dry skin tends to crack, and that’s like a highway on-ramp for bacteria to enter your body. skin is often good at absorbing some water when you bathe, shower or wash your face. the idea is to apply your skin cream while skin is still damp, to create a barrier against moisture loss. look for skin creams that contain ingredients designed for this job. remedy® phytoplex nourishing skin cream is a soothing moisturizer helps restore skin's natural moisture balance and barrier properties. formulated without mineral oil or other petrochemicals to remain breathable, it absorbs readily into the skin with no greasy residue. it moisturizes with a blend of natural emollients like safflower oil and soothes with oat kernel and licorice root extract plus other botanicals and essential fatty acids. if your skin is already cracking or peeling, you need an intensive treatment like triderma® extreme dryness plus, a fast acting medical strength formula that delivers intense moisture to dry, chapped, cracked skin. its skin protectants and natural healing properties allow it to lock in vital moisture and help reinforce skin’s natural protective barrier as it soothe redness itching and burning. to help exfoliate dry, flaky skin and reveal newer, fresher skin, look for products with alphahydroxy acids, or ahas. for moderate dryness, try atrac-tain® lotion therapeutic, a soothing lotion that relieves symptoms of moderately dry skin and maintains healthy skin with 5 percent urea and 2.5 percent aha. for more serious dryness, opt for the richer formula atrac-tain moisturizing cream with 10 percent urea and 4 percent aha to soften and exfoliate without potentially irritating fragrances or preservatives. heavier options include barrier creams, specialized, high-intensity skin care choices to use if your skin experiences repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants that can damage it, such as urine in the case of incontinence. part of your incontinence management strategy should be the regular use of a moisture barrier cream to create—just as it sounds—a barrier between skin and any urine or stool. another type of cream option is one with anti-fungal properties to help skin heal from these common infections. critic-aid clear antifungal moisture barrier cream is clear in appearance and acts as a moisture barrier against incontinence as it helps heal all skin irritations due to fungal infections. be extra gentle with the skin of your complexion and try targeted products for manage unique needs. for instance, tridrema® facial redness repair soothes skin irritated by conditions like rosacea. it contains professional strength anti-inflammatory ingredients, vitamins and carefully selected botanicals to quickly calm redness, balance and stabilize the skin. the bottom line is to remember to care for and protect your skin as you age—it’s still your body’s first line of defense against germs and other invaders showing page 1 out of 2 pages  next >> sort by: sort by name a-z

choosing the best lotions, creams & moisturizers choosing the best incontinence supplies and products skin care is an essential part of managing incontinence because urine and other wastes will irritate the skin and leave it vulnerable to infection. skin problems due to bowel and/or bladder incontinence are likely to occur if the right cleanser and protective ointment aren’t used. these problems can run the gamut from dry skin to dermatitis to pressure ulcers and pressure-related injuries, many of which result from the breakdown of skin’s protective barrier. skin care for the person with incontinence always aims to maintain the integrity of the skin. the best way to do this is by minimizing exposure to body wastes, which are powerful skin irritants; promptly treating any infections; and taking care to promptly heal damaged skin, if this happens. one good skin care practice is to avoid rubbing the skin to prevent epidermal stripping. effective skin care means doing away with the use of harsh soap, hot water and vigorous scrubbing, which tend to do more harm than good, and switching to gentle body washes and moisturizing products that protect the skin by shielding it from irritants and bacteria and reducing the amount of water loss through the skin. the available range of protective skin care products include creams, ointments, liquid films, powders, neutral ph cleansers and emollients. think convenience as well, especially when changing adult incontinence briefs. for instance, try disposable soft bathing cloths that feature ph-balanced, no-need-to-rinse cleansers and emollients. caregivers assisting in toileting are advised to practice their own good hygiene by using antimicrobial hand sanitizers or cleansers, which prevent transmission of infectious organisms. about us advertise with us buyer guides caregiver resources contact us coupons gift certificates institutional sales order status partner with us press room
