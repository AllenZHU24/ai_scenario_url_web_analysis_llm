and underpads disposable wipes and washcloths view all parentgiving picks booster pads what is a booster pad and how does it work? a booster pad is used in conjunction with a diaper / brief / absorbent underwear to provide additional absorption capacity. booster pads have no impermeable backing and allow a void to flow through and into the incontinence product. due to its flow-through design, a booster pad should never be used alone and should always be used with a diaper or brief. the right booster pad will increase the absorption capacity of your primary incontinence brief or pull-up by up to 12 ozs. generally, the longer the booster pad, the more absorption material it offers. for male users who tend to leak, booster pads can also be applied directly to and or wrapped around the penis to deflect the urine stream back into the incontinence brief or underwear. most typically, a booster pad is applied at nighttime for additional absorption capacity and to prevent or minimize leaks. it is very common to use a high capacity booster pad with a value-oriented brief for nighttime use - especially in assisted living facilities. always make sure to read the description so that you choose the booster pad that will work best when placed between the leg cuffs of your brief or diaper (call us directly if there are questions about the compatibility of a specific booster pad to pair with a specific brief or underwear model.) also check on the degree of protection as some booster pads are for light to moderate incontinence, while others can handle a heavier absorption amount. the following are our parentgiving picks for booster pads: starting at: $13.99$0.56each tranquility topliner super booster pad the tranquility topliner super booster pad features a
