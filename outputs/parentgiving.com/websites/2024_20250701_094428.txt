7,500 caregiving and adult care products from around 300 brands, we know exactly what our customers think about the protective products currently on the market. our caregiving team is made up of real caregivers, and our product team regularly tours adult diaper manufacturing facilities to stay on top of trends, improvements, and current technology. weâ€™ve compiled our expertise and customer feedback on fit, comfort, and affordability to give you spot-on recommendations and tips for choosing the right adult diaper or protective underwear brand for you. got more questions? this comprehensive guide includes expert answers on how to wear an adult diaper, incontinence remedies, common myths about adult diapers, and more. contents how we test adult diapers our top adult diaper picks what is adult incontinence? the anatomy of an adult diaper adult pull-ups vs. diapers with tabs choosing the best types of adult diapers premium vs. mass-produced incontinence products 5 steps to wearing an adult diaper top 3 myths about adult diapers natural remedies for managing incontinence government and insurance coverage are adult diapers or protective underwear right for you? how we test adult diapers and protective underwear when choosing the adult diapers and adult underwear to include in the guide below, we considered the following three sets of criteria: 1. popularity thereâ€™s a reason a particular brand or style of adult diaper or protective underwear gets purchased more often and with greater regularity than other brands or styles: it works. repeat purchases often indicate a good product that satisfies users and caregivers. 2. ratings we give you real-world insight into different incontinence products by looking at actual customer product reviews. because these ratings relate directly to usersâ€™ experiences, they grant us information that canâ€™t be gathered from sales or laboratory data alone. 3. lab testing of course, our testing wouldnâ€™t be complete without certified third-party lab results that provide us with information about adult diaper absorbency, drying rate, and other important performance points. all incontinence products use lab testing, but not all lab testing is equal. we adhere to strict guidelines and best practices in all our lab testing how our lab testing works at parentgiving, we use comprehensive testing methods recommended by the national association of continence (nafc) and edana, and we collaborate with sgs-ips, a globally recognized testing organization, to ensure our tests are thorough and practical. while total absorption capacity is commonly used to market adult diapers, it doesn't reflect real-world use. we rely on industry-standard tests that mimic actual conditions and conduct these tests through third-party labs in europe and the u.s. over the last three years, we've tested around 40 different incontinence products. weâ€™ve updated our findings based on three main categories: retention capacity under pressure this test measures how much liquid the absorbent core of an adult diaper can hold under pressure, simulating real-world conditions like body weight and positioning. following sgs-ips standard wsp 70.10, we test each product by dunking the garment in water and placing it in a centrifuge. the remaining liquid in the core is measured to determine absorbency. we also assess the top sheet and leak guards to see how effectively they prevent leaks and protect the skin. rate of acquisition (roa) the rate of acquisition or roa measures how quickly a product absorbs liquid. a lower number indicates better absorption, reducing skin contact with wetness and lowering the risk of irritation and leaks. following sgs-ips standard nwsp 70.9/ips-t022, we test by adding a saline solution to the garment and measuring the time it takes to absorb. repeated doses are administered to test the consistency of the absorption speed. rewet rate the rewet rate tests how quickly the garment's surface feels dry after absorbing liquid. a lower rewet rate means a drier feel during use. following the roa test, we test by placing pre-weighed filter paper on the product, applying a weight to simulate body pressure, and measuring the liquid absorbed by the paper. our top adult diaper & protective underwear picks the test results are in, and here are our top picks for the best adult diapers and protective underwear in 2024. after testing over 20 brands, weâ€™ve made your choices easier by dividing our selections into four categories: our top two overall picks the best

and nerves that help the bladder hold and release urine. it is a common condition that typically occurs as you age. if you or a loved one have experienced problems with leaking urine or making it to the bathroom in time, this may be a sign of urinary incontinence issues. over 25 million americans experience some form of incontinence. many endure it in silence, taking an average of 5 years before talking to a healthcare provider about it. with statistics like these, it's likely that there are people close to you who are also struggling but are hesitant to discuss it. most cases of incontinence are treatable and easily managed with physical therapy, medication, hygienic products, or a combination of all three. these solutions allow you to live more comfortably and find diapers that fit how you want them to. incontinence diapers for the elderly are a great solution for adults struggling with mobility issues. they can help you address your incontinence issues and live a more dignified life. options for a super absorbent adult diaper come in different styles, sizes, purposes, and absorbency. don't forget to explore the best booster pads for adults and our many incontinence products for youth. the anatomy of an adult diaper understanding the anatomy of an adult diaper or an adult diaper brief can help you make the right selection for yourself or someone in your care. while all adult diapers share basic anatomy, it's important to remember that construction, material types, material quality, and other considerations affect performance. below, we've listed the elements of a modern adult diaper or incontinence garment, along with some tips to consider when looking for a high-quality product. key elements of an adult diaper elastic waistband the elastic waistband provides a secure and comfortable fit around the waist. it ensures the diaper stays in place during movement and helps with leakage protection by maintaining a snug fit. adhesive tape adhesive tape is used to secure the diaper in place. high-quality adhesive tape ensures a firm hold and allows easy adjustments without losing stickiness. poor-quality adhesive tape can result in the diaper coming loose, causing discomfort and potential leaks. top sheet an adult diaper's top sheet is the first point of contact for any liquid. all top sheets are hydrophilic, allowing liquids to easily pass into the absorbent core. a good top sheet should also be resistant to breakdown so that none of the inner absorbent material pushes out. the top sheet is exceptionally soft in high-quality incontinence garments, making them more comfortable for extended wear. acquisition distribution layer (adl) the acquisition distribution layer or adl sits between the top sheet and the absorbent core. it directs liquid toward the core and distributes it across the entire core area to maximize absorption and retention. it also acts as a liquid storage area until the liquid is fully absorbed by the core and functions as a barrier to protect against rewet. absorbent core the absorbent core is the working part of any adult diaper where liquid is directed, absorbed, and retained. it consists of a blend of superabsorbent polymers (sap) and fluff: superabsorbent polymers (sap): these materials can absorb up to 300 times their weight in fluid, transforming it into a gel to prevent leakage. fluff: typically made of cellulose fibers, fluff provides softness, aids in the even distribution of liquid, and accelerates the rate of acquisition. the right balance of sap and fluff is essential in an incontinence garment. too much sap will yield a bulky and uncomfortable core, while too much fluff means lower absorption and retention. back sheet the back sheet is the outer layer of the diaper, designed to keep skin dry and protect clothing. it is typically made of a waterproof material that holds moisture in while allowing air to pass, ensuring breathability and comfort. leak guard leak guards are the elastic ruffles around the legs that force urine back into the core. this feature is absent in some products, which separates great incontinence products from average ones. high-quality leak guards should be made from an excellent hydrophobic, nonwoven material, provide a high barrier, and not stick to the top sheet when opened. they should also have good elasticity to follow the body's shape and movement. leg cuff leg cuffs are elastic bands around the leg openings that help contain leaks and reduce chafing. they ensure a snug fit around the legs, preventing urine from escaping and providing additional security. more features to look for breathability breathability refers to an adult diaper's capacity to allow perspiration to pass through materials, enabling the skin to “breathe” better. achieving good breathability is complex because back sheets must hold in moisture while allowing air to pass in and out of the garment. to accomplish this, the best adult diapers use materials and construction methods that prioritize breathability. use of nonwovens just as the name suggests, nonwoven materials are not woven fabrics; they are made from natural or synthetic fibers that are bonded together chemically, thermally, or mechanically. apart from the absorbent core, nonwoven materials are a key component of any adult diaper, playing a crucial role in its functionality. in the most absorbent adult diapers, the top sheet, back sheet, side panels, and other components are typically made of nonwoven materials, often polypropylene-based or polymer-based. welded seams, waistbands, and side panels when choosing an incontinence product, look for one made with high-quality materials and ultrasonic seam welding rather than thermal welding. ultrasonic seam welding uses ultrasonic waves to join materials without stitching or adhesives, creating smooth and seamless bonds. this helps minimize skin irritation, maximize comfort, and provide a more discreet appearance. by using welded seams, waistbands, and side panels, the garment's performance is enhanced, the wearer's comfort is improved, and the caregivers' experience is made easier. high-quality construction even with great materials, an adult diaper is only as good as the construction of the finished product. proper construction requires new and properly maintained machinery, skilled operators, and quality control. poor construction, such as inadequate closure tape, too much or too little glue, or missing side anti-leak barriers, can result in embarrassing leaks, irritation to sensitive skin, and a lack of confidence for users and caregivers who require easy removal options with maximum protection. adult pull-up diapers vs. diapers with tabs looking for more options? you may prefer an adult pull-up diaper or a diaper with tabs. adult pull-up diapers adult pull-up diapers are very similar to regular underwear. they have a unified waistband and two-leg openings. the pull-up style allows these diapers to go up and down just like regular underwear, and they come in various sizes and absorbency levels. the main difference between regular underwear and adult diapers is that adult diapers are made to be more absorbent to hold larger amounts of urine. the leak guards and absorbent core are waterproof and can last up to 8 hours.ideal user: active persons experiencing light to heavy incontinence. adult diapers with tabs adult diapers with tabs are similar to pull-ups but include two tabs on either side of the waistline. these tab-style garments are a perfect solution for a caregiving setting. they make placing the brief on an immobile or bedridden person easier, removing the need to sit upright.ideal user: less active persons with physical limitations and heavy to severe absorbency needs. choosing the best type of adult diapers various adult diapers are available to help manage incontinence symptoms and maintain an active lifestyle. here's how to choose the right product for your needs: volume of leakage diapers are available in various absorbency levels, making it tricky to know where to start. it's best to experiment to find the right fit, but we recommend starting with a higher absorbency and then scaling back if needed. it's much easier to change the type of diaper than to deal with a costly leak on a mattress or clothing. don't forget to consider the time of day you'll wear the diaper, as the best overnight adult diapers offer high absorbency. size and shape of your body fit is just as important as absorbency. if your adult diaper does not fit you properly, you will almost definitely experience leakage. it will take some trial and error, but you want to ensure the diaper is snug and comfortable around your waist. if it's too tight, it can cause skin damage and compression leaks. the fit around the legs is also very important. if you have thinner legs, try going down a size and vice versa. if you’re a side sleeper experiencing leaks, we recommend checking your leg fit first. lifestyle if you are active and looking for a discreet diaper to wear throughout the day, try pull-on style diapers or depends diapers. consider diapers with tabs if you have a low activity level or spend more time in bed. for more senior bed products, check out our helpful bed rails. type of incontinence consider whether you experience urinary or fecal incontinence. depending on the use case, you will also want to educate yourself on how often to change the diaper. for heavy absorbency, check out our underwear for bowel incontinence. purchasing tips when you buy incontinence products at the store or online, pay attention to the sizing charts on the packaging. these include indicators of absorbency level, usually shown as a series of 5 or 6 water drops. bariatric adult diaper fit for bariatric products, there are fewer pull-on options due to the challenging ratio between the waist and leg measurements. tape-on products are ideal as they offer a better fit. premium vs. mass-produced incontinence products an incontinence product’s effectiveness and quality can vary widely. most people start with mass-produced products, like depends or tena. while these products may serve the needs of some, a premium incontinence product is a better fit for most users and caregivers. what do premium incontinence products offer that mass-produced products cannot? not only do they use higher quality materials, better designs, and the best construction methods, but they also perform better than mass-produced products in a number of crucial areas, including: smell top sheet performance and comfort fabric quality, durability, and feel tear-away side stability and function leg cuff quality and dependability discreetness comfort most importantly, there are notable differences in absorbency levels between mass-produced and premium brands. take a look at these testing results to see the difference when you go premium: absorbency levels: mass-produced vs. premium brands absorbency level mass market brands premium brands moderate 2 - 6 oz 5 - 12 oz heavy 6 - 9 oz 12 - 18 oz overnight 12 oz 20+ oz -for moderate absorbency needs, premium diapers absorb about 2-6 oz more than mass market brands. 5 steps to wearing an adult diaper whether it’s a standard design or a pull-up style,

to fit? to prevent leaks, an adult diaper should be worn snugly with no gaps. product sizes vary by brand, with some focusing on waist measurement and others on weight. if available, try a sample before purchasing a pack. for users with a larger waist and thinner legs, gaps at the leg holes may occur. to adjust this, use a booster pad to provide additional absorption and reduce leakage. remember: a larger size does not mean more absorbency. always choose a garment based on the brand's sizing criteria. step 2: unpack the diaper for standard diapers: carefully unfold the diaper, ensuring you do not touch the inside. make sure the adhesive tabs are accessible and the leak guards are properly positioned. for pull-up diapers: make sure to refrain from touching the inside of the diaper while unruffling it. carefully take out the leak guards from the diaper’s containment zone if applicable. step 3: position the diaper for standard diapers: place the back side of the diaper against your lower back while you or your caregiver aligns the front of the diaper between your legs, ensuring the diaper is centered. for pull-up diapers: insert one leg at a time into the diaper and pull it up like wearing pants, making sure that the taller side remains in the back. step 4: secure the diaper for standard diapers: secure the adhesive tabs on each side of the diaper, starting with the bottom and then the top, ensuring a snug fit without being too tight. for pull-up diapers: adjust the diaper to ensure comfort and proper fit. the containment zone should be in direct contact with your body for the odor and leak lock system to be effective. step 5: take off the diaper for standard diapers: unfasten the adhesive tabs and remove the disposable diaper. discard it in the garbage can, and avoid flushing it down the toilet, as this can cause clogging. for pull-up diapers: tear the sides of the pull-up diaper and dispose of it in the garbage can. avoid flushing it down the toilet to prevent clogging. top 3 myths about adult diapers by debunking common misconceptions about adult diapers, we can make better product choices and improve incontinence management. here are three prevalent myths about adult diapers to reconsider: myth #1. the double-up works because many people's first experience with an adult diaper is with a lower quality, mass-produced product, they often feel doubling up will solve problems related to leaks and scent. unfortunately, the double-up rarely, if ever, works. besides being a waste of product and money, doubling up a diaper is not a dignified way for an individual to handle incontinence. instead, try researching which clothing items can better address your concerns, testing a higher quality product, or using your current product more frequently. whatever the problem, doubling up is unlikely to solve it. myth #2. plastic outer garments work best it's a common misconception that a plastic outer garment is the best choice for controlling leaks. but, as we know, plastic is not breathable, and an incontinence product must be breathable for true comfort and protection. plus, many complain about the noisiness of plastic garments. instead, choose an incontinence garment that is breathable, silent, and constructed of high-quality materials that will ensure better protection and comfort. many cloth-like products feel like regular underwear, while a plastic outer garment often feels bulkier and less discreet. myth #3. any secondary diaper product will do there are a number of secondary products and accessories available that can adapt and improve the performance of an adult diaper, but not all products work as intended. for example, putting a bladder control pad inside an adult diaper will not improve or extend absorption or retention. it may even reduce the quality of the fit and lead to leaks. a booster pad is recommended to boost a diaper's absorption and retention. natural remedies for managing incontinence although incontinence may be out of your control, some natural remedies can help manage your symptoms. here are some mindsets and lifestyle recommendations: perform kegel exercises kegel exercises help strengthen the muscles in your bladder that hold the urine back. in addition to specific exercises you can do in the gym, simply "bearing down" and squeezing your pelvic muscles for 4-10 seconds at a time for just 5 minutes a day can start to impact bladder control and strengthen your urinary muscles. restrict bathroom frequency train your bladder by developing a urination schedule. start by urinating every hour and then gradually increase the interval, trying to hold off a bit longer between bathroom trips. your body may slowly become accustomed to anticipating when you'll have the opportunity to urinate again. be hygienic practicing good hygiene decreases the risk of urinary tract infections. women should always wipe from front to back to prevent fecal contamination of the vaginal area and improve urinary tract health. monitor your weight obesity can cause increased pressure on the bladder and make it more difficult to get to the bathroom and remove clothing in time. for more toilet accessories, check out our toilet aid for the obese. also, be sure to check out wheelchair options for the obese and our wheelchairs that come apart. avoid constipation constant straining can weaken the bladder and bowel muscles. eat a fiber-rich diet, and let your doctor know if you are not passing your bowels frequently enough or if your stools are difficult to pass. for ultimate protection, check out our underwear for bowel incontinence. don't keep your symptoms a secret 1 in 3 people experience incontinence symptoms at some point in their life, yet most keep it a secret. while it may feel embarrassing, dealing with symptoms alone isn't worth the struggle. discuss your incontinence with your doctor so they can provide the information you need to live with your condition. do not suffer in silence. avoid foods that irritate the bladder spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine, and foods with high acid content, such as tomato sauce, citrus fruits, and even cranberry juice, can irritate the bladder. sodas can be particularly harmful because their carbonation, caffeine, and acidic components can also irritate the bladder. monitor fluid intake it's crucial for your body to maintain a healthy level of hydration to protect your kidneys, produce urine, and flush out infections. however, be mindful of drinking more water than necessary. consult with your doctor to establish the appropriate daily fluid intake for your individual needs and help you stay properly hydrated without overdoing it. avoid diuretics before bed remember that diuretic medications make you expel water. avoiding them right before bedtime may prevent you from waking up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. it's important to work with your doctor to create a medication schedule that won't disrupt your sleep with frequent trips to the bathroom. government and insurance coverage will the government or medicaid pay for adult diapers? unfortunately, medicare does not typically cover absorbent products such as incontinence diapers for the elderly. medicare is more likely to cover other non-absorbent products, such as catheters and related items. even when attempting to get coverage, you must have a physician's prescription stating the necessary treatment. for those costs not covered, the state may offer assistance to help manage out-of-pocket expenses. are adult diapers or protective underwear right for you? adult diapers and protective underwear can enhance your comfort and confidence. consider your daily habits, incontinence level, and budget to find the right option for you. active individuals should choose garments designed for mobility and a snug fit, while those with limited mobility should prioritize maximum absorbency and comfort. evaluate the severity of your incontinence to select the right absorbency level, including overnight options. you'll want to strike a balance between quality and affordability, so consider exploring bulk purchasing or subscription services. don't forget to check if your insurance covers part of the cost. it's also a good idea to experiment with different brands and styles that offer adjustable tabs and odor control to find the best solution for your needs. taking these steps can bring you greater freedom and peace of mind. who knows? adult diapers or protective underwear might
