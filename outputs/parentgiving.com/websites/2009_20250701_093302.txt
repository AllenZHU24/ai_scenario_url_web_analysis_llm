"pain seemed to differ not only on an individual basis, but also in different daily situations. it is clear that pain at rest is a particular issue that needs addressing as residents rated this much higher than caregivers and relatives. using a simple pain intensity scale, like the 0 to 10 scale employed in our study, is clearly not enough. we would like to see nurses use a combination of the existing pain intensity scale, together with multi-dimensional pain observations scales to judge how much discomfort a patient is experiencing. we are also keen to ensure that relatives receive more information on chronic pain and that both relatives and nurses explore pain relief methods that don't always rely on drugs. these can include massage, applying warmth, encouraging residents to be more mobile and distractions such as music and storytelling," said dr. van herk. more elder care news and newsletter archive 3 super foods for seniors recent long-term research studies have pointed to a number of essential nutrients that many seniors lack, but that are especially valuable for those who have a risk or history of heart disease, stroke or alzheimer’s disease. here are three “super foods” that are loaded with these essential nutrients. so go ahead and eat up! by kathy n. johnson, phd, cmc full story | more articles on nutrition necessities  | you could win $3,500 in prizes! win a great getaway for you and respite care for your loved one! learn more find: independent living assisted/alzheimer's lvg homecare (non-medical) adult day services nursing home home health care hospice continuing care (ccrc) geriatric care manager senior move manager home remodelers in: family caregivers share the challenges they are facing, the rewards they are experiencing and how they are balancing their lives with taking care of their elderly parents. read more © copyright 2009 parentgiving, inc.all rights reserved. all content on parentgiving.com, including articles, newsletters, and news, is for information only and not intended to diagnose, treat or advise on medical, health, legal, financial or other issues. see additional information. use of this website is subject to our terms of use and privacy policy. learning center care manager services shop elder care products in the news caregiver resources about us advertise with us partner with us press terms of use privacy policy sitemap
