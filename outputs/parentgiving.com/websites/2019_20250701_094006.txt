first order!* sign up view details about parentgiving.com - dedicated to caregiving and elder care by caregivers – for caregivers, and the aging every single employee at parentgiving, from our award winning customer care team to our management team and even our interns, has been a caregiver, or has personal family experience with the aging process. having caregiver experience is mandatory and is a pre-requisite for our hiring and recruiting process. we can teach and train on product knowledge and application, we cannot teach empathy for the aging process. that context of understanding for caregiving and the aging is critical to our success and critical to our service offering. parentgiving.com was formed in 2008 when its founders struggled to find help and answers since becoming caregivers for their own parents. noticing a lack of a cohesive and comprehensive resources for caregivers, the parentgiving.com founders set out to help others while helping themselves by bringing together the best information, support and products in one place on the internet. the best customer care team on the planet! personal experience as caregivers every single person on our customer care team have been, or currently are family caregivers. we have personal experience with every aspect of aging from incontinence to dementia, alzheimer’s, and home hospice care. we have amassed over 50,000 hours of customer care time and have assisted well over 200,000 customers – many of whom come back monthly for personalized consultations or product recommendations. on-going and in-depth product training with over 300 brands and in excess of 7500 product skus, it takes a lot of product training to keep up with the latest advances in aging products. our best manufacturers make a beeline for our offices here in montclair new jersey to conduct in-service training – we usually welcome manufacturer reps and product managers about twice a month. from pressure prevention devices to mobility scooters to lift chairs to the latest incontinence products – we pull our whole customer care team together and have collaborative training sessions with product experts. our management team tours product factories throughout the country to offer trend insight and customer feedback and to form a continuous loop on product improvements. helping you find the right products for aging in place – the first time so many of our customers state "we wish we found parentgiving a long time ago." outfitting a home for aging in place requires detailed insight and understanding. finding the right incontinence product mix and frequency should not by trial by error. with our industry best knowledge and experience, we help our client customers save time, money, and frustration by expertly guiding them to the right products the first time. only the best products – which are not found at the local supermart or pharmacy we scour the universe of products and our supply chains to offer up only the highest rated and most applicable merchandise. many of our best-selling products are healthcare products that are not offered in retail stores. we "curate" these products and solicit reviews from our caregiver customers to deem which products are the "best". the highest-rated and best-selling items are often promoted on our site and in our catalogs because they have a proven track record – and ensure a great experience for our customers. many of our incontinence customers have found us because the store brands just don’t offer enough absorbency, comfort or quality. all of products are 100% first quality and can be traced directly to the manufacturer. the same cannot be said of some of our online peers and/or marketplaces where assisted living facilities or bulk buying operations divert goods to consumers via online faux stores. discreet home delivery and super fast shipping 95% of our orders go from click to door in one to two business days!!! our supply chain network is located strategically across the country and all of our warehouses ship orders the same day that an order is received (before 5:00 pm). we employ secure carriers like ups or fedex to ensure a trackable package from source to door and we ship in discreet packaging (plain boxes) to protect your privacy. saturday delivery is included in a majority of orders as well. no longer does a person have to suffer the hassle and embarrassment of buying a 20 lb case of incontinence supplies at the local mart, lug it out to your car, and then trudge it in to your home. 2% back on all purchases – with no annual membership fee we honor our loyal customers with 2% back on all purchases via the parentgiving rewards program. our loyalty program requires no upfront or annual fee, and points can be redeemed on subsequent purchases in increments of $5 and higher. auto delivery / recurring order program enroll online or have one of our dedicated customer care experts set up your auto delivery subscription for regularly scheduled shipments. auto delivery subscribers get 5% off and free-shipping and a price lock guarantee for at least six months – and the parentgiving points program provides

express and discover cards. additionally, we offer paypal, paypal credit (formerly bill me later), and personal check if you prefer. connect with us facebook twitter youtube google+ company info about
