$18.99 choosing the best foams & cleansers aloe vesta cleansing foam aloe vesta is a non-aerosol cleansing foam that shampoos hair as well as cleans the entire body. the rich, thick foam won’t drip or run for easy cleaning and clean-up. it’s also alcohol-free and ph balanced and won’t leave any irritating soap residue on the skin. cavilon one-step skin care lotion this cleansing lotion has ingredients that clean and moisturize with a skin protectant. a complete skin care system in one product, use the lotion as an alternative to soap and water for general bathing or incontinence care that helps prevent dry skin. remedy® phytoplex hydrating spray cleanser use this gentle spray cleanser for a uniform, no-rinse application on hair, face and the entire body. the formula contains conditioners to help minimize friction; it goes on easily and can be used on intact, irritated or denuded skin. as we age, skin becomes thinner and may have fewer natural oils to stave off dryness. gentle cleansing is essential. mobility issues may mean that you or your caregiver needs to use a skin cleanser that is easy to apply and possibly one that doesn’t need rinsing. depending on dexterity, you may be able to get more effective cleansing with a spray or foam, and having one product for shampooing and a body wash can streamline the whole process, too. no-rinse skin cleansers offer certain advantages including quicker hygiene, less irritating residue and no need for water—water can worsen dryness because it washes away some of the skin’s natural lipids. if your skin is already dry, look for a moisturizing skin cleanser like remedy® phytoplex hydrating cleansing foam, a no-rinse gentle formula that’s easy to apply and easy to remove with a wipe or washcloth. enhanced with botanicals, it's ph balanced to protect skin's acid mantle. looking for a light cleanser for the bath or shower? try low-sudsing gels and liquids that rinse easily. soothe & cool® shampoo/body wash offers gentle, effective cleansing and conditioning with a ph balance for everyday use. it has a light scent that leaves hair and skin smelling fresh and clean. an antimicrobial skin cleanser will help eliminate bacteria and prevent the spread of germs, an important part of flu and cold season protection. remedy 4-in-1 antimicrobial cleanser cleans, moisturizes, helps provide protection against microorganisms and nourishes the skin in one step unlike harsh soaps that strip skin of moisture. its ingredients include a blend of antioxidants, amino acids and vitamins with natural and organic oils that mimic the body's natural lipids and gently cleanse skin without stripping it of its own oils. the same 4-in-1 approach is available in a no-rinse foam. showing page 1 out of 1 pages

related buyer guides: choosing the best foams & cleansers choosing the best skin care older adults may require special gentler care for their skin, which may have become more fragile and much thinner than it once was. preserving its natural barrier and preventing dryness along with adequate hygiene involves using skin cleansers and non-alkaline cleansing agents. gentle and protective skin cleansers are often liquid solutions or emulsions or cleansing foams formulated to remove bacteria and skin irritants such as perspiration, wound secretions and urine. popular skin cleansers contain water and a surface active agent (called a surfactant) to help loosen dirt or soil from the skin without causing damage to it. the gentle, loosening action of skin cleansers makes vigorous rubbing with washcloths unnecessary, minimizing the chances of mechanical damage to the skin. skin cleansers often come with antimicrobials, to help eliminate bacteria and prevent odor. dyes or fragrances are sometimes on the ingredient list, but note that these substances have the potential to cause adverse reactions. skin cleansers are formulated as “rinse” or “no-rinse” preparations. cleansing foam products are usually no-rinse formulations. the no-rinse skin cleansers offer certain advantages including a shorter period needed for the bathing/cleansing activity, the absence of residues which can contain potential irritants and eliminating the need for water (water can cause skin dryness as it washes away some skin lipids). regardless of which skin cleansers are chosen, it is important to make sure the cleanser ph is compatible with skin’s ph and that it leaves minimal amounts of residue. special cleansers are also available for perineal skin, for face and hair, for wounds, and for general use. about us advertise with us buyer guides caregiver resources contact us coupons gift certificates institutional sales order status partner with us press room privacy policy return policy rewards
