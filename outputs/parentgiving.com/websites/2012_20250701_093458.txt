latest newsflash depend’s double whammy: charitable contributions + comfortable discretion = incontinence win october 23, 2012 by mary otte, staff writer for parentgiving.com on april 3, 2012, depend, america’s top brand in incontinence supplies, launched the great american try on challenge to benefit two charity organizations, “the v foundation for cancer research” and “dress for success worldwide.” the launch was also for the benefit of the approximate 56 million americans living with bladder control issues via depend’s latest offerings: depend for men real fit briefs and the silhouette briefs for women, described by parent company kimberly-clark as, “discreet, game changing products...to help give people living with bladder control issues the confidence to enjoy an active lifestyle.” to help build that confidence, depend recruited super active professional football stars wes walker, clay matthews, and demarcus ware, who wore the depend real fit for men briefs under their skin tight uniforms, and performed field drills on camera without any visible restraint or underwear lines. actress lisa rinna modeled the women’s silhouette briefs under a form-fitting gown in a red carpet setting, and looked just as stunning as usual. for donning the bladder control briefs, the celebrities were able to contribute to charity via the depend campaign, but they were also given the chance to show americans that the stigma surrounding incontinence needs to be stopped in its tracks. “i was so intrigued when the depend brand approached me to take part in the great american try on,” said rinna, “but why not try it on? it’s really important that women aren’t embarrassed by this common condition, and in the process i’m thrilled to support one of my favorite causes, dress for success (dressforsuccess.org).” speaking for the men, new england patriots wide receiver wes welker said, “clay, demarcus, and i tried on the new depend real fit briefs to show men that they can still be active as they want to be while wearing the briefs. we’re also proud that our involvement...is benefiting the v foundation in its work to find a cure for all types of cancers, and specifically prostate cancer, a leading cause of bladder control issues in men. on behalf of all of us, the depend brand will donate $75,000 to the v foundation (jimmyv.org) to fund prostate cancer research.” and this isn’t their first altruistic venture. in 2010, depend for men ran the “campaign to end prostate cancer,” teaming up with major league baseball star ken griffey sr. and other top athletes like football pro len dawson, whose wife’s insistence that he go for a prostate psa screening saved his life, and four time world champion hockey player mike bossy. since kimberly-clark’s introduction of the depend brand in 1984, they’ve come to enjoy around 50% of the market share in adult diapers. at parentgiving, we think it’s wonderful for them to give back to the people, both in charity and improved design, which makes us all the more proud to be vendors of the depend for men and women incontinence supplies. october 23, 2012 depend’s double whammy: charitable contributions + comfortable
