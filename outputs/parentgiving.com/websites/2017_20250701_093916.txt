sale low to high sort by rating high to low sort by rating low to high sort by: unique wellness diapers wellness products manufactures both the wellness absorbent underwear, the original unique wellness brief, and the new and improved superio brief. all products are engineered based on similar design and construction details employed by nasa in the development of maximum absorbency garments (mags).nasa developed mags to support space missions where astronauts on space shuttle missions are required to remain in the protective suit for long periods of time. wellness products, like nasa's mags, employ super absorbent polymers that can absorb up to 60 times its own volume, and its proprietary incontek design is a triple layered core where urine is absorbed to the innermost core, keeping the surface dry and the user comfortable without skin irritation.wellness products are engineered to hold copious amounts of liquid — up to 87 ounces — and therefore require less changes than institutional type incontinence products. wellness products absorb wetness away from the user's skin to maintain skin health and avoid common dermatitis issues associated with prolonged exposure to urine. as is the case with most super absorbent incontinence products sold by parentgiving, less changes and less diapers used equates to lower total cost, less laundering, and uninterrupted sleep for users and caregivers for those using these products at home. compare connect with us facebook twitter youtube google+ company info about us contact us order status press room services & support auto
