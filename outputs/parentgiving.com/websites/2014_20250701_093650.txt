choosing the best bed rails for elderly accidentally falling out of bed can lead to serious injury, especially for an older person at risk for a broken bone. using a bed rail chosen to meet your individual needs and accommodate your particular bed can help prevent such accidents. bed rails for elderly are especially appropriate for people who, due to physical disabilities or the side effects of medications, may not be able to keep themselves from falling or rolling out of bed. beyond providing a secure sleeping environment, most safety bed rails for seniors can also help you sit up or shift position in bed on your own. safety bed rails further reduce the risk of falling if you’re in a hospital bed that needs to be moved. your first step is to choose the correct type of bed rail. bedside assist rails, for instance, allow you to more easily get in and out of bed, but are not usually the type of bed rail that can keep you from falling out of bed. here are the most popular types of bed rails for elderly people and the purpose they each serve: safety bed rails for elderly are longer rails with a fixed length, primarily designed to keep you from rolling or falling out of bed. double bed rails come as a pair, with one for each side of the bed. rails for adjustable beds are designed to fit adjustable beds such as a craftmatic bed. adjustable bed rails for seniors can be adjusted in length and/or height. hospital bed rails for elderly typically bolt on the bed frame or attach to the bed's springs. assist bed rails are usually smaller rails or sometimes just a handle designed primarily to give you support while getting in and out of bed. great for travel, portable bed rails are lightweight, easy to remove, fold up and re-install. be sure to view these great bed
