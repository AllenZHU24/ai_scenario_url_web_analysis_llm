and help with your balance or are shopping for an elderly parent, our quality selection of walkers will assist you will your specific needs. walkers are a stable walking aid that have a large base of support and come in various sizes, styles and features. shop our inventory for folding walkers, specialty walkers and standard walkers, as well as walker accessories. with brands such as cardinal health, medline, lumex and nova filling our growing inventory, you can be assured of the exceptional craftsmanship and durability of each walker. as the name suggests, a standard walker is the traditional style that one often thinks of when they think of a walker. they are designed withâ four legs and have a light metal frame. they come with or without wheels, and also come in sizes that are made for bariatric patients. they frequently have a front cross brace that provides additional walker durability and a greater stride as well as contoured handgrips for comfort. our selection of folding walkers for seniors is perfect for someone with limited mobility who enjoys traveling, needs help getting to and from doctor appointments or likes to go shopping. made from sturdy aluminum construction that's lightweight, yet offers maximum strength, these folding designs frequently have a trigger release feature that allows the user (or caregiver) to close the walker without removing their hands from the handle, making it ideal for individuals with limited finger dexterity. our specialty walkers are designed to address specific needs. a hemi walker, for example, is designed for people who only have the use of one hand or arm. it's lighter than a walker yet more stable than a cane and can even fold easily with one hand. other specialty walkers include knee walkers, which are a terrific way for those recovering from foot surgery, breaks, sprains and other foot injuries to get around comfortably and safely. view more choosing the best walkers walkers are mobility aids for people who need help with balance and more support than a cane provides but aren&rsquot suited to the faster pace of a rollator which requires hand strength to work the brakes and the ability of your legs to keep up. walkers call for some degree of upper body strength because you place more weight on your arms as you lift the aid up and down a step ahead of you instead of pushing it forward.the standard walker design has four legs and a light metal frame. some models offer color choices to make the walker more stylish. putting glides on the leg tips will allow the walker to move more smoothly.as its name indicates front wheel walkers have wheels instead of tips on the front two legs. wheels in front eliminate the need to pick up the walker to advance it and make for smoother easy movement. again walker glides can be put on the rear leg glides to make maneuvering even smoother (be sure to choose glides of the same diameter as the walker tubing usually 1”).a hemi walker is designed for people who only have the use of one hand or arm. it&rsquos lighter than a walker yet more stable than a cane and should be made to fold easily with one hand.other specialty walkers include the uprise walker and assist a combination of a folding walker and rising aid. secondary handles provide stable assistance from a seated to a standing position. this particular walker has an onyx finish features a single release folding mechanism and is designed for people with limited hand dexterity. it can also be used as a portable toilet safety frame.an attachment that offers a feature usually seen on a rollator is the walker rest seat. it provides a comfortable fold-down padded seat when you become tired and need to rest. the 2” foam padded vinyl cover can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth and the plywood base has wood frame supports. two hook and loop fastener straps secure the seat to the uprights or horizontal rails. view more recently viewed about parentgiving are
