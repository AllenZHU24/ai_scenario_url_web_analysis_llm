buyer guides buyer guides » walkers choosing the best walkers walkers are mobility aids for people who need help with balance and more support than a cane provides, but aren’t suited to the faster pace of a rollator, which requires hand strength to work the brakes and the ability of your legs to keep up. walkers call for some degree of upper body strength because you place more weight on your arms as you lift the aid up and down a step ahead of you, instead of pushing it forward. the standard walker design has four legs and a light metal frame. some models offer color choices to make the walker more stylish. putting glides on the leg tips will allow the walker to move more smoothly. as its name indicates, front wheel walkers have wheels instead of tips on the front two legs. wheels in front eliminate the need to pick up the walker to advance it and make for smoother, easy movement. again, glides can be put on the rear leg glides to make maneuvering even smoother (be sure to choose glides of the same diameter as the walker tubing, usually 1”). a hemi walker is designed for people who only have the use of one hand or arm. it’s lighter than a walker yet more stable than a cane and should be made to fold easily with one hand. other specialty walkers include the uprise walker and assist, a combination of a folding walker and rising aid. secondary handles provide stable assistance from a seated to a standing position. this particular walker has an onyx finish, features a single release folding mechanism and is designed for people with limited hand dexterity. it can also be used as a portable toilet safety frame. an attachment that offers a feature usually seen on a rollator is the walker rest seat. it provides a comfortable, fold-down padded seat when you become tired and need to rest. the 2” foam padded vinyl cover can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth, and the plywood base has wood frame supports. two hook and loop fastener straps secure the seat to the uprights or horizontal rails. walker considerations consider your personal needs and the features that will best satisfy them when choosing a walker: adjustable height: the floor-to-handle height should adjust to your height to ensure that you will be properly positioned when walking. note: when handle height is properly set, your elbows should be slightly bent. to find the best floor-to-handle height measurement for you, stand straight with your arms at your sides and have someone measure the distance from your wrist to the ground. weight support: check to be certain that the walker is a match for your weight. most standard designs accommodate users up to 250 or 300 lb. bariatric models are made for people who weigh more. easy folding: if you don’t need the walker at the ready at all times, look for a design that folds up. this is also important if you travel or ride in vehicles and want to take your walker with you to your destination. note the mechanism that walkers you’re interested in use for folding to decide if you can easilyoperate it. the fixed wheel dual paddle folding walker with glides by carex [link to :
