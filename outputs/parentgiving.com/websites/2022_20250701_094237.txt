extension 3-position lift chairs it is hard to beat a recliner when it comes to overall comfort. you can sit with your feet on the floor, recline to read or watch television, or even recline all the way to a sleeping position. if you have difficulty getting up from a seated position or lowering yourself safely to a seat, however, you may not be able to enjoy a standard recliner. the solution? a 3-position lift chair recliner (often referred to as a 3-way recliner) that allows the user to recline comfortably into a sleeping position, a tv recline position and a standard straight position. the back and ottoman of a 3-position chair operate in tandem (i.e., the backrest reclines as the footrest raises) and both are controlled by a handheld remote — perfect for people of medium to large build. if you enjoy the support that a recliner provides, but find it difficult or impossible to sit down or stand up without assistance, 3-position riser chairs are an ideal option. if you’re looking for the best three-position lift chairs, check out our selection. you’ll enjoy the comfort and convenience of a standard recliner that’s designed with your safety and ease in mind. all products top
