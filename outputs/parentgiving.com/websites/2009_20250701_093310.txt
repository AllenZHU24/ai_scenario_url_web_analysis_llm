its contoured handle offers comfort and stability and its smaller size makes it a great choice for the smaller hand. today's colorful designs mean that a patterned cane can be a stylish accessory. a folding travel cane makes for easy packing when a cane isn't needed at all times; some styles are adjustable. for non-curved canes, an attached strap allows the user to keep a hold on the cane yet have both hands free. this wrist strap can come as an accessory as well. other cane accessories include an ice grip attachment to prevent falls and a cane holder. attaching a cane base allows it to become self-standing when not in use, as well as adding a measure of stability. variations include the seat cane, great for people who might need to rest while on a walk or if waiting for a bus, for example. choose from three-leg seat cane and four-leg seat cane styles walkers: security & ease of movement walkers come in many styles; the most basic walker is an aluminum folding walker. a walker with easy-release levers makes folding easier for people with arthritis or limited dexterity. for people with the use of only one hand, a hemi walker can facilitate walking. the bariatric rollator is designed to provide support for up to 400 pounds. a rollator is a product that has wheels to provide movement, so there is less strain required from the user. if the user prefers a walker but is not strong enough to lift and move it along in front of them, or simply wants better ease of movement, walker wheels can be added to the front of the walker, with gliders to reduce drag on the rear legs. longer ski glides, textured glides or, for even less drag and more fluidity, court side glides ease movement when placed on the rear legs of a fixed wheel walker. make carrying necessities easier with a basket attachment, a front pouch, a side-attaching pouch, or a walker hook for holding a purse or shopping bag. scooters & wheelchairs: durability & safety scooters and wheelchairs are most practical for those users who are unable to use a walker or rollator. sometimes they also work as a nice complement to those products if a user does not want to be on their feet all day. the scooters come in various styles, including different colors and three and four wheel varieties. there are also numerous accessories for wheelchairs, such as cushions and leg rests. © copyright 2009 parentgiving, inc.all rights reserved. all content on parentgiving.com, including articles, newsletters, and news, is for information only and not intended to diagnose, treat or advise on medical, health, legal, financial or other issues. see additional information. use of this website is subject to our terms of use and privacy policy. about sitemap contact us order status shipping return policy privacy policy terms and conditions become a supplier
