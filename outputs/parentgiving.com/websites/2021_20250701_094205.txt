parentgiving picks value tape-on briefs tape-on style briefs are the incontinence product type of choice for many professional caregivers who perform frequent changes and who demand an easy-on and easy-off product. this style is also relevant for loved ones in assisted living, where changes are frequent and where it is imperative to keep costs down.adjustable tabs allow caregivers to secure the product as needed and make for easy removal. some people prefer tape-on briefs because they can better adjust the fit to their own measurements. this customization reduces gapping and sagging for secure comfort and better leakage control. look for oversized, front-closing adhesive tabs and stretchy side panels for added comfort. leg elastics enhance both the fit and the leakage protection, and a cloth-like outer cover creates a more discreet product. some tab style briefs have an extremely high capacity for better protection and fewer changes, plus a color indicator to help caregivers know when a change is needed. these are our new and updated parentgiving picks for best value tape-on briefs: starting at: $29.99$1.07each tena stretch super briefs for both men and womenthis adult garment
