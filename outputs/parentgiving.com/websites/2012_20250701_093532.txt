a floor trapeze won't work with a platform bed for instance. floor trapeze styles can handle a lot of weight. the bariatric free standing trapeze has a 1000 lb capacity and an easy to assemble, tool-free design. the chain is adjustable from edge of headboard to the end of boom by sliding it to desired position. showing page 1 out of 1 pages sort by: sort by name a-z sort by name z-a sort by price low to high sort by price high to low sort by sale high to low sort by sale low to high sort by rating high to low sort by rating low to high related buyer guides: choosing the best trapeze bars and bed trapezes choosing the best bedding bed trapezes are designed to assist those dealing with limited or waning physical mobility at getting in and out of bed, changing positions or rolling over. a hanging bar above the bed gives patients and seniors something strong to hold onto that gives them the leverage and swivel needed to roll, rise or lower. we carry trapeze models that can be mounted from the ceiling, wall or from a floor stand, by the top trusted brands in medical equipment like lumex, e2, versa-helper and superpole with supertrapeze. a variety of options means the perfect fit for any particular lifestyle. a popular heavy duty option is the lumex bariatric trapeze, which supports up to 450 pounds and helps the person move safely from the bed to other equipment like wheelchairs or commodes with minimal effort or assistance. regain your independence and get the trapeze you've been dreaming of since first visiting the circus as a child. just that this one's all about safety... about us advertise with us buyer guides caregiver resources contact us coupons gift certificates institutional sales order status partner with us press room privacy policy return policy rewards program shipping sitemap terms of use volume discounts © copyright 2012 parentgiving, inc.  all rights reserved. all content on parentgiving.com, including articles, newsletters, and news, is for information only and not intended to diagnose, treat or advise on medical, health, legal, financial or other issues. see additional information. use of this website is subject to our terms of use and privacy policy.
