nuvi 2350lmt 4.3" gps navigator w/ lifetime traffic & map updates:i normally don't write reviews, but this one is so bad that i have to spread the word. when you make a turn, car on the screen spins and completely loose the direction. i used it in downtown chicago and milwaukee and finally gave-up after going back and forth. my old nuvi works a lot better than this. i bought this one for my wife but now she wants to use the old one. i really want to return this unit but it's past 2 months now. i will never buy garmin again.how are you with directions:great w/directionswas this a

traffic & map updates:this is an upgrade from my previous garmin 255w. i have used this gps on a few road trips. apart from the slow overnight map update, this gps has it all: free lifetime map update, u-turn command, lane change, toll-avoidance, and will remember your own route (after a while). other cons about this gps is that the voice sounds digital, but switching to default improves that somewhat. it also does not offer compass on the map to tell you which direction you're going.how are you with directions:great w/directionswas this a gift?:nobottom line yes, i would recommend
