(for example our open-box merchandise which we sell at closeout prices.) back to top q: may i take advantage of a manufacturer mail-in rebate through beachcamera? a: for your convenience, beachcamera advertises current manufacturer rebates on our website. that being said, manufacturer mail-in rebate offers are fulfilled by the manufacturer exclusively. the prices on our website do not include mail-in rebate savings. use of these rebates is limited to any terms or conditions provided by the manufacturer. if you have any questions regarding a rebate's terms & conditions and/or how to redeem the rebate, please contact the manufacturer directly. q: do open box items qualify for rebate offers? a: no, we do not offer (or honor) rebates for open box items. a rebate offer for a new product will not be honored for a open box unit of the same product. q: how do i change the quantity or remove an item from my basket? a: to change the quantity of any item in your shopping cart, change the number entered in the quantity box and then hit the "update order" button located beneath the last item in your cart. to remove an item from your cart, click on the "x" button located to the right of the item's quantity. q: how are the memory cards you list on your site different in speed? a: memory cards speeds info: - 133x, 200x, 300x - 20mb/s, 30mb/s, 45mb/s - class 2,4 or,6 there are different speed grades available which are measured with the same system as cd-roms, in multiples of 150 kb/s (1x = 150 kb/s). basic cards transfer data up to six times (6x) the data rate of the standard cd-rom speed (900 kb/s vs. 150 kb/s). high-speed cards are made with higher data transfer rates like 66x (10 mb/s), and high-end cards have speeds of 200x or higher. note that maximum read speed and maximum write speed may be different, with maximum write speed typically lower than maximum read speed. some digital cameras require high-speed cards (write speed) to record video smoothly or capture multiple still photographs in rapid succession. the sd card specification 1.01 allows for a maximum speed of 66x. higher speeds of up to 200x are defined by specification 2.0. rating= speed (mb/s) (maximum speeds) - 6x = 0.9 - 32x = 4.8 - 40x = 6.0 - 66x = 10.0 - 100x = 15.0 - 133x = 20.0 - 150x = 22.5 - 200x = 30.0 - 300x =45.0 sd speed class ratings (minimum speeds) sdhc cards have sd speed class ratings defined by the sd association. the sd speed class ratings specify the following minimum write speeds based on "the best fragmented state where no memory unit is occupied" - class 2 = 2 mb/s - class 4= 4 mb/s - class 6= 6 mb/s sdhc cards will often also advertise a maximum speed (such as 133x or 150x) in addition to this minimum speed class rating. see section speeds above for a further explanation. one critical difference between the speed class and the maximum speed ratings is the ability of the host device to query the sd card for the speed class and determine the best location to store data that meets the performance required. "maximum speed" ratings are quoted by the manufacturers but unverified by any independent evaluation process. q: how do i change my login id and/or password? a: to change your login or password, click on "my account" located on top right of every page on our site. login using your existing login and password. once you get to your profile page, click on the large "edit" button. you may then choose to change your login, your password or both. back to top q: i am experiencing some trouble with my shopping cart. what might be wrong? a: shopping cart problems usually occur from one or more of the following reasons: cookies are not enabled the master clock on the computer is not set correctly the terminal you are using is behind a firewall. you are using a browser less than internet explorer 5.1. some people have trouble when using any netscape browser. if all else fails, try closing all programs, restart your computer or email us at customerservice@beachcamera.com q: i'm sure i've registered before with beach camera's site; but when i try to log in, i'm denied access. what could cause this? a: if you are sure you have already registered with our site, then the username and password you are entering do not exactly match. there may be a slight spelling error in one of them. you can easily register a new username and password by clicking on the "order now" button next to any product.
