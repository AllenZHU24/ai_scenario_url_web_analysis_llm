will you get exactly what you ordered with all included manufacturer accessories? will you get support if you have a problem after the sale? will the manufacturer honor your warranty? will the company you purchased from be in business for the foreseeable future? manufacturers are very strict about whom they authorize to be dealers. not everyone qualifies. is trained by the manufacturer to be knowledgeable about the products sold and can share that expertise with you. has the full support of the manufacturer and will help you if your merchandise is defective. buys directly from manufacturers and stocks the products you are looking to purchase in its own warehouse. is rigorously examined by the manufacturer prior to authorization. ensures that manufacturer warranties will be honored. online and mail-order purchases are an incredibly convenient and wonderful way to find the products you need at prices you can afford. protect yourself and avoid unnecessary hassle by knowing who you are purchasing from - because it makes all the difference! featured brand new releases news & information clearance hdtvs beach camera store alerts & savings sign up for beach camera news, updates, deals, and promotions. twitter feed my account customer service contact us f.a.q. policies mobile website coupons shop by brand new releases rebates review us testimonials about us our blog sign up for buydig.com coupons and special offers thanks for signing up! by search email address ssl © 1996-2015 beachcamera.com.  all rights reserved. beachcamera.com is a registered trademark.
