v apr 03, 2025 introducing the canon eos r50 v photographers and videographers can enjoy canon’s newest addition to their eos with the aps-c sensor canon eos r50 v. this builds on the already popular canon eos r50 and is available for pre-order now. this camera is great for vlogging and can create content that provides amazing image quality on this canon eos r series camera. the canon eos r50 v comes with many amazing specs and features photographers have come to expect from canon cameras. in addition to the enhanced image quality over previous generation models, the video features which allow vloggers and content creators to get amazing video recordings that show off the versatility and capability of this camera on social media. utilizing the canon camera connect app which can be found in the apple ios appstore, and the android google play store allows you to utilize one of the multitude of connections, a usb cable to the usb-c port on the camera, or the included wi-fi and bluetooth if you are pairing your camera with your smartphone. the app will also prompt you when a firmware update is available. typically, you want to process any firmware updates prior to first using the camera, this ensures that your new canon eos r camera is up to date with all the newest features, bug fixes and capabilities of the camera. in addition, to finding the usual fare that you might expect on a dslr mirrorless camera such as a touchscreen lcd viewfinder or evf, tremendous image stabilization which we will delve into further in more detail, this is also known as an interchangeable lens camera. which means that you can purchase the camera with an included prime lens or get a different canon rf lens that meets the canon rf mount for lenses. remember, if you are purchasing a lens from a different manufacturer such as sony or nikon that may use a different lens mount than a mounting adapter would be required. let’s examine some of the features and specs of the canon eos r50v and show why this is a wonderful camera for all of you vloggers and content creators out there. canon did a nice job in upgrading and progressing this camera from previous iterations and competitors like the nikon zv-e10 or sony mark ii cameras. general features get to photographing the canon eos r50v comes stock full of features which will assist you greatly in your current role as a vlogger conducting livestreams, and help you progress in your career getting amazing creative content onto your social media site. you can use this camera to assist you in having a successful career in vlogging. with its powerful aps-c sensor getting you approximately 24.2 megapixels in your exposures. this ensures tremendous clarity and color vibrancy on each pixel in your viewing scene. the aps-c sensor coupled with a digic x image processor allows you the ability to achieve cropped 4k video or oversample from 6k at a frame rate of 60 fps. full hd or 1920 x 1080p recording can get you a frame rate of 120 fps. so, there are plenty of options if you choose to record in 4k or full hd. remember the higher quality you record your exposures in will take up more space on your camera. this camera comes with one memory card slot rated for sd cards at uhs ii. an sd card with more than 512 gb of space is not recommended, therefore we strongly suggest purchasing a secondary card for several reasons. first off, you may need more space than 512 gb provides and the last thing you want to have happen is to run out of storage space right in the middle of a vlog. the other important reason is that even high-end sd cards could be prone to failure and over time may become difficult for your camera or your pc to get information from the card. therefore, you should always have at least one back up sd card. there are very affordable fast read/write options for sd cards from manufacturers like lexar, sandisk and western digital amongst others. for a video camera you get an all-new dual pixel cmos af ii tracking that contains advanced subject detection including people, animals and automobiles. this camera utilizes canon log3 which is a video used to get a wider dynamic range. the reason for doing this is that your image retains more detail in shadows and bright lights, which makes editing in post-production easier as more options are opened to you. think of this as shooting in prores for example without as much detailing options. thankfully as this is a canon interchangeable lens camera where you can purchase the body only if you choose, the camera supports canon cinema eos, which is the amazing autofocus system of canon cameras. since image stabilization is not supported by the camera and it relies on the lens’ optical is found with the stm pz lens which is included in the non-body only option. stabilization during photographing is so important as we often see blur and shake associated with handheld shooting. therefore, even with the lens supported image stabilization we highly recommend investing in a tripod mount for your camera to ensure an even more stable photography session. plus getting the right tripod mount will allow you to alter the shooting angle of your camera with ease. additional important general tech specs this camera comes with the canon rf-s14 with a focal range of 14mm-30mm which is a compact, ultra-wide zoom lens with a power zoom mechanism found on the mode dial. also found with the mode dial is an easy record button which activates the electronic shutter to capture the image based on the aperture, iso, white balance, focal length and all the settings which may have been automatically set in autofocus mode or if you chose manual mode. these are all found on some of canon’s great vlogging cameras like powershot v1. having this camera and the canon powershot v1 in your photography stable will surely help you with any shooting environment you may encounter. we highly recommend giving shooting in manual mode a go. this will give you intricate control over the in-camera settings such as the prior mentioned aperture opening, iso number, white balance and other settings. as you continue to practice with these settings in different lighting conditions, your skill set as a photographer and videographer will improve thus as a result so will your vlogs. connectivity/power connectivity on the canon eos r is plentiful with a high-speed usb-c port to power the camera while in use, there is wi-fi ac or wi-fi 5 included as well as the slower yet longer range wi-fi 4 or wi-fi 2.4 ghz with wi-fi 5 you get faster speeds by being able to access the 5ghz bands of the wi-fi spectrum for faster upload and download speeds. so, you can get your photographs and images onto your social media page in a breeze. there is also a micro-hdmi, so you can easily connect your camera directly to a monitor or even a large tv and show off those gorgeous 4k images. the camera is powered by a lp-e17 battery which is lithium ion and can be charged via the ac brick or the usb-c port. recording times for photography and videos will vary depending on the size of the file. for example, the battery can handle less than 4k oversampled videos from 6k than standard 4k or full hd recording. the user manual has all the detailed recording available times (which will also depend on the type and rating of the sd card that you are using). should you get the canon eos r50 v? /availability if you own a previous iteration of the canon eos r camera, with the specs such as the advanced subject tracking, the powerful aps-c digicx image sensor some of the boons of the higher end of the v series, an upgrade is warranted. not just that but you can attach bluetooth headphones (or wired ones) if you choose which will allow you to hear and speak during your vlog session. so, if you are a vlogger or a content creator, don’t hesitate and pre-order this camera now which will be available for shipping in
