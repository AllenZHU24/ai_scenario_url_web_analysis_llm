please check back for updated information on website specifics. shipping questions how do you ship items? we ship wheel only purchases via ups or fedex (and in some instances, for very large sizes, via freight truck), insured and traceable. complete packages are shipped via freight truck via various carriers; you will be provided tracking information as well. in many instances, shipments are billed out before the items are ready to ship, so please allow up to 1-2 business days (in many cases less time) for wheel only purchases, or up to a few business days for complete packages. freight shipments require a delivery appointment. the freight company will schedule that with you before any delivery attempt is made. if you are unsure or have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask any questions regarding delivery of your purchase. do you ship internationally? we ship all over the world at very competitive rates. please note that pricing on the website does not include shipping costs beyond the us lower 48 states (not including alaska nor hawaii). we will be happy to run a rate for you. keep in mind, our rates are for freight only, and will not include any additional fees (such as brokerage, duties, etc). i have not received a tracking number for my purchase. when can i expect to receive my tracking number? tracking numbers are typically emailed 24-48 business hours, after an order is placed. we will email you your tracking number once the order has been processed. during peak order times, please allow additional time for details to be emailed out. i received my tracking number for my purchase but it is not showing movement. we typically bill out orders in advance of them being shipped out so it is common that you will receive your tracking number before an item ships out. wheels alone typically ship out within 1-2 business days while a complete package can take longer due to the custom nature of the product. once a freight item has shipped, please allow up to 24 hours for the shipping company’s website to update/reflect movement (they are not as instant as ups or fedex in shipping events). i have never received a freight shipment. what can i expect on delivery? complete wheel and tire packages are shipped via freight to prevent any damages and to help keep our costs low. once you receive your tracking number and track the item on the shipper’s website, we recommend you reach out to the shipping company to schedule an appointment for delivery based on the expected delivery date (freight shipments will not deliver without one), to help speed up the order process. otherwise, the shipping company will contact you to schedule delivery, typically once it reaches the delivery terminal. please note that it is common for multiple freight companies to move the items at different points once in route to your door. order issue questions i am having an issue pairing my tpms, how do i sync them to my vehicle? while some tpms have an auto-relearn feature to facilitate pairing, most must be synced to the vehicle. we will be happy to provide you with specific instructions for your year, make and model. in some cases, it is as easy as airing down the tire, waiting a few minutes, and re-airing it back up. i installed my wheels and tires and i encounter vibration on driving. how do i address and fix this situation? after the first 50 miles of driving on new wheels and tires, the lug nuts need to be retorqued, and this should solve almost all instances of vibration. if there is still some vibration, you may need to purchase and install hub rings, depending on the wheel. in all cases, we do recommend an alignment being performed after the installation of any new wheels and tires as well. i purchased items online and they went on back order. what can i do? we try our very best to ensure that each item up for sale is made available. in rare instances, beyond our control, items do go on back order from time to time. if that does happen, we will reach out to you to try and broker a solution (typically suggest an alternate wheel that is available, or perhaps keeping you updated via email until it becomes available). please keep in mind, you have the option to cancel an order if we are unable to reach a solution. my items arrived and they do not fit. what are my options? for all wheel or tire purchases, we recommend a test fit before any installation or driving on the product to ensure an item can be returned. if it is determined that sd wheel is at fault and recommended something that would not work, sd wheel will pay to have the situation resolved. if a customer requested a certain item that is beyond the vehicle specs or sizing and there is an issue, sd wheel will not cover any costs to resolve the issue. please call or email us and our knowledgeable staff can walk you through correcting the situation. my items arrived damaged. what should i do? in rare instances that an item arrives damaged, we require you to contact us immediately so we can document the situation. in all instances, you should make note of damages with the shipper when you accept the goods. if an item is signed off without damage noted, damage claims may be denied and we may be unable to replace product. my items arrived but it is incorrect. what should i do?
