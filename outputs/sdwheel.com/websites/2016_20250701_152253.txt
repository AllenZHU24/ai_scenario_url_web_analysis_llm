both wheel manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers provide us with extensive information regarding individual fitments. we will provide you with our best recommendation and do ask that all wheels be test fit prior to being mounted on tires (for wheel only purchases), or driven on (for wheel and tire packages) please provide us with your year, make and model. in some rare instances, or with certain modifications, we are unable to provide a definitive answer. what is pcd? how will i know which to select for my vehicle? pcd is another way of classifying the bolt pattern for the wheel. each vehicle has a unique bolt pattern. in some cases, a wheel is dual drilled, meaning 2 sets of holes are present on the wheel. please make sure to line up the correct pattern for your individual application. what does blank mean under pcd? a blank wheel is one that is not drilled at the factory to an individual bolt pattern (provided the mounting pad is large enough to fit that application). a wheel is drilled to order, and typically used to either fulfill uncommon vehicle applications, or to minimize different products on the shelf. for wheels drilled from blanks, please allow additional time to process and complete the order, and in some cases, drilling fees are not included in the cost of the wheel. if you are unsure, please do not hesitate to ask. due to liability issues, customers cannot purchase a blank wheel without it being drilled with the respective wheel manufacturer. what is the pcd or boltpattern of my car? they vary from vehicle to vehicle please use the email box below to ask. please include the year make and model. what is offset? the offset of a wheel is the distance from the mounting pad to the centerline of the wheel. an offset can be positive, with the mounting pad in front of the centerline of the wheel; zero, with the centerline in line with the mounting pad; or negative, with the mounting pad behind the centerline of the wheel. positive offset wheels are typically found on front wheel drive vehicles, and newer rear wheel drive vehicles; negative offset wheels are typically found on wheels for lifted applications, or older, rear wheel drive vehicles. what is the backspace of the wheel? how is this different from the offset? backspacing is similar to offset and would be the distance (in inches) from the mounting pad to the inside lip of the wheel. tire questions how will i know which tire size to select? based on your year, make and model, and any applicable modifications (such as lift/level, or lowering kit), we can make a tire recommendation for you. if you are unsure about a tire size, please do not hesitate to ask. what do the numbers represent in metric tire sizing? example size: 305-55r20 metric tire sizing is determined by 3 different numbers. the first number represents the width, in millimeters. the second number is the aspect ratio, meaning the side wall height is that percentage of the width (in this case, the side wall height is 55% of its width, 305). the final number represents the wheel diameter, in inches. what do the numbers represent in a floatation size tire? example size: 35x12.50r20 floatation size tires are represented by 3 different numbers. the first represents the overall tire diameter (in inches). the second represents the overall width (in inches). the final represents the wheel diameter used to mount to the tire. accessory questions do i need aftermarket lug nuts with my new wheels? yes. almost all aftermarket wheels have smaller lug holes than the factory wheels. in most cases they wont even fit in the holes. aftermarket tapered lugs are also required to center the wheel to the hub. are any of these wheels hub centric? do i need hub centric rings to make my wheels center on my car? some wheels are made to be hub centric please ask below to see if with most aftermarket wheels and lugs hubcentric rings are not required. the majority of aftermarket wheels and lugs are tapered. when tightened in the above sequence per your lug pattern the wheels will center themselves. will my vehicle require tpms installed? most 2002 and newer vehicles have tire pressure monitoring systems (tpms). if your vehicle requires these sensors (please ask if you are unsure), we will install them for free on a complete wheel and tire package when purchased from us. please note that some vehicle models or sensors may require a re-programming process to sync with the new sensors. thais can be done fairly easily by an auto dealer or repair shop. will my order include center caps? if the wheel is made with a center cap, they would be included in the purchase. please note that standard caps are only included with any applicable purchase. some vehicles may require a taller center cap, or an open cap to accommodate vehicle hubs/axles. please feel free to ask if those may be need for your vehicle, and we would be happy to price those out. order/package questions do your products come with a warranty? all wheels come with a lifetime structural warranty, as well as a finish warranty (90 days to up to 2 years, depending on the specific brand). tires come with a structural warranty, and depending on the tire, may come with a treadwear warranty as well. we do not offer, and products do not include, a road hazard warranty. what is your return policy? we issue full refunds, less shipping, on wheels returned in the condition in which they were received, subject to a restocking fee. some manufacturers charge restocking fees up to 20%, which may apply to this purchase. wheel only purchases must be unmounted, brand new, and in factory boxes. wheel and tire packages must not have been installed or driven on. anything returned that is not in the aforementioned condition will be subject to refusal or a restocking fee of up to 20%. all wheel and tire packages returned are subject to the 20% restocking fee. how long can i return an item? we allow up to a 30-day return period (dependent on what type of order), and all returns must be approved, and rga# provided before any returns will be accepted (though fees may apply, such as shipping costs and or a restocking fee). failure to do so may result in delays in processing the return, or rejection of returned goods. customer support will you look forward to the time, when your vehicle needs attention? take a deep breath and go for protecting your vehicle and in return you will get the same from your vehicle. since 2003, sd wheel corporation is offering the best-in-class automotive wheel and tire packages within your means. navigation home about us wheels tires lugs tmps gallery catalogue affiliate contact us follow us call us toll free 1-800-317-0483 contact us 620 stetson ave st charles, il 60174 800 317 0483 sales@sdwheelcorp.com newsletter copyright © 2016 sdwheel metalic.com. all rights reserved.
