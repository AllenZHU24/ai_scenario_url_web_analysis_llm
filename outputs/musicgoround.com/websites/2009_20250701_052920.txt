i spend a lot of time browsing musician's friend and guitar center for a good amp at a good price, having thought i had found the one i wanted, i found out it was a one channel peavey windsor half stack. i was going to buy it, but decided to browse music go round instead and found a line 6 spider iii hd150 half stack for $399, about $100 less than the peavey. i was convinced something had to be wrong with the equipment, but it worked beautifully, and it is now my amp when i jam out. thanks, music go round! -gabe, new mexico i grew up with rogers drums, had an aunt that worked at both the covington, oh and fullerton ca, factories. i sold my last rogers set in 1980, when i needed rent money. the company went out of business, i got married, bought other drums and kept playing. i really missed those old rogers though. about 10 years ago, every time i would go into a music store i would ask about them. then about 6 years ago, i walked into the louisville music go round, and there it was, the exact same model of set i used to have! when i saw the rogers logo i ran out of the store in tears. it took me a minute to compose myself, then i went back in where my stunned wife was waiting. we bought that set the next day. since then i've added a few more music go round goodies, like an acrolite snare, a couple of odds and ends, and now do clinics playing actual melodic songs on a tuned set. thank you music go round! -jim, kentucky what a great line of stores. i have ordered a couple of items through them using the internet and they were great in shipping the items quick. keep up the great work and i will keep spending my hard earned cash at music go round. great prices too. -kirk, il last year when my husband was trying to sell his classical guitar we went to many different music stores in the raleigh area. it was during this time that i got interested in playing the bass. i have never played anything before. i ended up getting my bass from music go round with a case and small practice amp. i have since been receiving lessons & my husband got a new guitar from there as well. i recommend this location to everyone!! there are several big company music stores in the area but we never go to them anymore. cary music go round rocks!! everyone is always nice upfront and honest and i would never go to anyone else. -jenny, nc i got my first squier at my local music go round. after that,i fell in love with guitar playing. they have had some incredible gear for musicians such as myself that are on a budget, but still want high quality equipment. i now own an esp alexi-sythe, an ltd f-250,a schecter omen-7,and a peavey vyper 120 and 9 pedals all from music go round. -steve, pa it was a couple of months ago, two days before school started, and i was in chicago. i was there for a scorpions concert, it was amazing. my dad went to high school with the drummer james kottak and we go backstage passes any everything. we got to go on stage, and he showed us his drum set and it was amazing. right then and there i knew exactly i wanted i wanted to do with my life. i wanted to be a drummer, so that's what i did. i found this guy that worked with my dad at nortan hospital that plays the drums, and so a couple month's later i'm a drummer, and right now i have a 2009 pearl forum 5 piece. -chad, kentucky i was 13 i started playing a first act me501 for 4 years but on my 14th birthday it was a sunday i went to this music store a-major music all they had was ibanez guitars but i wanted something even better than that. luckily a music go round in kenosha was open and i walked inside and fell in love with all the guitars that i saw. i looked at a bunch of rhodes models then the dean ml's the v guitars and settled on a jackson kelly, and best of all it was very affordable. a 14 year old kids dream of having one came true thanks to music go round for making a dream come true. if you live near the kenosha, stop in u wont regret it. -ken, illinois music go round desn't just have the same five guitars the other stores carry - you can usually find something unique (and inexpensive) & if that doesn't work for your needs, they'll buy it back. (plus, where else can you buy and e string on sunday??) -jarvis, houston, tx being for the most part a self-taught guitarist, music go round was one of my biggest influences & pushes to stick wtih practicing, even though i was not very "good" right away. in addition to the extremely helpful staff at the kenosha store, which i found to be rather uncommon at other stores. ohh and music go round supplied me with my first amp! -devin, wi when i was about 15 i got a few guitars passed down to me by my grandfather. i have been playing for about a years now and began knowing nothing. never had time nor money for guitar lessons. the electric is a 1989 swg stinger, the acoustic is an indiana, not sure of the year but im in the market for a new guitar finally and i am beginning to write my own music and it has never been better. i will be checking out music go round. -tyler, pennsylvania well when i was about 13 or 14 i was told by a friend that there was a website for used guitars. so i checked it out. i found a mexican fender p-bass with the hardshell case for $280 bucks. the baby was mint. i played it for 3 years. then i was checking out the store listings and i saw that there was a store opening in maple grove. living in elk river, that was a heck of a lot closer than the other stores. so i went the first week it was open. i ended up buying an 80's mesa mark 412. the one with the black shadows and evs. killer cab, wish i would have never sold it. i then started bugging the owner of the store to hire me. after a year and a half and $12,000 worth of gear bought i had a job. i worked there for about a year and a half. i still visit the store often and shop there all the time, recently buying a mid 70's slingerland concert set and putting bottom hoops on it. i am around $15,000 i think now and i don't plan on stopping any time soon. i love music go round! -kyle, minnesota music go round has a great selection of new and used equipment. everything is priced to move, and i always feel like i've never spent too much! plus music go round has the frendliest staff out of all of the music stores that i have visited. -tim, minnesota whenever i need something unique for my band i stop at music go round first. if anyone has what i need they would. at an affordable price! okay, they up with my crazy personality too! -carl, wi if you are either shopping seriously for any instrument, just looking around, need advice/repair, lessons or anything else- no other musical instrument retailer in the area (furthermore the us) is as helpful, knowledgeable and just down right fun. this is from over 25 years of visiting every known dealer from here in pheonix, az. if you are doubting my claimes ask my physician. -brandon, az being for the most part a self taught guitarist, music go round was one of my biggest influences & pushes to stick with practicing, even though i was not "good" right away. in addition to the extremely helpful staff, which i have found to be rather uncommon in other stores... music go round supplied me with my first amp! -bearach, iowa i've been a loyal music go round customer ever since i was a child. despite first entering the store at the tender age of 12, i am able to recall every detail of my first visit to the store. this place put will wonka to shame it was amazing! my anxiety quickly found its end as the manager pointed out a guitar on the wall. a washburn six-string, which looked like it could've been straight from a motley crew music video, found its way into my hands. i left the store with a grin from ear-to-ear; the same grin i make whenever i leave music go round to this day! -marissa, nc privacy policy | return policy | shipping policy | conditions of use | contact us | site map | winmark business solutions music go round® is a registered trademark of winmark corporation® based in minneapolis, mn. each franchise is independently owned and operated. other brand names are trademarked or registered by their respective companies. the trademarks and logos utilized in this website are owned by winmark corporation® and any unauthorized use of these trademarks by others is subject to action under federal and state trademark laws.
