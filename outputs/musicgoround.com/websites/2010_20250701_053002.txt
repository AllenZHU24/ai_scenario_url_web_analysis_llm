i ordered a cort guitar over the phone for my son for christmas from online at the cary, nc store and jeff was so polite and helpful. he packaged the guitar and sent it immediately. it came in wonderful condition, and my 21 year old son absolutely loves it!!! the only problem is getting him to keep his hands off until christmas. i'll have to hide it. great quality, great service and a great price. thank you! jeff was wonderful to deal with and everything was professionally done. will definitely buy more items from music go round in north carolina. great job! -sophie, florida one day i walked into a music go round for the very first time, knowing that a willis music that has to many over-priced items was right down the road and i had always gone there before i had heard of mgr. i walked in there expecting to look for a 18" sabian aa crash or ride. instead as i was walking out a tama, rockstar snare drum caught my eye and i thought it was the best thing i had ever seen. it was only 60 bucks! a deal i couldn't pass up. i bought it and when i got home o put it on my snare stand and threw my crappy excel drum to the side and played for hours. this snare drum wasn't comparing to my excel kit which only cost me 80 bucks. it sounds so good it blows me away. now instead of going to any other music shop i've been to that same mgr 3 times in the past week i just went there today and bought a remo clear diplomat drum head and it sounds like the heavens. now i'm never going to buy from any other music store. -nic, kentucky after learning guitar on my own with equipment that i purchased from music go round in duluth mn, i decided to trade-up my little 15watt vox 15r pathfinder amp. so, i traveled the 65 miles to duluth and the usual sales staff were excellent again to me. this time they gave me sage advice on guitar amps. i wanted a tube like sound, or close to it but solid state only. i did not want to have tube maintenance. so the staff helped me find my new used peavey bandit 112 sheffield transtube 80watt amp. that is a very fine sounding amp. i am once again very pleased with music go round's expert and sound advice. it should be no surprise for those folks to see me there at least once a year... hopefully more times ! tom - silver bay, minnesota u.s.a. -tom, minnesota 53 year old machinist in search of a hobby, read in a aarp magazine about a mechanic in same situation , bought an old fender strat and began to pound on it,every where- today he is one of the biggist blues players in memphis. i always liked music, was a jazz keyboardist in school, but life got in the way. as an item on my bucket list, decided to try playing guitar, picked up a mim fender strat, a g-dec jr amp and a 60 something guitar teacher,skipp of milwaukee. am now working on the pentatonic scales and 12 barblues having the time of my life. i might not be no daddy mack orr but for a old guy he's quite an inspiration. fortunately i have a wife who is a blues nut, and zepplin nut with me. -ray, wisconsin hey music go round,was able to find my dream bass rig with you guys. an american made ampeg classic 2-10, and classic 1-15 cabinet in beautiful condition. amazing sound,portability and looks. thank you so much for having such a great selection. -mike, pa i walked into mgr as a guitar noob. all i owned was a kona acoustic, given to me by my grandma. i went to mgr in search of an electric guitar. i originally planned to ask one of the employees about a guitar/amp combo under a certain price, but strayed from it (because i am shy like that). i am sorry to this day that i didn't ask someone. i got a crappy guitar (my own fault), and a decent amp, though for a great price ($30 can't be beaten!). i went back there for a new electric to take the place of my first crappy one, and i could not be more pleased. i am extremely happy with my 1984 memphis lp copy ($130), and my little 10-buck amp. i love it. even though there aren't really any other guitar stores in my area, i would still go to mgr, even if there were other stores. i hope to get my first job there when i am able to. i would love to help out another guitarist like i was. -david, kentucky it goes like this. we travel the country and show up in public parks to educate people about job creation. www.jobcreation.us.  at these parks we invite people to play original music. they rely on the pa system that you sold us. not being a musician your people in wilkes barre sold us the equipment and taught us how to ready ourselves with for the musicians with full directions. it has been a god send. -mark, new york city i have owned an epiphone strat style guitar for over 10 years and love the guitar to death, but due to its age there was a lot going wrong with this guitar. i stopped by my local music go round just to take a look around, and figured i would ask if they could give me a hand replacing some parts on my axe. in a few short days they had replaced my volume and tone potentiometers, and rewired my self-installed kill switch, this guitar is like new again and i cant get over how much better this guitar is now! the tone range is honestly a million times larger now and has allowed me to really dial in the tone i need. great job! -tyler, ma you guys are the best. i got a walden cherry wood acoustic about 1 year back, and its been working ever since. i bought an electric squier strat before that and it was crap. probably because i did'nt buy it from you. i'm going to buy an explorer or sg from you once i get the money. -harrison, michigan whenever i've walked into a local music store, i've walked out disappointed because of 2 things. 1) they usually don't have any sweet gear i'm looking for or would like, and 2) the employees act like they couldn't care less about their customers. on the other hand, whenever i've finally resorted to the internet to find what i need, music go round's site always pops up with the gear i need and at a great price to boot! when i was finally ready to get my fbv shortboard, i was blown away at their customer service. gary was as polite as could be in all communication and did a great job of getting me my new gear asap. i intend to do business with music go round many more times. it's my new favorite music store. thanks gary, and thanks music go round! -kyle, arizona i sold some gear to them a few times and walked away with a fair price. there are a bunch of good guys at music go round. -brandon, nc i've lived my life absolutely obsessed with music. most of my friends growing up played instruments and were in bands, but i could never afford an instrument. after moving down here i decided to swing into music go round near my apartment so i could look at all of the cool instruments i would never be able to afford. little did i know that music go round would have none of that! the entire staff at mgr in cary are *the* best people i have ever met when attempting to make any sort of purchase. i didn't feel pushed in any direction, and they let me choose what i wanted and offered little suggestions along the way to get me going off right. my first time there jeff hooked me up with a schecter damien 6 and all of the fixings. he even played it for me so i could hear it, and helped me understand exactly what i was buying. i went back shortly after to purchase a 7-string and once again i was giving a great deal on an amazing ibanez rg7620rb. kevin even went so far as to scour his personal collection to find me a tremolo for it. talk about going out of your way for someone! i've made it a routine to go back and visit to see how everyone is doing. every time i step into the store they all ask me how i'm doing and how each of my guitars are. i truly feel like a welcomed friend. today i went in just to say "hi" and they happened to have a lot of great deals going on. wouldn't you know that they happened to have an amazing schecter stiletto custom-4 in vampyre red satin, brand new, sitting on the counter! kevin had something in mind for it, and instead offered to send it my way if i wanted. obvious i took it! i really can't express in words how absolutely amazing these guys are. i will *never* purchase any music equipment from anyone else. i am a lifetime mgr customer, and friend! you guys rock! -mike, nc i first discovered music go round in severna park md. now gone. i frequent the monroeville, pa location now. two things that always impressed me at any location i've been too is the 1st the attitude of the many staffs. just a great supportive lot of musicians that have always given outstanding & knowledgeable service. 2'd, when you couple that with the eclectic & varied selection of gear: i'm like a kid in a candy store. m.g.r is a refreshing alternative to the big gear marts i won't mention by name. thanks guys, marvin player -marvin, md. & pa. in 1997 i bought a 1994 klassic 440 amp and years later i got the cab to match...a 1967 kustom by bud 2x15 cab. and during the years i have learned alot about kustom and klassic...where they are the same company just different owners.. all 100% usa -andy, wi the store in woodbury mn. had the drum kit i have been looking for. i had a kit that i wanted to part with so i went there to make that transaction. the guys were great to work with. so much that a couple of weeks later i bought a guitar from them as well. i purchased a used guitar from one other store. it was an on-line purchase but was so easy. showed up three days later. no hassles. i love this store! -ben, wisconsin i was turned on to music go round through some friends of mine here in aurora, co. i have a 1980 g&l series 2 guitar that i needed the neck adjusted. when i came into the store i was greeted by a sales rep asking what he could do for me. i told him what i needed and he said let me take a look. when i pulled the guitar out his eyes lit up and he couldn't believe that i had this guitar. he proceeded to adjust the neck and then asked if he could play it and i said sure.he couldn't believe the sound of the guitar and asked if i wanted to sell it and i said no i have had the guitar since 1981 and have continued to play it since. when he was done i asked how much do i owe you and he said nothing it was a pleasure to play such a classic guitar. i have since gone back and purchased a bass and amp and will soon be purchasing a new dean acoustic/electris guitar. i highly recommend the aurora, co. store to everyone who is a musician or wants to become one. -sylvia, colorado okay heres my story! i have been wanting a jim root fender telecaster signature series for a year now but every time i would check mf, ams, and music123 they would be on backorder. one day on a hunch i was driving past musicgoround in wilkebarre,pa and decided to stop in and there it was in black the guitar i wanted for a year now for $769 musicgoround beat the other companies to the punch because they had it for $700 less then the other places and best of all they had in stock now. better then paying $1499 and waiting to see if i got one or not online. musicgoround is a good place to shop, save serious $$$$$ and get a great instrument in the process. plus the original purchaser never registered it so i got the factory registration with it great deal all around. -justin p, pa after talking myself into another guitar, i decided it should be a mij strat. i had been into the duluth, mn store before, but never with a specific quest. i stopped in with a guitar to trade and a dollar amount in mind that i was willing to pay in addition to walk out with the strat. oddly enough, they had a huge selection, and i found one in, well, literally new condition, not even a scratch on the pick guard, for the price another shop wanted for one in "well used" condition. the trade and $$$ to boot were in line with my expectations. not only that, but eric offered a free set up for the guitar next time i was in the area. (i live 2 hrs away) i called him yesterday, brought the strat by, and for the couple hours i was in town they put new strings on it and gave it a good set up, even dressing the frets as needed! i ended up paying for the strings and no more. that kind of rabid devotion to service after the sale and a satisfied customer at all costs will keep me coming back. funny, when i'm in the shop, he seems to know everyone who comes thru the door on a first name basis. i travel alot for work, and see plenty of pawn shops along the way. if i find a diamond in the rough for re-sale, i'll buy it there. when i'm looking for something for me, the mgr in duluth is my first stop. i know i'll get good advice and a fair deal from eric. -david, mn i had been saving up for a field recorder and i wanted to get the fostex fr-2le. well i was searching on google and it pulled up music go round. i have bought and sold to music go round locally. well i was able to get the fostex fr-2le(very shocked/surprised) from thomas donovan at the music go round in downtown farmington center 23330 farmington road (at grand river ave.) farmington, mi 48336 i got it for an amazing price and it came with a ton of accessories. i was able to use it this weekend on a film shoot and everything worked like a charm. thanks so much for the great deal thomas!! you totally rock. -nicole h, georgia hey, i just got a great deal on a godin detour from you guys. the guitar came double boxed and well packed. the guitar itself and the gig bag are pristine and i got a geat deal. communication was easy and shipping was fast. this is a lot of guitar for the money, and i've had american made gibsons and fenders that i didn't like as much. thank you! dave in sf -dave, ca i've been buying great stuff locally from music go round for years. about two weeks ago, i searched for a piece of gear that i've been looking forever for...typical story. much to my surprise i found one(rane ap13) at your ky store. within less than 24 hours it was at my door step. jason at the ky location did a fantastic job of packing and i still can't believe how fast it arrived. thanks so very much! q.....upright bassplayer for the crown vics and rhythm rockets. -q, illinois well, i got some extra money during christmas, and had some money in my bank account. i needed a drum set since i've been a percussionist since 6th grade, and i'm in jazz band at my school. anyway, i needed a cheap practice set, that could last a while. i only had around $230 to spare (not a lot for a drum set!) anyway, i had bought my beginning percussion kit at music go round in 6th grade, and i knew they had great prices and options. so i went, and a really nice guy helped me out. he looked with me, and he showed a drum set that came with all the drums (5 piece), hi-hats, a crash, bass drum pedal and the rest of the hardware (except crash/ride cymbal stands). so i bought it, along with an almost brand new meinl hcs ride, for $220 flat. also i learned a week later my sunday-school teacher was the owner of this maple grove music go round. go tim huenemann! -mark, minnesota i recently purchased a boss dr-3 drum machine from you guys. i was shocked at how cheap the machine was selling for and i was fully braced to receive a clunker for the cost. after speaking with alex on the phone and via email, i placed my order and received my machine in very little time. it was just as described -- aesthetically a 6, but in use, a 10! great condition and the price was perfect. -will, ma so hereâ€™s the deal. although most of us musicians would like to be making big bucks in some well know act, for most working musicians the pay is minimal and the gigs not so grandiose. unfortunately, we still need quality and dependable gear at a reasonable price, like it set up our way and thatâ€™s exactly what the music go round (mgr) in woodbury, mn helps with. instead of walking into some large chain store with gear stacked up to look cool and a few 13 year olds attempting to have band practice in the guitar section, mgr in woodbury meets the musician at the crossroads of price and functionality. what does this mean using real examples? a complementary tweaking of a guitars action while you wait so the guitar can be used that night, rather than the $95 and have to leave it for two weeks thatâ€™s customary with most places. or how about a guitar tune up including action, intonation and fret work for about $50. one time they even let me try out an amp, at a gig, to make sure it was what i wanted before i paid for it. i just had to share my extremely positive experience with this store. these guys at the woodbury mgr are truly the best. -dean, mn to be honest i have never cared much for music go round. i had a bad dealing with them about 10yrs ago. a few days ago just to kill time i went to the one in lincoln where i live. not expecting to find anything that would catch my eye, i was surprised as hell go find a 1971 airline combo amp that had been totally re-built. the sound was amazing. i have it on lay-away now and i play in a band that performs several times a month locally. i cant wait to get it and play it for the next 40 years of my playing career. thanks music go round and thank you ian for pointing it out to me! go homewreckers and sons of the soil!!!!! -possum, nebraska i had been wanting a fender american mahogany hss strat, but the $1400 price tag put me off. just tooling around one day in my local mgr i laid hands on a godin exit 22 - mahogany body, maple neck, rosewood fingerboard, hss configuration - that not only looked great but had great sounding single coils. with a 15% discount for signing up for the mgr e-mail newsletter and i walked out with the godin for $298 plus sales tax. both the mf and gc price on the exit 22 was $498. after replacing the bridge humbucker, the sound rivaled the mahogany strat but for about $1000 less. -stephen, texas ann,jeff & staff, i was one of the first 25 customers to enter the doors of music go round in lilburn,ga about 10 years ago. i was immediately struck by the honesty & integrity of the owners (ann & jeff). usually, businesses reselling used musical equipment are not the most ethical people you want to meet. i am a drummer and was in the market for a vintage drum set. i visited the store one day (about 10 years ago) and there was the drum set of my dreams. a 4-piece 1962 ludwig gold sparkle set with supraphonic snare drum in original & excellent condition. i was lucky to be one of the first customers to do business with ann & jeff, they are very fair & honest - they sold the drum set to me for $400.(10 years ago) thanks ann & jeff! love you guys! tom -tom, georgia i went to music go round not looking for an instrument, but for strings. the staff at music go round i go to are very friendly. you have questions? they have answers. need a pick to play in store? they have you covered. they have very affordable pricing. for example: i go around looking through their guitars and i find an ibanez s series (with the trem bar still on it!). so i just picked it up, plugged it in, loved it. it was in pretty good shape for a used guitar. it only had one chip on it but i still wanted it. i got it at a very good deal, $216.xx total. i now play with it all the way. hasn't given me any problems (which i expected). i would continue to shop music go round because of the service. -antonio, texas i just checked out your site to compare prices on a fender i have to sell and noticed alexx won your latest b.o.m competition! i want to be accepted into your next competition! how do i do that? i just finished my 4th record (1st full length), wrapped my first music video shoot this weekend, and recently opened for paula cole, meiko and serena ryder! i hope you check out my stuff and if nothing else...maybe you find a new singer/songwriter that you like;) thank you!! sincerely, ~alyssa jacey p.s. the photo attached relates to my story b/c it's a still from a video taken at yesterday's shoot -alyssa, california my son just took up the bass for his school band. i played bass in high school and i wanted to get a cheap bass so i could re-learn along with my son. the father/son owned franchise in san jose ca was one of the best experiences i have ever had when shopping for music equipment. they have a great staff that were very helpful and i got a great bass for a really great price. thank you for the great service! -chuck, california i came into my local, lincoln ne music-go-round while on a search for a pedal which i was getting for my 16th birthday, and i spotted a beautiful digitech jimi hendrix experience pedal, brand new condition for only around $120 after playing it, i was amazed, because it played as if i ordered it brand new for $200, i then bought it, and spent about a week just jamming in my room, probably my favorite birthday gift in recent memory, thanks music go round! -jason, nebraska since the 80's i've dreamed of a cort effector - at 42 my mom finally got one from y'all - it is a gem a true classic. though there's no musicgoround were i live, i know that my next dream is only a mouse click and phone call away. i will definitely pick y'all for my guitar needs with fast and freindly, reliable and dependable service - what musician could go wrong?
