"because i only recently picked up the modi and magni, i haven't yet had a chance to compare each separately to other dacs and amps, but i can say emphatically that together they're a dac/amp combo that has me giddy about the insane value for the buck it represents. in early listening, it has proven such a resolving, authoritative system, that it will likely be my first recommendation for those looking for an affordable desktop system with high-end performance." read full review -> hifi pig stuart smith hifipig recommended components "...there appears to be an explosiveness (dynamism) to the presentation using the magni/modi combo which is very enjoyable indeed ... it is easy to forget that what we are talking about here is a very well priced bit of kit and not some piece of esoterica. " "...does the schiit warrant an extra couple of hundred quid? – by christ yes! it’s an immensely enjoyable listen with many positives and only a very few negatives which at this price it would be churlish to complain about." "add a good pair of headphones that suit and you’ll be grinning from ear to ear." read full review -> hifi news & record review ken kessler, paul miller "this is honest, right on target...these guys know their schiit." i can’t imagine this much glorious sound from anything less expensive. it joins...a select group of components that let you wallow in decent sound for under a ton. on engineering "schiit’s magni is surely the most the most capable single-input headphone amp at this very affordable ~£100 price point. rated at 1.2w/32ohm, the magni delivered a full 2w/25ohm under test (<1% thd) with a maximum output voltage capability of 8.95v into 47kohm." "arguably the magni’s greatest feature, aside from its prodigious power output, is its fabulously wide 98db a-wtd s/n ratio – another figure for the record books at this price and well beyond." from hifi news & record review, june 2014 wired magazine the gadgets and gear we loved most in may (2014) the magni headphone amp and modi usb dac are sold (separately) by a california-based audio outfit named schiit. they make your music sound the opposite of that. read full review -> 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
