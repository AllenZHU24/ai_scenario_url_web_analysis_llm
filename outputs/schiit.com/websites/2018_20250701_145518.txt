in the old days, audiophiles went up the food chain from the table radio to the console stereo to separate speakers the size of refrigerators and monoblocks that would cook a cat. today, nobody starts with a table radio. everyone—and we mean everyone—starts with headphones. so, yeah. we do a lot of headphone stuff. or "personal audio," as they're starting to call it. but that doesn't mean we don't have products that are totally comfortable in a speaker-based system, from all of our dacs, to the mani phono preamp, to the ragnarok integrated amp. whether you're looking at personal audio or at a speaker-based system, we have fun, affordable products that'll put a smile on your face. so what makes your products special? mike moffat separately aligns each molecule of every jfet, using a special absolute zero containment suit…er, well, no. what makes them special are three things: unique multibit dac and digital filter technologies today, virtually every dac uses a reduced-bit technology known as "delta sigma." multibit dacs have largely gone by the wayside, thanks to less-expensive delta-sigma technology. the few multibit dacs that exist either use nos (new old stock) d/a chips, one of two or three still-extant multibit chips, or build their own r2r ladders at high cost. we've always believed that multibit dacs provide the best sonic performance, especially when coupled with schiit's unique, dsp-based closed-form digital filter. this is why we created two entirely new multibit dac architectures using current-production, medical/military grade d/a converters that have linearity specs far exceeding any audio dac. if you'd like to learn more, read about yggdrasil, gungnir multibit, or bifrost multibit. innovative analog approaches on the analog side, we've also taken innovative approaches, each uniquely designed for the task at hand. even our least expensive headphone amplifier is essentially a miniature, fully discrete, dc coupled, lin-topology power amplifier. we've introduced unique output stages to wring more power out of lyr 2 with its dynamically adaptive output, re-introduced inherently balanced topologies like the circlotron in mjolnir 2, and created unique "analog computer-style" protection systems. for ragnarok, we introduced the entirely new concept of 100% intelligent microprocessor management of the entire amplifier--from bias to dc level to overcorrect protection...and included a relay-switched stepped attenuator, for perfect channel matching and no ics in the signal path...and also created an amplifier that's comfortable driving everything, from tiny iems to giant speakers. designed for the real world the real world is a complex place, which is why all of our products are overbuilt. pick up one of our affordable valhalla 2 or lyr 2 amps, and marvel at the weight, heft, and solidity (each of those two amplifiers use two separate transformers with real high-voltage supplies—an approach that's usually far beyond their modest price. then, we test them extensively with stanford research audio analyzers (and our ears), and we burn-in every product from asgard 2 on up for a minimum of 1 day to help catch any early failures. (ragnarok and yggdrasil get 4 days each). we also keep very close tabs on any service and support needs, so you can rest assured of years of great sound. and—it bears mentioning—we believe that close-coupled, local control of all of the aspects of production delivers better products. that's why we design and produce our stuff here in the usa, with the vast majority of parts cost going to us-based companies manufacturing in the us. we need all of that clarification in there because some people have played games with what "made in usa" means. when we say it, it means that our chassis guys are right over the hill in the san fernando valley, our transformers are made here in california, our boards come from the east coast (of the usa), and we design, assemble, and test everything here in valencia, california. why don’t you check out our schiit? want more info? check out the full story—all 160,000+ words of it—here on head-fi. or, if you're really into it, you can even buy the book. up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and assembled in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
