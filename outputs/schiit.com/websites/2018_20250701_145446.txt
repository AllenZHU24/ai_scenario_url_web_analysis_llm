"want a simple, affordable, great-sounding headphone amp? this is it." read full review -> $99 gizmo kicks up your headphones sound steve guttenberg, cnet audiophiliac "...if you've already invested in a nice set of headphones and never tried them with an amp you don't know how good your headphones really are. you're missing out. to test that assertion i auditioned a set of beyerdynamic t 51p on-ear headphones plugged into my mac mini's headphone jack, and then with the magni 3. the mac mini's sound was a tad dull and bland, while the magni 3 had more kick and energy, so it was more fun to listen to. these headphones really shone with the magni 3. i also listened to the magni 3 with a set of sennheiser momentum 2.0 over-the-ear headphones. the sound was crisp and clean, a big step up from what i got with listening to my iphone 6s, which was dynamically crushed and lifeless by comparison. it wasn't even close." read full review -> one of the best amps we've ever tested. the master switch, rob boffard "and when it comes down to it, what the magni 3 offers is so compelling that we genuinely can’t think of another competitor in this particular price range. up until about $300 – more than three times its cost – there’s simply nothing else like it. it takes all the 2-uber-multibit nonsense of the previous magni generation, and simplifies it. it offers terrific sound, wonderful design, splendid ease-of-use, the ability to power just about any pair of headphones, and – as we keep harping on about – an attractive price. and even if it didn’t, it still has the greatest on-switch noise of any amp out there. so yes: fight us in the comments. go ahead. we love this amp, and think you will, too." read full review -> schiit magni 3 affordable headphone amp and preamp tyler schrank, innerfidelity "it works well with about any headphone with almost no compromises or sonic quirks to nitpick. and i'm not saying it's just good for the money, or that it's a jack of all trades and master of none. it's a truly high-performing, do-it-all, well-rounded, and refined headphone amp regardless of price…but, yes, even more exciting because of its price." read full review -> schiit audio magni 3 the absolute sound, editor's choice "the magni3 offers excellent bass and sub-bass control, pitch definition, and drive, as well as a very dynamic upper midrange...a simple and cost-effective way to drive a wide variety of headphones at or near their optimum potential. up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and assembled in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
