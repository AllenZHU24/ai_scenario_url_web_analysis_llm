amps, with by far the highest output power in their price class. at the same time, they provide the cleanest measured performance of any magnis, ever. go ahead. compare these new magnis to anything out there at the price, and we think you’ll agree: there’s really no competition. not just a “starter amp” any magni model is all the amp you’ll ever need, for any headphone. they all have the power, performance, low noise, and versatility to meet all your needs. you’re set from iems to hard-to-drive planar designs. with a full 2400mw into 32 ohms, magni has tremendous power reserves. combined with low distortion, an exceptionally low noise floor, and switchable gain, all magnis perform far beyond their price. your choice: high performance…higher performance…or highest versatility for magni 3+, we pulled out all the stops in designing the highest performing discrete magni ever, by any metric—power, distortion, or noise floor. but it’s easy to get even higher measured performance from integrated (op amp) designs, so we decided to give you a choice, with magni heresy. choose magni 3+ for the ultimate expression of an affordable all-discrete current-feedback headphone amp. it’s now seriously like a mini speaker amp, right down to the driver stage and vbe multiplier. magni 3+ is in our traditional silver and gray chassis. choose magni heresy for insanely great measurements from an all-op-amp based headphone amp that uses super high quality parts, including a multiple paralleled output stage with feedforward. magni heresy is in a black and red chassis. all magnis sound fantastic. you really can’t make a wrong choice. create a total desktop system all magnis include preamp outputs. this means you can connect any magni to your desktop powered monitors for a complete system—or even connect it to a speaker power amp and use it as a preamp. with its built-in time-delayed start-up and instant shut-down, there’ll be no glitches or pops through either headphones or speakers, either. designed and built in texas by “designed and built in texas" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of magni—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. in the case of the magni family, the chassis are made in california, the pcbs are made in nevada, and it all comes together at our corpus christi, tx facility. 2-year warranty and 15-day return policy all magnis are covered by a 2-year parts and labor warranty. and, if you don’t like your magni, you can still send it back for a refund, minus 15% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving your amp. magni 3+ frequency response: 20hz-20khz, +/-0.04db maximum power, 16 ohms: 2.8w rms per channel maximum power, 32 ohms: 2.4w rms per channel

capacitance power consumption: 6w size: 5 x 3.5 x 1.25” weight: 1 lb apx report for magni heresy wait a sec, there are two magnis now? why u make me indecisive? because some people really like our historic approach to magni, and some people want even better measurements. so we decided to give you both: a magni 3+ that is the ultimate expression of our discrete, current-feedback topology (basically a small speaker amp) and a magni heresy that is 100% integrated—all op-amps, all the time. how do i choose? because you like silver and gray, which is the finish of magni 3+, or black and red, which are magni heresy's colors. no, seriously! i think we covered this in the product description, but here goes again, with more detail magni 3+: choose this one if you want an all-discrete headphone amp. discrete means its made up of lots of individual transistors (well, actually a lot of paired matched transistors now). it’s essentially a mini speaker amp. in fact, the topology is exactly that of a 2-stage speaker amp now, since we added a driver stage and vbe multiplier for biasing. the driver reduces distortion and the vbe multiplier means the bias is more stable. it's a super-advanced amp, and we’re very proud of it. magni heresy: choose this one if you want a 100% op-amp-based headphone amp that delivers spectacular measurements. thank the high-quality op-amps used: opa1688 for gain, opa1688 for output—eight (8) opa1688 stages per channel, for low output impedance and very high current capability. with these advanced parts (the opa1688 even uses feedforward in its topology), we’re getting 6-8db lower thd+n than magni 3+, which is already 10-15db lower thd+n than magni 3. which sounds best? ah hell no, we aren’t falling for that. you tell us. at least give us a hint! we think all magnis sound very, very good, or else we wouldn’t offer them. we developed the magni heresy largely to see what could be accomplished with a simple topology and modern op-amps, but we’re very pleased with the way it came out. at the same time, we think magni 3+ provides compelling reasons that you shouldn’t choose everything simply based on numbers. but seriously, you tell us. why the name “heresy?” when we started developing an all-op-amp magni, it was 100% counter to everything we’ve done. we’ve always done fully discrete designs, when we weren’t so cost-constrained that they weren’t practical. going op-amp was far, far easier, and more typical in today’s world, but it was, well, almost anathema. so to us, an op-amp magni was heresy. but we’re happy with the way it turned out! if heresy is so good, why’d you bother with magni 3+? that’s a great question, isn’t it? why would we bother with a much more complex, harder to produce product that takes a lot more engineering time and skill (the magni 3+)? well, we believe that the numbers don’t tell the entire story. we believe that magni 3+ has a place. but when it comes down to it, it’s your call. so which one is powerful enough for inefficient, planar magnetic headphones? all of them have tons of power—specifically 2.4w rms per channel at less than 1% thd, though both typically perform comfortably above that. why is it a “magni 3+” and not a “magni 4?” why is it a 6s or 8 but not 9 or 10s but 11? nah, sorry, just teasing you, apple fans. there’s a method to our madness. for us, a product gets a “+” when it has the same functionality, but has been changed significantly internally. like freya+ and saga+. a product gets a number bump if the functionality changes. how do you keep getting more and more power out of magni with every iteration? simple: we keep tweaking for higher efficiency. last time it was a topology change. this time it’s a driver stage and optimized emitter resistance. it is about the maximum of what we can do now, though, without giant changes. what’s this about dc coupling? all magnis have no capacitors in the signal path at all—that’s what we mean by dc coupling. this eliminates any sonic effect a capacitor in the signal path might have on your system. so you probably cheaped out and left the protection off these amps, or something stupid like that, right? no. all magnis have relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. you can leave your headphones plugged in all the time. these sound so great! why would i buy any of your other amps? seriously, you really don’t need to. but, you know, different people like different things, and they may want to try out tube amps, or balanced amps, or class a/continuity™ amps, or you might have raal/requisite headphones, and then you actually need a different amp, the jotunheim r, the only direct drive ribbon headphone amp. i want a combined dac/amp! why didn’t you put a dac in here? we did. they’re just in a different chassis and costs another $99-249. they’re called “modi 3” or “modi multibit.” hey, so does that mean i can plug in some uber-special, gold-plated, cryo-treated, 85-lb 2000va wall wart and have even better performance? unless you know what you’re doing, we don’t recommend that. magni uses an ac wall wart. most are dc. dc won’t work with either magni. plus, seriously? this is a $99 amp. you want to use some $599 power supply with it? nah. what the hell is a magni? in norse mythology, magni was one of thor’s sons. schiit magni 3+ & magni heresy - headphone amplifier - review & comparison ian dunsmore, headphones.com "thus magni 3+ becomes my new, and enthusiastic, recommendation for when i am asked which ~$100 amplifier to buy, rather than spending the time to listen to them for yourself and make up your own mind (i will always recommend personally auditioning gear before purchase). even when following the “headphones first” doctrine to extreme levels, the magni 3+ turns in an excellent and compelling performance - and at a level that would have been unthinkable at such a low price-point even a couple of years ago! ultimately, while i feel they serve different masters, and i have a definite preference for the magni 3+, i think both the magni 3+ and heresy are well worth auditioning if you’re looking for a capable, powerful, headphone amplifier of this level and form factor, regardless of where your performance biases sit." schiit's note: review contains subjective comparisons and blind listening with magni 3+, magni heresy, magni 3, liquid spark, atom,

audio is getting cheap, and cheap audio is getting good” and this is becoming very true. it is in my opinion extremely hard to get an amp that sounds this good cheaper. in fact, i don’t think you can buy any amp new cheaper that’s on par with the heresy. i fully believe the heresy can be the end game headphone amp for many people. the heresy has more than enough power to drive just about any headphone, it sounds amazing and stays cool to the touch. i’m not sure you could really ask for anything more… maybe a balanced connector, but here is the kicker. the noise level in the heresy is already so low you really wouldn’t hear any benefits going balanced." read full review -> the new $100 king? josh valour best beginner stacks badseed tech between your ears: schiit audio magni 3+
