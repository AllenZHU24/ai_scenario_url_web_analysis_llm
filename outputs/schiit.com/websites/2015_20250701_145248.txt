no problem. if you’re using headphones, just add a magni uber for adjustable volume via its preamp outputs. no headphones? just add a sys passive preamp for analog volume control. made in usa by “made in usa,” we mean made in usa. the vast majority of the total production cost of modi—chassis, boards, assembly, etc—goes to us companies. our board house is 20 minutes away from our office in newhall. our chassis guys are just over the hill in the valley. 2-year warranty and 15-day return modi is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for two years. that’s 2x the warranty of most of the products in this price range. and, if you don’t like your modi, you can send it back for a refund, minus 15% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. on b stock when we have products with minor cosmetic flaws, we will sell them here as "b-stock". if you choose the b-stock option to save some money, please note that it is not eligible for the 15-day return. however, the full warranty applies. inputs: modi 2: usb 2.0 modi 2 uber: usb 2.0, toslink spdif, coaxial spdif sample rates/bit depths: modi 2: 16/44.1 to 24/96, including 24/88.2, without windows drivers, or up to 24/192 with windows drivers (or using a mac or linux machine) modi 2 uber: 16/44.1 to 24/192 via usb. 16/44.1 to 24/192 via toslink* and coax. *note: many optical transmitters cannot output 24/176 and 24/192 reliably input receiver: usb: c-media cm6631a spdif: akm 4113 d/a conversion ic: akm4396 analog summing, active filtering: based on ad8616 with precision thin-film resistors and film capacitors. output: rca (single-ended) output impedance: 75 ohms frequency response: 20hz-20khz, +/-0.1db maximum output: 1.5v rms thd: <0.002%, 20hz-20khz, at max output imd: <0.003%, ccif, at max output s/n: >104db, referenced to 1.5vrms, unweighted crosstalk: -80db, 20-20khz power supply: modi 2: usb bus powered, 120ma draw modi 2 uber: included 16vac wall-wart size: 5 x 3.5 x 1.25” weight: 1 lb so, you’re saying you plug this in and you’re ready to go? pretty much. in standard mode, modi 2 can be used with virtually any windows or mac computer instantly recognizes modi usb and requires no drivers, and many linux distros that support usb audio standard 2.0 work just fine as well. it can also be used with iphones, ipads, and intel chromebooks, as well as the sony ps4. in expert mode, you’ll need to install drivers on windows, because windows is stuck in some weird time-warp where it's still 1997 and people are gaga over office or something. seriously, everything supports usb audio class 2, including stuff like android phones, linux, and chromebooks. microsoft, you look dumb here. sorry. no other way to put it. and yes, this includes windows 10. argh. and the difference between modi 2 and modi 2 uber? lots. let’s break it down: inputs: modi 2 only has usb, modi 2 uber has usb, optical, and coax. control: modi 2 has no controls, modi 2 uber has an input selection switch. power supply: modi 2 is usb powered, modi 2 uber has a linear power supply and wall-wart. chassis: modi 2 has a painted steel chassis, while modi 2 uber has an aluminum top and pushbutton (pinched off the bifrost, natch!) so how’s the support for linux, idevices, and chromebooks? any linux distro supporting usb audio class 2 will be fine. most do. please note we’re not able to provide troubleshooting or support of linux issues. for iphones/ipads running ios7/8, you can connect digitally with the lightning to usb adapter sold by apple, but you may need a powered usb hub to avoid the "this device draws too much power" error. intel-based chromebooks also work, though amd seems to be a bit of a crapshoot. i want a combined dac/amp! why didn’t you put an amp in here? we did. they’re just in different chassis and costs another $99-149. they’re called “magni 2” and “magni 2 uber.” stack the two and tell yourself it’s a combined dac/amp for $198-298. mix and match for exactly what you want. ha. try that with a combined dac/amp. also try not to shed any tears as you throw away a perfectly good amp with that amp/dac when digital technology changes. face it, you want separates. if this thing is so great, why would i step up to bifrost or gungnir? because you want even higher performance. or upgradability. modis aren’t upgradable. but i heard all dacs sound the same! you’re bullshitting us! if it’s your experience that all dacs sound the same, that’s cool. there’s a dac in your iphone or android phone, so you can use that one and save some cash. here's a pair of high-end yet affordable components from schiit audio steve guttenberg, cnet audiophiliac "the schiit magni 2 uber headphone amp and modi 2 uber digital converter are downright affordable, but still qualify as legitimate high-end audio components." "next, i tried my oppo pm-3 headphones with the magni 2 uber/ modi 2 uber stack, and the headphone's newfound transparency took by breath away. this headphone is the one to beat for the price (us $400, uk £349, au$549). pairing it with the two little schiits is the most affordable way to unleash the pm-3's sound potential." read full review -> how to get $6,500 out of a $650 sound system roy furchgott, maxim magazine "for you to hear digital music, it has to be converted from zeros and ones back to the sound wave it was originally—that requires a digital-to-analog converter. the one that comes in your music player or computer isn’t a very good one. but you can replace it with something like the schiit modi 2 uber, a high quality dac that makes music more clear, defined and smooth—almost like it was spinning on virgin vinyl. and yes, schiit is pronounced the way you think." read full review -> the magni 2u & modi 2u by schiit smit patel "overall, the schiit magni 2u and the schiit modi 2u are a mini-powerhouse that truly shatters the general price performance ratio by putting many higher models to shame. having recently reviewed the fiio q1, i thought i would not find a dac/amp that would perform as well as it does for its price alone but the schiit stack definitely challenges my initial thoughts. i was not only surprised by the levels of transparency but also the hi-fidelity sound that can be attained for only $300." "coupled to this, the build quality of both the schiit magni 2u amp and the schiit modi 2u dac is simply outstanding with a well-implemented brushed aluminium chassis. next to the polished looking plussound cloud nine amp, the schiit stack looks decidedly classier with durability infused with functionality." read full review -> comparison of mid-fi dac/amp combination units marv (aka purrin) compared to grace m9xx, jdslabs element, lhlabs geek out v2 infinity, ifi nano idsd "best stage of the bunch. the deepest, but not overly wide. crisp controlled attacks and transients with good bite. despite bass being a tiny bit leaner than the best, dense tones, and nuanced with excellent gradations of sound levels." start at the linked post and scroll down for subjective impressions and intangibles. read full review -> what is a dac, and do you need one? g. clay whittaker, popular science "for $200 you may never go back to mediocre sound again" "across the board, boy was the sound crisp. movie soundtracks took on new depths. i heard subtleties in the dialogue of hannibal lecter in “silence of the lambs” and picked up on previously unheard parts of tracks off a favorite weezer album." read full review -> modi 2 manual modi 2 uber manual schiit drivers up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
