we made a deal with satan. no, not really. there’s no black magic or soul-selling involved. smart design and large quantity manufacturing are really what we’re talking about. magni uses a fully custom chassis, yes, but it’s made entirely of steel, which reduces price. surface-mount design means the assembly is almost entirely robotic. and we make, well, a ton of them at a time. did you say this thing will drive orthos? many of them, yes. the hifiman he400 and he500 do well with magni, as well as the audeze lcd2. the popular fostex t50rp mods (mad dog, paradox) are also a good match. he-6, not so much. and iems too? yes. magni’s noise floor is low enough for most of them, though magni’s gain of 5 (necessary for orthos and high-impedance headphones) might mean you have to use software volume control to get a good range of adjustment on the volume pot. and other headphones? of course. magni may be the only amp you ever need. then why would i step up to asgard, or any of your other amps? because you have an aluminum fetish. or, more seriously, because you want a class-a, no-overall-feedback design, or because you want tubes, or because you want balanced outputs. or because you want more capability, like preamp outs. so you probably cheaped out and left the protection off this amp, or something stupid like that, right? no. magni has a relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. you can leave your headphones plugged in all the time. what the hell is a magni? in norse mythology, magni was one of thor’s sons. there’s this amazing resource called wikipedia. you may have heard of it. i want a combined dac/amp! why didn’t you put a dac in here? we did. it’s just in a different chassis and costs another $99. it’s called “modi.” stack the two and tell yourself it’s a combined dac/amp for $198. what’s your problem with combined dac/amps? why can’t you put them in the same box? call us old-fashioned, but we don’t like multi-megahertz digital noise cruising around in the same chassis as sensitive analog amplification components. nor do we like the planned obsolescence of a perfectly good amp when digital technology moves on. let’s face it, you’ll probably be changing the dac before the amp. why didn’t you put batteries in this stupid thing so it’s portable? we’re really not into battery-powered amps. lithium power cells mean switching supplies (and extra insurance riders for the production line, and shipping headaches.) dual 9v would work for lower power output, but you have to deal with charging and power management. in the end, we chose to design with ac input and 15v rails, for better power output. hey, so does that mean i can plug in some uber-special, gold-plated, cryo-treated, 85-lb 2000va wall wart and have even better performance? unless you know what you’re doing, we don’t recommend that. magni uses an ac wall wart. most are dc. dc won’t work with magni. hey, i have a buttload of wall-warts for routers, phone chargers, talking desk figurines, etc. what if i accidentally plug in the wrong wall wart? most likely nothing. most other wall-warts are dc. unless you supply magni with ac, the relay will never connect the output to your headphones. let’s talk tech. what’s the big deal about discrete design? discrete design allows us to create a dc-coupled stage with excellent power output and low output impedance, as well as good performance. sure, we could throw an opamp in there and get better numbers, but we aren’t just about the numbers here. we believe different amps sound, well, different, and we made our design decisions based on both measurements and listening tests. so, i notice you aren’t talking about “no feedback” here. what’s up? magni does use overall feedback, but at a much lower level than op-amp designs. feedback is necessary to linearize a class ab output stage for good performance at this level. while our other amps use no-overall-feedback designs with high voltage input stages and class a output stages to get good performance, the heat and complexity simply wouldn’t fly in this tiny, inexpensive amp. wait. are you saying this is a schiit amp that doesn’t double as a barbecue? how am i gonna cook my burgers? buy a grille. we hear lowes is having a sale. what’s this about dc coupling? magni has no capacitors in the signal path at all—that’s what we mean by dc coupling. it uses a dc servo to eliminate dc on the output, which is a more sophisticated method than using coupling caps. but i heard all amps sound the same! you’re bullshitting us! if it’s your experience that all amps sound the same, that’s cool. there are plenty of other options out there, including some that are much less expensive than ours. cnet steve guttenberg “the magni headphone amp and the modi dac are also made in america, and they sound spectacular…the magni amp puts out up to 1.2 watts, so it’s considerably more powerful than your average av receiver’s headphone amp. and unlike those built-in headphone amps, the magni is not a chip-based amp that costs 20 cents…the magni’s innards feature fully discrete fet/bipolar, class ab circuitry. that means the magni is built like a miniature high-end speaker amplifier. i don’t know of another headphone amp built that way for less than $250, and most $250-$500 amps aren’t built as well as the magni. i played the magni and modi together, and loved the sound. like the bigger schiit amps i’ve tested, the sound is rich, with lots of detail and oomph…they deliver bona-fide high-end sound quality.” read full review -> headfonia michael piskor “it is a great entry level hi-fi amplifier that will be adored by anyone who does not want congestion on their desk at work, inside their college dorm room or perhaps even on their bedside table…i feel safe in saying the clarity on the magni for this price is a 10/10 and that clarity is on par with portable amplifiers 4x its price." noble reviews ed noble “the sound of the modi and magni combination is very impressive considering their modest size and price! there’s a great body to the low frequencies whilst maintaining a generally balanced tonality that manages to squeeze the best out of many good headphones. i especially enjoyed the combo with larger, more open sounding headphones. i keep taking the sennheiser hd650 to the schiit combo, over some considerably more expensive dac/amp combos.” “final thoughts: i’ve been smitten by the modi and magni combo ever since i hooked them up to my computers. i love the looks, the form factor and the build quality. the sound is beautifully dynamic, superbly detailed and extremely spacious. they manage to push the sound in the right direction with almost every pair of headphones that i throw at them. the power and performance they possess is highly impressive considering their modest price and i would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who is looking for a dedicated headphone rig at this price.” read full review -> alpha audio yung lie 4,5 stars out of 5! “for less than 250 euro for the modi and maxi you purchase an impressive system. it doesn’t just look good, it also sounds good: full and powerfull. the schiits are quirky but impressive devices that deserve to be auditioned.” “so how does this sound? the short answer is: suprisingly good given the price. the difference with the standard headphone output on a computer or smartphone is huge. the modi delivers a beautiful and wide, very balanced sound. music appears in a real soundstage, which we consider to be the hallmark of true high end. the low end is full and extended but never overpowering.” “we also found that these components work as good as separates as they work together. the schiit modi and magni make a veryy good impression on their own. the modi will make an excellent dac on your ‘big system’, the magni is a more than adequate alternative for the standard headphone output on your amplifier.” read full review -> head-fi 2013 summer buying guide jude mansilla "what does the magni drive? so far, everything i've thrown at it. rated at a conservative 1.2w into 32 ohms--and with a very low noise floor--i've driven several headphones, from my most sensitive iems to the hard-to-drive hifiman he-6 planars." "because i only recently picked up the modi and magni, i haven't yet had a chance to compare each separately to other dacs and amps, but i can say emphatically that together they're a dac/amp combo that has me giddy about the insane value for the buck it represents. in early listening, it has proven such a resolving, authoritative system, that it will likely be my first recommendation for those looking for an affordable desktop system with high-end performance." read full review -> hifi pig stuart smith hifipig recommended components "...there appears to be an explosiveness (dynamism) to the presentation using the magni/modi combo which is very enjoyable indeed ... it is easy to forget that what we are talking about here is a very well priced bit of kit and not some piece of esoterica. " "...does the schiit warrant an extra couple of hundred quid? – by christ yes! it’s an immensely enjoyable listen with many positives and only a very few negatives which at this price it would be churlish to complain about." "add a good pair of headphones that suit and you’ll be grinning from ear to ear." read full review -> magni/modi owner's manual 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
