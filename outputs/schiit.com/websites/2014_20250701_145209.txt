yep. development improves the breed. plus, if nobody else is going to compete with us, we figured that we’d go ahead and do it. now you’re just being cheeky! yes. you’re right. sorry about that. seriously, magni 2 addresses one of the limitations of magni: it adds a gain switch, so that it’s more usable with highly sensitive headphones. while we were at it, we had another look at the gain stage and refined it. and, while we were at that, we made a “do-all” magni with preamp outputs and a bigger transformer and an even more refined gain stage. and we liked that, too. so we decided to introduce both of them. so what’s the difference between magni 2 and magni 2 uber? lots of things. let’s break it down: preamp outputs: uber has them, standard doesn’t. gain stage: uber has a complementary-input vas, standard doesn’t. power supply: uber has 3x the transformer (24va vs 8va) and 1.6x the filter capacitance (6,400 vs 4,000uf), as well as more sophisticated regulators (programmable vs fixed) and a higher rail voltage (+/-16v vs +/-15v) chassis: uber gets an aluminum top cover and solid aluminum milled knob, standard is painted steel and an aluminum-covered plastic knob. isn’t this just a trick to get us to buy a magni uber for $50 more? um, no. if you don’t need preamp outputs, you’re gonna be plenty happy with magni 2, no matter what headphones you use. it’s probably the only amp anyone really needs, but because we don’t live in a regime where the headphone amp commissar decides what headphone amp you’re going to get, we have a lot more choices as well. so did you say these amps will drive any headphone? yes. except maybe the he-6. that’s about it. including hard-to-drive orthos? yes. including iems? yes. so you probably cheaped out and left the protection off this amp, or something stupid like that, right? no. magni 2 and magni 2 uber have relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. you can leave your headphones plugged in all the time. magni 2 uber also automatically disconnects the preamp outputs when you plug headphones in. amazing things, switches. what the hell is a magni? in norse mythology, magni was one of thor’s sons. there’s this amazing resource called wikipedia. you may have heard of it. i want a combined dac/amp! why didn’t you put a dac in here? we did. they’re just in a different chassis and costs another $99-149. they’re called “modi 2” or “modi 2 uber” stack the two and tell yourself it’s a combined dac/amp for $198-298. mix n match to get exactly what you want. ha. try that with a combined dac/amp. oh, yeah, and only scrap the dac when technology changes. try that with a combined dac/amp, too. yeah. thought so. hey, so does that mean i can plug in some uber-special, gold-plated, cryo-treated, 85-lb 2000va wall wart and have even better performance? unless you know what you’re doing, we don’t recommend that. magni2 and magni 2 uber use an ac wall wart. most are dc. dc won’t work. let’s talk tech. what’s the big deal about discrete design? discrete design allows us to create a dc-coupled stage with excellent power output and low output impedance, as well as good performance. it also allows us to do things we could never do with op-amps, like design a stage with constant feedback across the audio band. what’s the big deal about “constant feedback?” magni 2 and magni 2 uber use a gain stage that has an open-loop bandwidth greater than 20khz. that means that the feedback is constant across the entire audio band. by comparison, most op-amps start rolling off at 10-100hz, which means there could be 20-30db less feedback at high gain. what’s this about dc coupling? magni has no capacitors in the signal path at all—that’s what we mean by dc coupling. it uses a dc servo to eliminate dc on the output, which is a more sophisticated method than using coupling caps. but i heard all amps sound the same! you’re bullshitting us! if it’s your experience that all amps sound the same, that’s cool. there are plenty of other options out there, including the one that came in your phone, for free. magni 2 owner's manual magni 2 uber owner's manual 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
