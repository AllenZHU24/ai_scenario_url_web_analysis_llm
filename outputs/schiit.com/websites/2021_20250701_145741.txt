in 1-3 days *except* less is more ships in 10-12 weeks. description faq bring any yggdrasil up to less is more, more is less, or og (analog 2) spec with these upgrades. all upgrades includes (2) yggdrasil analog 2 output cards, and firmware update for the dsp board. due to the need for firmware and hardware updates, these upgrade is highly recommended to be done by schiit, or by an authorized service center such as electromod in the uk. schiit scheduling system reduces upgrade time we've provided a convenient scheduling system that allows you to keep your yggdrasil until we’re ready to upgrade it immediately. just place your order, and follow the steps in the series of emails. you’ll be notified when your order is accepted, when to send in your dac, when the work is performed, and when it’s shipped back to you, for complete transparency. other installation options you can choose to have these upgrade boards sent to you directly, fully tested and protected in an antistatic bag, together with an eeprom with firmware for the dsp board. please note that by selecting this option, you are saying, "yes, i am, or know, a competent electronics technician who does not need hand-holding for this installation, and i will not allow an inexperienced person to perform the upgrade, since i understand there are no user-serviceable parts inside." 2-year warranty yggdrasil upgrades are covered by a 2-year warranty or the balance of the original factory warranty, whichever is greater. for factory-installed upgrades on out-of-warranty products, this re-activates the warranty on the complete product for 2 years. one caveat: schiit may refuse to do upgrades on heavily modified products. schiit-installed upgrades cannot be returned. for self-installed upgrades, you can return the card in its original packaging, in undamaged and operational condition, in 15 days for a refund, minus 15% reinspection and restocking fee. schiit installed upgrades cannot be returned. please note these upgrades do not include the unison usb input, so if you want that too, you'll need to order both options. what is the difference between these upgrades? i think we covered that in the product description, but let’s get into a bit more detail here. the flavors are as follows: yggdrasil less is more. least expensive. uses four ti 16-bit dacs and integrated differential amplification afterwards. because it’s 16 bits, and because the dacs cost less than the other options, it is less expensive than any other version. it also measures a bit better than the yggdrasil og (!) despite being down 4 bits. this is the wonder and magic of dither. yggdrasil more is less. middle priced. uses four ti 20-bit dacs and integrated differential amplification afterwards. these new dac11001 dacs are very interesting, in that they really push the limits of measured multibit performance. the golden age of pcm63? yeah, those records are nuked from orbit. the dac11001 delivers performance nearing the top of today’s dacs, while still being truly multibit. yggdrasil og. highest price. uses four analog devices 20-bit dacs and discrete analog buffering and summing afterwards. lowest performance when measured with steady-state sine waves, but some still prefer this version to this day. higher priced due to expensive dacs and discrete analog. i am offended that i have to think and choose. why can’t you be like other companies that double the price of the new model, make me buy a new one, but soothe my ego by saying i will see unicorns and meet god without taking drugs? because we truly believe, based on years of research (and 10 yggdrasil analog card variations) that once you reach this level of performance, you’re really talking about system synergy, rather than night and day differences. hence, “flavors.” some companies would have done less is more, priced it at $3995, and called it a day. however, we are weird. we do things like “thunderdomes” to give you options, and we don’t believe in one true path. because if there was one, we wouldn’t periodically “rediscover” products like ancient dacs, antique class a power amps, and various tube gear dating back to the time the earth cooled. we also do weird things like pricing products based on what it costs to make them, rather than what the market will bear, so all of the yggdrasil versions are based on the prices of their d/a converters. that’s why in the end, we decided to offer some different versions of our top product, run a double-blind listening test with three reviewers to help you choose, and see where that takes us. if you don’t like our approach, we completely understand—there are many other companies producing fine equipment out there. up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back
