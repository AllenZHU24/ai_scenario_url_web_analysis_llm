"considering its very low price, the fulla is an easy choice for recording musicians who have wished for a way to listen to high-res audio without relying on laptop headphone jacks, but couldn’t justify the cost of a high-end solution." up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
