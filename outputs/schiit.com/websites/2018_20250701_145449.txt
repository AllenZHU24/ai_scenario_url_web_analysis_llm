reality happened. the reality is that there are a ton of dongle-dacs out there, but most people want a dac/amp flexible enough for everything on their desktop. so we redesigned fulla from the ground up to meet that need. that’s why it now has: a big-ass volume knob connected to a well-matched alps rk09 pot (like we use in magni) a ¼” full-sized headphone output a 1/8” stereo analog input (so you can use it as just an amp, bypassing the dac) a 1/8” fixed dac output (so you can use it with a receiver or volume control, bypassing the internal amp) a 1/8” variable dac output (so you can use it with powered monitors, or an amp without volume control) usb micro inputs for both data/power and power alone (because so many software and/or hardware companies are incompetent…er, wait, no, we mean because there are usb outputs that are power-managed to the point where they don’t work at all. a second power input allows you to connect your phone charger or other 5v supply and bypass usb power.) wait another sec. are you saying that if i plug my phone charger into the power-only usb input, that means the fulla 2 tells my computer that it doesn’t need any power? yes. or your phone, or tablet, or any other device plugged into the data/power usb port. technically, fulla 2 tells your computer or phone it needs the full 500ma a usb2 port can supply, unless you plug in a separate power usb, in which case, it tells your computer or phone that it needs 0ma. so, also on this usb power thing, does that mean i can use a super-crazy linear supply that costs 3x as much as the fulla 2 to get better performance? go back and read what you just asked. seriously, just use your phone charger or something. yeah, i hear you, but i really really really want to spend a lot of money on a linear power supply that does nothing! we understand. and you should be free to waste your money any way you'd like. but really, your super-pristine linear supply with the regurgitson ultraregulators isn't gonna do anything, since it's running through a switching supply anyway. you know, just like lots of other, more expensive products do...except we tell you this, and don't encourage you to throw money down the loo. so i can use this with idevices and android phones with no powered hub? many of them, yes. as long as you have a 5v charger of reasonable quality with a micro usb connector for output. you know, like for charging phones. however, note that android devices are highly variable—just because they're running the latest os doesn't mean the hardware is up to the task. some will need helper software like uapp. so i can use this with both headphones and powered monitors? yep! so i can use this as just an amp? yep! or i can use this as just a dac? yep! either as fixed or variable output, too. if i plug in headphones… it automatically mutes the preamp outputs. see, we’re getting good at predicting what you’re gonna ask. kinda like autocorrect. but with less embarrassing mistakes. we hope. whoa. that’s a whole lot of features! how do you do it for $99 in the usa? by making tons of them, selling direct, and not being greedy. so why would i step up to a magni/modi 2 stack? or vali 2? more power, more flexibility, bigger wallet, bigger desk—remember, magni/modi/vali combos range from $198 to $418, and cover basic usb-powered dacs to multibit dacs, solid-state to tube amps. consider fulla 2 a great way to get into the world of headphone dac/amps, at only ½ the price of the least expensive magni/modi 2 stack. so is this gonna sound great with my headphones? for most headphones, yes. there are some headphones out there that are very hard to drive, or insanely sensitive. check with the headphone manufacturer if you're unsure. is 550mw into 16 ohms a lot of power? well, you’re not going to arc-weld with it or anything, but it is about 10x the output power of a typical headphone jack on a computer or mobile device. what comes in the box, besides the fulla? do i get a cable with this? yes, we supply a 3’ micro usb (to standard usb) cable. yeah, we know apple and some other doods are going full-nuts on usb-c. one word: adapters. what about the 1/8” to xlr, or 1/8” to rca, or 1/8” to 1/8”, or 1/8” to din, or whatever cables i need to connect to my speakers or dacs? that’s a lot of cables. and this thing is $99. check out monoprice for 1/8" to dual rca cables and all the other crazy cables you might need. can i use a fancier cable to get better sound? you can do whatever you’d like, including dancing by the light of the full moon and making small, non-living sacrifices to the audiophile gods. no, seriously. we are being serious. i’m asking specifically about the cable. as long as it’s a usb 2.0-rated cable, 2m or less in length, terminated with a micro usb plug on one end, you can use it, sure. and it’ll sound better? probably about as much as taping $100 bills to your headphones. or sending the $100 bills to us. we prefer the latter. you’re messing with me! just a little. so what’s fulla in norse? fulla is a goddess, “bountiful”, and a healer. and if you’re looking to relax to some great tunes on the go, the schiit fulla can definitely be a bountiful healer. and that’s not fulla schiit. the master switch rob boffard "ultimately, it’s impossible not to recommend the fulla 2." "even if you don’t know the world of amps at all, and you just want something to improve your computer sound, then this is - by some margin - the easiest, most flexible and most effective way of doing so. its versatility, solid sound and superb design make it highly worthwhile, and we think you’re going to love it. we did." read full review -> digital audio review john darko "for the newcomer, it’s a taste of high end audio minus the wallet pain. a dac, a headphone amplifier and a pre-amplifier for the price of three or four new vinyl records. what’s not to like?" "like every single other schiit audio product that has preceded it, the fulla 2 is sharply priced but feels a long way from cheap." read full review -> listening session as history lesson, b/w schiit and shinola—together at last stephen mejias, audiostream "with good recordings, excellent recordings, and even with shitty recordings, the fulla 2 consistently made music—compelling, colorful, fun music. it drove the shinola canfields easily and happily, allowing them to sound exactly like themselves, but better [footnote 3]. it did the same for my prototype audioquest nighthawks, offering an impressively large, immersive, and seductive presentation." read full review -> schiit audio fulla 2 dac/headphone amp mike metlay, recording magazine "the fulla sounded great, but the fulla 2 sounds better; this is a really good-sounding unit that drives even the most finicky headphones to high levels with clarity and punch. everything from my custom in-ears to my old 600ω akg k240 phones loved the fulla 2, and it did a great job driving the neumann kh 80 dsp monitors in our office studio." "the fulla 2 is a high-class audio output system for less than a benjamin. that’s some impressive schiit right there!" schiit fulla 2 aio dac/headamp quick impressions and review marv chen, superbestaudiofriends.com "the fulla 2 actually sounds a lot like the magni / modi 2 stack. maybe 5% less slam. 5% less micro-stuff. 5% less attack. 5% smaller stage. 5% less clarity. you get the idea." "the volume knob is a godsend. thank you @schiit! trying to set volume on windows ui sliders with a mouse is like steering the enterprise-e with touch screen panel. the fact is, when the enterprise-e is in deep doo doo, like in an asteroid field with hundreds of lives at stake, commander riker is going to use a fricking joystick to get them out of trouble." read full review -> fulla 2 owner's manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and assembled in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
