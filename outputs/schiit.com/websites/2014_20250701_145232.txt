no. and the price tag is the same. thanks for noticing so we can point that out here. so what did you change? a lot of things. first, a regulated 180v power supply for the tube stage, as well as separate regulated supplies for the current sources and dc servo. this allows us to offer a significantly lower noise floor than the original lyr. second, regulated supplies for dc heaters. again, lower noise floor. a refined dynamically adaptive output stage that reduces high frequency distortion. and a new layout that allows for more optimized grounding. so why didn’t you put all that crap in lyr? development improves the breed. and surface mount. without surface mount components, all that crap wouldn’t fit in lyr 2. it certainly didn’t fit in lyr. i hate your humor, why can’t you be serious? because “audiophile” does not have to mean “born with a stick up your ass.” plus, people without a sense of humor usually need a psychologist shipped to them with every product. we have not successfully developed a portable or automated psychologist, and our boxes are not large enough to fit a real one into. what about the tubes? can you roll ‘em? lyr 2 uses two 6bz7 dual triodes, and yes–you can substitute any 6dj8/6922/ecc88 type tube, including nos, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc. due to the dc heaters, we do not recommend using 6n1p tube types, or any tube that needs more than 415ma heater current. are you saying that lyr 2 is now quiet enough to run iems? many of them. although lyr 2 will never be as quiet as asgard 2 or magni, it’s pretty darn quiet in low gain mode. and really—think about what putting 6 watts directly to your eardrums means. is that such a great idea? why the hell do you need a 6 watt headphone amplifier for iems? you don’t. but you might want it for your orthos. lots of people have lots of different headphones. no, seriously, why do you need a 6 watt headphone amp, period? why the hell do you need 400 horsepower? why the hell do you need bacon-wrapped hot dogs? why the hell do you need anything that’s fun and exciting in life? face it, you don’t need anything. you should renounce all your worldly possessions and become a monk. i was told all amps sound the same. aren’t you bullschiiting us? if you believe that, there are plenty of options that cost a lot less than our stuff. why waste your money? go buy something else for $39, or use your ipod. so can i leave my headphones plugged in all the time, or do i have to do the unplug-and replug thing every time i turn lyr 2 off and on? you can leave them plugged in all the time. lyr 2 has a muting relay which delays output on first turn-on, and mutes the output on turn-off. does the volume control adjust the preamp outputs? yes. can i turn off the headphone outs when i’m using the preamp outputs? the preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. unplug your headphones to use the pre outs. how do i switch the gain? there’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp. what is this marketing bullschiit known as a dynamically adaptive output stage? it’s an ancient teutonic magic trick, known only to 4 people in the world. it was passed down by dieter burnhard iii to mike moffat through direct mental transfer. no, really. it’s a current-sensing adaptive output topology which allows the amplifier to dynamically adjust to the headphone load. the primary benefits are essentially single-ended class-a operation for high-impedance headphones, moving seamlessly to push-pull class a and finally into class ab as current needs increase. this provides much higher overall efficiency. that doesn’t help! i’m sorry, we only speak engineerese here. positive feedback: neoteric listener dean seislove "i compared the schiit combo with other headphone amp/dac solutions. travel size contenders included the light harmonic geek out, centrance dacport lx, the aforementioned adl x1, and the devilsound dac v2.1. the larger amp/dacs used included the audioengine d2 and peachtree audio inova integrated...the lyr 2 and bifrost uber dac simply bests the competition in every aspect that matters. the schiit opened the soundstage dramatically to fill the headphones with space and sound, as if the musicians stopped playing in the backstage waiting room and started again on the stage." "all three schiit products [lyr 2, bifrost uber, valhalla 2] are stellar accomplishments that should please even the fussiest headphone audio enthusiast." read full review -> audiophilia (grado gs1000e/lyr 2) martin appel "as i mentioned earlier, the musical fidelity v-cans headphone amp provided a serviceable level of performance but the lyr 2 moved the bar much higher and i now understood why grado named their headphones the statement. the headphones sounded three dimensional, dynamic with a full frequency response. imaging was excellent without any edge or artificiality. the subtleties of the music were clearly expressed with detail that didn’t shout at you. the combination was warm and sumptuous." read full review -> lyr 2 owner's manual 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
