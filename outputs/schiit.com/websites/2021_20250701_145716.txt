downloads the modi twins are two tiny dacs that really deliver. whether you want better sound from your computer, tv, streamer, tablet, cd player, or many other sources, modi 3+ delivers. or, choose modi multibit—the most affordable member of the schiit multibit dac family. modi 3+: all the dac you need—for $99 plug modi 3+ into any virtually any computer or streamer and you’re ready to go, complete with the best usb interface available: schiit’s own unison usb™. or, choose an optical or coaxial digital source with the included wall power supply. or connect to your phones and tablets that need a low-power-draw device, again using the wall power supply. modi 3+ accepts pretty much any input you can throw at it! modi multibit: the most affordable true multibit™ dac modi multibit is the most affordable multibit dac with a modern architecture—from any manufacturer, from any country in the world. featuring schiit’s unique digital filter, and using the analog devices ad5547 multibit dac, modi multibit smashes the high-price barrier in multibit dacs. like modi 3, modi multibit accepts usb, optical, and coaxial digital inputs. need volume control? no problem. if you’re using headphones, just add a magni for adjustable volume via its preamp outputs. no headphones? just add a sys passive preamp for analog volume control. designed and built in california and texas by “designed and built in california and texas" this is what we mean: we manufacture in valencia, ca and corpus christi, texas, and the vast majority of the total production cost of modi 3+ and modi multibit—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. 2-year warranty and 15-day returns modi is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for two years. and, if you don’t like your modi, you can still send it back for a refund, minus 15% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving your dac. inputs: usb, toslink spdif, coaxial spdif

modi multibit holy crap, a do-all modi 3+ for $99! yes. but that’s not all. it also includes our own usb interface, unison usb™. and it’s also the most versatile modi we’ve ever made. aaaaand it also comes with a cable and a wall power supply. and a true multibit™ dac for $249! yep, modi multibit is the least expensive multibit dac based on a modern platform—from any manufacturer, anywhere. we’re pretty proud of it. it’s got a whole lot of technology packed into it, from its dsp-based digital filter to the unique-to-audio ad5547 d/a converter. and, it has a 100% linear power supply, 100% standard. so, you’re saying you plug these in and you’re ready to go? pretty much. both modis can be used with virtually any computer with no drivers: windows, mac, or linux distros that support uac 2.0. some older windows machines may need a driver, which are provided for modi multibit at schiit.com/drivers. (modi 3+ does not offer drivers for older versions of windows.) you can also use both modis with phones and tablets, as well as most intel chromebooks. modi 3+ makes using phones and tablets easier, though, because if you use the provided wall-wart and usb cable into its external power port, it will avoid the dreaded “draws too much power” error. modi multibit may need an external hub or a powered apple cable to avoid the “draws too much power” error. what’s the difference between modi 3+ and modi multibit? lots. let’s break it down: control: modi 3+ uses a toggle switch to select inputs, modi multibit has a pushbutton with led indication. d/a converter: modi 3+ uses the akm ak4490 dac, a respected delta-sigma dac. modi multibit uses the ad5547, a unique-to-audio multibit dac. digital filter: modi 3+ uses the digital filter embedded into the ak4490 dac, while the modi multibit features our own unique closed-form digital filter implemented on an analog devices sharc dsp. analog section: modi 3+ uses the opa1662 op-amp and is dc-coupled, modi multibit uses the ad8512 and discrete jfet buffers and is dc-coupled with a dc servo. power supply: modi 3+ is powered by usb and uses a switching power supply. modi multibit has a linear power supply and wall-wart. miscellaneous: modi 3+ ships with a usb to micro usb cable and a universal 5v usb wall adapter, modi multibit ships only with a 16vac wall-wart (no cables) hey, wait, your "universal" wall adapter for modi 3 has a us plug on it. what if i need a europlug/uk plug/australian plug/martian/borg/uninsulated victorian/alternate timeline edison dc plug? the wall adapter is universal in the sense that you can plug it into pretty much any common ac wall voltage--100v to 240v--and it will (a) not self-immolate, and (b) provide 5v out of a usb connector. it does have a us/japan style plug, but you can use a plug adapter and plug it in pretty much anywhere. or you can use any 5v-out usb wall adapter you have handy. or a battery pack. or a computer. wow, so what’s the catch with modi 3+? it seems too good to be true. the catch is you don’t get the fancy button and leds of the modi multibit. you also don’t get the dsp-based digital filter, or the ad5547 dac. you also lose the linear power supply for a switcher. i thought you hated switching power supplies! we’ve said we would never use one where we didn’t need to. in this case, to hit the performance and price we were looking for, it needed a switcher. don’t worry. it’s a very nice switcher. well, i’m gonna get me a fancy-shmantzy linear power supply and plug it into the back your modi 3, what do you think about that? we think you’re a little strange, because the output of that fancy power supply is going into a switcher, anyway. but if it makes you happy, we’re not going to stop you. nor will we try to sell you such a power supply. well, let’s change the subject to modi multibit. it looks like it doesn’t measure as well as modi 3, is that right? right. if you’re looking at standard performance metrics for steady-state signals, delta-sigma dacs will measure better than multibit. if you’re looking for measurements, modi 3 is your dac. but you think the modi multibit sounds better? yes. you guys are a little touched in the head, aren’t you? quite possibly. but i don’t get why you’d want to have a worse-measuring product— let us cut you off right there, because we know how this argument goes. and goes. and goes. and keeps on going. here’s the deal: we are free to believe what we want. so are you. if your belief system leads you to devices that perform well by standard metrics, cool. if not, that’s also cool. there’s room for both viewpoints. look up “schiit happened, the objectivist/subjectivist synthesis.” and even then you may think we’re entirely full of it. and that’s cool. so what platforms does your usb input support? actually, the question should be “what platforms support your usb input?” since both of our usb inputs (c-media and unison usb) are 100% uac2 compliant (that is, usb audio class 2, the accepted standard for usb audio transmission.) so, here you go: windows. windows 10 is highly recommended. it is usually plug and play with our dacs. windows 7 and 8 will work with modi multibit only, but will need drivers that are available at schiit.com/drivers. windows xp, vista, and windows server editions are all untested and are not recommended. mac osx. from 10.7 on up, macs have been plug and play with modi multibit. from 10.10 on up, you’re good to go with unison usb on modi 3+. this now includes mac os 11. ios. from ios7 on up, ios devices work with our dacs using a usb camera connection kit, lightning to usb camera adapter, or lightning to usb3 camera adapter. android. most android devices that shipped with android m or above work with our dacs using a usb otg cable. some may require separate player software, like usb audio player pro. linux. most linux distros that support uac2 natively will be plug and play with our dacs. please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for linux. roon. roon recognizes our products and is plug and play. most streamers. most streamers are linux-based, so they have no problem with our usb input. what’s so special about unison usb? it’s a very good usb interface designed to do a single thing well: to interface seamlessly with modern uac2-compliant devices. there’s no stuff in it for dsd or mqa. it doesn’t have drivers for now-obsolete windows platforms. it’s really just for getting pcm audio (still over 99% of all files) from your streamer or computer to this dac. that’s it? yes. well, some people think unison usb sounds very good, too. but how can a usb interface sound different? yeah, we hear you. no pun intended. i want a combined dac/amp! why didn’t you put an amp in here? we did. they’re just in different chassis and costs another $99-149. they’re called “magni 3” and “vali 2+.” the latter of which even gives you a tube! now you have options, instead of a single boring, soon-to-be-obsolete combo box. if modis are so great, why would i step up to bifrost or gungnir or yggdrasil? because you want something big enough to hold down the curling veneer on the fake-bark stereo rack you got on sale at k-mart in 1979. or because you want even higher performance. or upgradability. modis aren’t upgradable. but i heard from a dude on the intarwebs all dacs sound the same! you’re bullshitting us! if it’s your experience that all dacs sound the same, that’s cool. there’s a dac in your iphone or android phone, so you can use that one and save even more cash. schiit modi 3 dac review john darko, darko.audio "the schiit brick is one kick-ass first purchase for anyone looking to get better sound from a consumer-grade computer." "furthermore, the modi 3 comes on as more detailed and more robust sounding than the identically-priced audioquest dragonfly black whose small form factor and super low power draw gives it smartphone compatibility and portability." "the schiit is 100% a homeboy.rarely are dac starting points as compelling as this $99 piece of schiit." see darko audio's video review: https://youtu.be/ih0eqxstbq8 read full review -> schiit audio modi 3 - desktop dac - review ian dunmore, headphone.com "modi 3 is easily the best sounding, most enjoyable and convincing dac i’ve heard in its price-class - and will be installed as my new entry-level reference dac." "as a pure dac, i would rare the performance of, and enjoyment from, the modi 3 above that of its principal competitors (including the grace sdac, topping d10 and d30, odac rev b etc. and the ol dac). and for desktop use, for pcm content, the modi 3 + magni 3/vali 2 combination would, for me, trump the nano idsd black label; especially with more demanding cans - again unless native dsd support, or mqa decoding, was deemed important." "in short, the modi 3 comes highly recommended and is, by some margin, the best entry-level dac i’ve heard.  if you're in the market for a compact, desktop, dac then you definitely want this on your audition list." read full review -> little big man gary alan barker, headphone guru "i have no problems saying that the schiit modi multibit dac is the best sounding budget dac i have heard, it will definitely beat out anything in the sub $500 category and compete favorably with many dacs in the thousand dollar plus group." update november 2019: budget product of the year read full review -> modi multi times, or the modi multibit is good schiit larry cox, positive feedback "i am not returning the modi multibit. the uptick in performance is both noticeable and welcome. there is more color in the presentation, even with a plain wrap computer usb cable. detail is more easily discerned, elegantly presented and more musical to boot." "for now i'm in for schiit, the modi multibit that is. it's a worthy addition to my headphone setup. don't let its modest cost mis-lead you. and, with the tiny footprint, it's hard to beat." read full review -> the basic schiit: modi multibit and vali review alex, metal-fi.com "i firmly believe that this entry level multi-bit dac is one of the sweetest deals in the audiophile world right now, and you would be hard pressed to find a better sounding platform until you hit the $500 dollar plus mark." "to sum up, the schiit modi/vali stack easily earns our highest honor. in fact, if i was in the market for a high performing entry level solution, this would be my personal desktop solution of choice. the level of options coupled with its overall performance at this price level is second to none. it is, as they say, the schiit." read full review -> schiit audio magni/modi dac and headphone amp review christopher coke, mmorpg.com "all of this comes together to make quite an impressive combination. at $99 for the magni, i’m impressed a the value schiit has been able to offer here. the sheer power of the amp at that price is excellent but when you add in the superior craftsmanship and smooth audio delivery, it’s easy to see why its earned so many fans. the modi is another $99, but is another solid upgrade to ensure what you’re feeding the magni is as good as it can possibly be." read full review -> this is some schiit! tlrtechnology.com, jules b "if you’re looking to take your digital hifi music to the next level with an amp you need to feed it a clean, strong signal and the modi 3 has you covered. the schiit audio modi 3 isn’t good for a $99 dac its good for a dac period. it is this reason that modi 3 gets a strong recommendation as a solid foundation at any level of hifi from tlr technology." read full review -> modi 3 review ear-fidelity, pawel szachno read full review -> modi 3+ manual modi multibit manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee built in california and texas home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
