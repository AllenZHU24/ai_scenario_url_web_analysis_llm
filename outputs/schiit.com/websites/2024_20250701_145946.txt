select usa plugeuropluguk plugaustralian plug $1,299.00 out of stock description specs faq reviews downloads spin cds...and seamlessly integrate with streamers and computers. urd is the only cd transport with usb output and two usb inputs. so go ahead. dig up those old shiny memories…and run them right next to your latest streams. cd transport with usb or spdif output urd is the only cd transport that gives you unison usb™ output, allowing direct connection to a usb-input dac. or, choose the included spdif outputs—coax and aes—for easy integration with any system. usb hub for your entire system here’s where things get interesting: you can also connect two usb devices to the urd. yes, urd has two usb inputs! then, choose what you want to listen to—cd, usb1, or usb2—using the standard remote control. now, you can run cds when you feel like it, and stream when you want convenience, all with a dac with a single usb input. convert usb to aes and coax, too what’s more, urd can also convert the two usb inputs into spdif output, for integration with dacs that don’t have a usb input. it’s a versatile centerpiece of an entire digital system. bring your discs and your computer, choose your dac, and you’re ready for anything. super high quality throughout urd starts with a real streamunlimited metal tray-loading redbook cd mechanism—not a cheap computer drive or slot-loader. from there, massive computing power, including four 32-bit microprocessors, and a 100% linear supply, including separate transformers for both the drive and digital sections, make urd a cd transport that stands far above entry-level options. sleek, streamlined design unlike other cd transports, urd is thin and sleek. at 16” wide, 8” deep, and 2” high, it’s exactly the same size as a freya or loki max, and stacks perfectly with them. designed and built in the usa by “designed and built in the usa" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of urd—chassis, boards, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our chassis and transformers are made in california. our pcbs are made in california or nevada, and it all comes together in our san antonio facility. 5-year warranty, easy returns urd is covered by a 5-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. and if you don’t like your urd, you can send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. cd transport formats supported: redbook cd only gapless playback: yes inputs two (2) unison usb™ inputs maximum sample rate/bit depth: 192khz, 32 bits switchable

nope! well, this certainly looks like a cd player. what is it, then? it’s a cd transport and unison usb™ hub. that means, amongst other things, it does play cds, but it only provides digital output. if you want analog output, you need to add a dac. aha. ok. digital out from cds. snore. well, there is the little tiny fact that urd is the only cd transport that provides a unison usb output. wait, what? a usb output from a cd? how does that work? very well! sigh. okay, why don’t you just tell me all the wonderful things urd does? absolutely, here you go. urd is a: cd transport. as in, put in a cd, get digital out via aes and coax. you know, like most transports. but you can also select the unison usb output, which means you can play your cd directly to a usb-input dac. unison usb hub. urd also has two usb inputs that you can connect to other usb sources, and switch between them. this allows you to integrate a streamer or computer into the mix without having a ton of usb inputs on your dac. since most dacs usually have only single usb input, we figured this would be super helpful. usb to spdif converter. urd can also convert those two usb inputs to spdif, and output via coax and aes. wait a sec! so i can plug in my streamer and switch it in when i don’t want to run cds? yes. and i can convert any usb source into spdif for my dacs that don’t take usb? absolutely. and i can compare my streaming services to cds? you’re getting it! so what’s the catch? this thing must be using a crappy drive or something? no. actually, we’re using a streamunlimited real true redbook cd drive with a metal mechanism—basically the gold standard for drives. you’ll see it in products that cost many times what this one does. no computer drives, no slot loads, just a good old tray-loading drive. then it must be crap parts and engineering? nope! in fact, urd has four 32-bit microprocessors inside to manage all the digital switching and format conversions, all run with schiit’s unison usb code—the only usb input that was designed specifically for open-standard audio formats, without the distractions of unicorn formats du jour. it also has a 100% linear power supply with two transformers (one for the drive and one for the digital section, as well as a properly-isolated aes digital output and super-high-reliability usb-c connectors. the chassis is made in usa, from heavy aluminum and steel, with machined aluminum buttons and drawer. there’s gotta be a catch. only one: your source and your dac will need to be uac2. this is the worldwide standard for usb audio, and most dacs these days are uac2 compliant. all of our dacs since the $99 modi 3 from 2017 have been uac2 compliant, for example. some dongles aren’t, and some older dacs aren’t. if you’re unsure, ask your dac manufacturer if they are uac2 compliant. so what if i want just a cd transport? then use urd as just a cd transport. there’s no law against that. or just a usb switcher? weird use, but sure, why not? how about a ddc? again, yes, but why not do cds? what if i don’t have cds? then urd may not be for you. however, if you want to get into cds, now is a great time. prices are low, unlike records. you can stock up on plenty of physical media for the time after skynet takes over and wipes all the streaming files from existence. you know, there are lots of transports out there that are cheaper than urd. absolutely there are. we bet none of them are using an actual streamunlimited cd drive—as in, they might be using some dvd drive for computers, the kind of thing that was closed out at frys in 2014 at $18.99—and we know that none of them have unison usb output or usb hub functionality. and that's fine. there are plenty of choices out there, including not having a transport at all and just doing streaming. your choice! you know, this is a helluva deal for a transport that uses a real streamunlimited cd drive, and has a ton of unique tech, and is small and slim, rather than as big as a 1980's rack-mount product. yes, and there's that perspective too. we hope you enjoy urd! what is an "urd?" in norse mythology, urd is a norn relating to fate in norse mythology. it’s the one looking to the past. in this case, the dim dark past of 1981, and the introduction of the cd. enjoy your retro media! schiit urd: a new era for cds? audio arkitekts “the urd cd transport by schiit audio is set to transform the cd listening experience. by integrating advanced technology into this traditionally basic component, they're offering new hope for the future of cds as a physical medium.” innovative or irrelevant? schiit urd cd transport and ddc review passion for sound, lachlan fennen i can't believe i spent $1,299 on the schiit urd cd transport! forever analog urd manual up
