"schiit is one of those companies whose products have an edge. for rmaf schiit introduced a new flagship dac, the yggdrasil (say that fast three times) that is touted as “the world’s only bit-perfect dac.” to achieve this lofty goal the yggdrasil uses proprietary “adapti-clock” topology combined with vco and vcxo re-clocking. the dac’s analog stage uses differential current-feedback topology with a fully discrete design populated by both jfet and bipolar transistors. for $2299 the yggdrasil delivers a lot of unique technology and flexible functionality. it sounded great driving a pair of audeze lcd-2 headphones." read full review -> a short preview of your next dac zerodeefex "tl;dr: buy this dac*. spot on tonality, perfect timbre, perfect rendition of every freaking detail you could ever want, speed, resolution, i’ve never heard anything like it." "i firmly believe schiit’s claim that the yggdrasil “resets the bar for dacs” to be accurate. without dsd support, without noise-shaping, the yggdrasil shames every dac i’ve had the pleasure of auditioning. forget high res files, i don’t think i’ve ever truly heard 16 perfect bits before. the yggdrasil really kicks ass: gobs of detail, from the particular character of tizzy noise of the tape in a tom petty recording (yes you could hear it), to the quick little breaths (not the big ones) gil shaham takes as he’s getting into something extremely complicated, it’s all there.  perfect tonality, with bass hitting hard and deep, isaac 'dickie' freeman’s voice really comes alive when listening. the sense of space is ridiculous; i can pick out where the audience members are cheering from in live in japan. i think exploring my experiences with my system now that the yggdrasil is gone from my rack is the best way to understand how phenomenal a dac the yggy really is. all of my music feels a little lifeless and i can't find myself enjoying the same recordings that i listened to during my extended audition. details are just missing (i'm straining to find them and coming up short) and that sense of cohesiveness and realism i got with the yggdrasil is just gone. a week and a half after it's gone and i'm a ruined man." note: based on preproduction sample. read full review -> thoughts on a bunch of dacs purrin "just when you think the gen v is good, the yggdrasil is even better. you wouldn't believe how much musical information is contained in those 44/16 files; and just how much lesser dacs leave behind. brings those old or even bad recordings into a new light. monster dynamics, bass that stops on a dime, tight precision, decay and ambient cues that don't suddenly disappear when they are not supposed to. no digital crap. makes me reminisce of vinyl in my youth. the yggdrasil is the 2015 update to the theta v by the same guys. the yggdrasil is really beyond words. the downside? kinda sounds like **** in the first few hours. 24-48 hours at minimum to warm up. one week for best results." read full review -> computeraudiophile yggdrasil review chris connaker, computeraudiophile.com "based on my experience with countless dacs and after spending a couple months with the yggdrasil, i can say without a doubt that this dac is very special. it's one of my favorite dacs available today. in fact, i will happily mention the yggdrasil in the same sentence as some of my other favorites, the berkeley audio design alpha dac rs ($16,000) and the emm labs dac2x ($15,500), when talking to fellow audio enthusiasts. the yggdrasil is one of those products that subtly grabs hold of the listener, yet the listener is the one who can't let go. i couldn't stop listening through the yggdrasil enough to write this review on time." "the yggdrasil has a really solid yet simplistic build quality on the outside and very selective component use on the inside. however, i believe the yggdrasil's performance has much more to do with intellectual property than any other factor. any manufacturer can use identical hardware in a competing product, but only schiit audio has its closed-form filter." "the yggdrasil is a disruptive product that i can't recommend enough to both new and experienced music aficionados. add to cart and enjoy." read full review -> headphone guru paddy carroll "the yggdrasil has an amazing way of reproducing the sound of three dimensional space....breaths taking by the four musicians and movements of the arms and feet are all amplified creating a much more intimate listening experience. it is even possible to hear the clothes that the players are wearing as they perform – movements of the sleeves and trousers! i also got a sense of the size of the concert hall, echoes of sound and microphone placement were precisely picked up which easily created images of the depth of the hall as the sounds are reflected from wall to wall." "in my opinion it surpasses similarly priced dacs like the eximus dp1, chord hugo and arcam fmj d33. it seemed superior even to dacs like the lampizator generation 4. the yggdrasil’s advantages in price to performance peak at around the level of dacs like the bricasti m1 which is an unbelievable achievement when you consider that the m1 is 3 times the price of the yggdrasil. "one of the crowning achievements of this dac is how it can take regular cd quality (redbook) recordings and squeeze every last drop of detail from them. i was floored when i went through my old rock collection." "the yggdrasil sets a new benchmark in price for performance. i believe that it is the best dac on the market for the money." read full review -> the absolute sound robert harley "i don’t know how schiit audio has done it, but the $2300 yggy is in many ways competitive with any dac i’ve heard regardless of price. in some criteria—transient speed without etch, clarity of musical line, whole-body involvement—the yggy is as good as digital gets." "it’s a spectacular performer on an absolute level, and an out-of-this world bargain. the yggy is not just a tremendous value in today’s dacs, it’s one of the greatest bargains in the history of high-end audio."​ read full review -> up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
