reviews downloads okay. let’s blow up this high-end nonsense. here’s your ultra-high-end amplifier, without the ultra-high-end price. welcome to the revolution. no-excuses amp, no-brainer price vidar is nothing less than a no-excuses, exotic-topology, class-ab, linear-supply, microprocessor-controlled, power-doubling, dual-mono-ish, intelligently-managed, drives-almost-anything power amp. no class d, no switching supplies, no fans, no compromises, nothing in the signal path but music—for a three-figure price tag. small size, big power don’t let the compact size fool you—pick up the vidar to get a real feeling for the beefy 600va transformer inside. vidar may be small, but it’s also a powerhouse, delivering 100w per channel into 8 ohms, doubling to 200w per channel into 4 ohms. stereo or mono flexibility combine vidar with a single-ended preamp like saga for a complete system with insane, no-compromise performance—for just a little over a grand. or, run two vidars from a preamp with balanced outputs (like our freya) for true monoblock performance and 400 watts per channel into 8 ohms. intelligent oversight and protection in vidar, a microprocessor oversees important aspects of amplifier operation, from dc offset to over-current and over-temperature faults. this provides stable, safe operation without invasive current-limiting, fuses, or active devices in the power supply path. in english, vidar makes sure it’s operating optimally at all times—and protects itself when it needs to, so you can be assured of excellent performance for a long, long time. designed and built in california by “designed and built in california" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of vidar—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our chassis are made minutes from our facility. our pcbs are done just over the hill from us, or done in norcal. our transformers are also made in california. you get the picture. 5-year warranty and easy return policy vidar is covered by a 5-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. and if you don’t like your vidar, you can send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. power output: stereo, 8 ohms: 100w rms per channel stereo, 4 ohms: 200w rms per channel mono, 8 ohms: 400w rms frequency response: 20hz-20khz, -0.1db,

weight: 22 lbs audio precision apx555 report for vidar so now you think you can do speaker power amps, huh? okay, mr. fashionably unimpressed, i guess it’s news to you that we’ve been doing a speaker amp for a couple of years now. it’s called ragnarok. but that’s an integrated amp that does everything from iems to speakers. vidar is simply our first dedicated speaker amp. plus, we do have a history with speaker amps, back in the dim dark days when there was still some affordable high-end audio. color me still unimpressed. there are a lot of amps out there. yes, there are. but unless you have a wallet that takes a palanquin to carry, you’ve probably noticed that most high-end amps are very, very expensive. when you start using the word “affordable” next to “speaker amplifier,” the choices get really thin, really fast, especially when you also the words “really good,” before those three words. especially when you understand that “affordable” doesn’t mean, “up to $5k,” in any sane universe. so what’s so special about this “vidar” amp, besides the fact it’s cheap? the big deal is that this is a no-compromises design, at a price where there are usually a lot of compromises. vidar uses a dual-mono-to-the-transformer design for the main output power supply (the most important place to use it). it has an exotic, high-speed, fully complementary, all-bjt current-feedback topology (no class d or switching supplies here), and it has no coupling capacitors or dc servos in the signal path thanks to a sophisticated microprocessor oversight system, which also protects the amp—transparently, without fuses or active devices in the signal path—from common fault conditions. or, to put it in “key features” speak: power supply to output stage is dual mono—and this is where it matters. modulation on one supply won’t affect the other. massive overkill power supply topology—separate regulated hv rails to voltage gain and driver stages (not stacked, so no modulation with p/s load). no caps in the signal path, no dc servo in the signal path, nothing but music in the signal path. current feedback topology is amazingly fast (-3db above 1mhz before input filter) and measures well, especially for such a simple stage. linear supply, not switching supply, no high-frequency noise to deal with. class ab output stage, not d. again, no noise or noise-shaping applied. 3 pairs of outputs per channel—1.5x more than typical for this power output. rated power output doubles into 4 ohms. microprocessor oversees all important aspects of amplifier operation: current, dc offset, temperature. protection system uses a “least invasive methodology”—no active devices in signal path, no current limiting, no crowbars—just resistors and relays. no fan, just a massive amount of heatsinking. hmm, i only understood about half of that. is this amp fully buzzword compliant? hell, we don’t know. it is if you think it is. i still only understood a bit of that. yep, engineering is a bitch. we’re really happy that there are other people in the world who understand things like finance, design, philosophy, and business. it’s just that’s not us. and, unfortunately, in engineering, sometimes you have to speak in engineerese. hey, this amp is small for what it is, isn’t it? yes, it is. we worked hard to make the chassis simple and small, so we can do a no-compromises design at a reasonable cost. we used the heatsinks as part of the chassis to simplify its design, so we can put the money in the transformer, output devices, and power supply, rather than in large, flashy cosmetics. but this amp is kinda small… you seem fixated on this. are you feeling inadequate lately? no, i didn’t mean that! i mean, is this really a seriously powerful power amp? yes. its rated power doubles into 4 ohms, which is something you don’t see very often. it has serious power reserves, with a 600va transformer and 40,000uf of filter capacitance—20,000 for each channel. it’s perfectly happy driving difficult loads like magneplanars. unless you have some seriously insanely inefficient speakers and like ear-bleeding volume, this amp will do you just fine. but what if i have insanely inefficient speakers and i wish to suffer hearing loss in the future? then use two of them as monoblocks. of course, to do that, you’ll need a preamp with a real balanced output, like freya. plug a single balanced output into vidar, and it turns it into a 400w/8 ohm mono amp. wait. how does the monoblock mode work? it’s not a mode. it’s just the natural result of driving each channel with one half of a truly balanced signal. that’s why you need a preamp with balanced outputs. and that means real balanced outputs, not just xlr connectors. there’s a difference between xlr and balanced? there can be. if you aren’t using freya, ask your preamp manufacturer if it has true balanced, differential outputs. if it does, you can easily run two vidars as monoblocks. or more, if you want to use them for home theater or something. what? home theater? there’s no reason you couldn’t use 7 vidars, one for each channel, if you have a pre-pro with balanced outputs. or three and a half of them in stereo. or…well, you get the picture. so what happens if i have 2 ohm speakers? you didn’t rate vidar for 2 ohms. no, we didn’t. because speakers that are rated below 4 ohms are pretty rare. the bottom line is that vidar will run 2 ohm speakers, but it may run into its protection and turn itself off. same for 4 ohms when running monoblocks? yes. again, vidar will probably work fine at sane volumes, but at higher output, you may trigger the protection. well, it still runs pretty warm even into 8 ohms. yes, it does. it’s got a decent amount of bias on it. no worries—we have internal thermal sensors that the microprocessor monitors. they’ll turn off the amp if it gets too hot. so what’s a vidar? vidar, in norse mythology, is said to be the strongest of the gods after thor. and no, this isn’t a hint that there’s an even more powerful “thor” amp coming—we just don’t want the copyright battle on that one. vidar is one of the newer generation of gods that survive ragnarok. yep. i know. we’re here all day. schiit audio reference system, part 1 chris connaker, computeraudiophile "the vidar's design will surprise the know-it-all audiophile in that it's class-ab, not class-d. there's nothing wrong with class-d in and of itself, but i've been more underwhelmed than overwhelmed by the performance of most class-d products. in fact, last week i heard a pair of $16,500 class-d mola mola mono amps driving a pair fo dynaudio evidence loudspeakers. myself and three others in the room all thought the amps did an injustice to the loudspeakers and weren't capable of showing what the speakers could do with respect to performance. one aspect of the vidar that must be considered, is its lack of rating for mono configuration into 4 ohm speakers. according to schiit, "vidar will probably work fine at sane volumes, but at higher output, you may trigger the protection." based on my testing with 86 db efficient 4 ohm speakers, i believe the vidar will work without triggering protection for most people using this configuration. i pushed the vidar really hard and was unable to trip its protection mechanism. i didn't go crazy by putting on nine inch nails at 110 db and let it run over the weekend, but i did listen to nine inch nails, hip hop, big band, and some heavy bass at loud levels. at no time did the pair of vidars flinch. in fact, i concluded a listening session by playing marcus miller's intro duction from his silver rain album at what faber acoustical's sound meter app said was a 123.4 db peak, and 11.3 db max. the vidars appeared to have very good control over the speakers, even at very high levels." read full review -> schiit vidar power amplifier marvey (audiophool.org) "in conclusion, the schiit vidar is a fanastic value power amplifier. the bass quality is first rate, comparable with the best. the mids and treble do not quite exude the magic or immediacy of the super high-end amplifiers (costing thousands and thousand of dollars) or epic vintage amplifers (no longer available or in dubious condition). however, the vidar is still more than competent. my hunch is that the vidar will be able to compete with amps at the $2000-$2500 point." read full review -> schiit vidar/saga: an affordable care act for your loudspeakers john darko (digital audio review) dar-ko knockout award winner "with their vidar and saga, schiit turn conventional thinking on its head to lay down a serious challenge to any amplification selling for a coupla clicks north of a thousand us dollars. the point is, schiit lay down the red carpet to a separates approach but without the premium. welcome to the great leap forwards!" read full review -> an affordable audiophile amplifier wows the audiophiliac steve guttenberg, cnet audiophiliac "vidar was a perfect match with the magnepan .7 flat panel speakers, so that's what i used for my first round of auditions. bingo, the best of the .7s sound --  transparency, big as outdoors soundstage, gorgeous midrange -- they were all there, and i noted the treble was better than i've heard in a while. the kef ls50 speakers also loved the vidar, and bass output of this little speaker really surprised me. with kid koala's sampled and synthesized "12 bar blues" cd, the ls50s low-end slam belied their size. pair the vidar with schiit's smaller tube preamp, the $349 saga, and that pair together runs just over $1,000. add a set of $500 elac uni-fi ub5 monitor speakers, and that would be a hell of a system!" read full review -> review: schiit vidar brian hunter, audio-head.com "bass tests proved perhaps the most impressive of the spectrum, where control was exceptional, even at high volumes and heavy load. listening to marcus miller’s miller time from live in america reaction times and shove were outstanding. firm control of the situation was everywhere, with no excess flab to be found. but mids and highs were not to be outdone. the experience of listening to the system is close if not on par with many of the other front ends i’ve heard the tad mes partnered against at audio shows. that’s something considering the least expensive comparison totaled $6k, with higher end offerings topping much more than even that. that smooth purity of energy and tone from the very high end is hinted at here and there along the way." "comparisons to benchmark’s dac3 + ahb2 brought a different shade of pigment to light. while neither combination was particularity colored, the benchmark system was much more analytical in nature. that’s not to say the schiit gear wasn’t detailed (it very much was), but rather the approach from the la budget company was just a tick more organic, and therefore by proxy, a bit easier to listen to. a pleasant natural tone emanates from the freya + vidar combination that even the demanding tad me1 was able to gobble up with tactile and responsive results." read full review -> the neoteric listener - the schiit vidar intelligent power amplifier dean seislove, positive feedback "the vidar's impact on accurately reproducing instruments continued with more complex music, as well. listening to bart schneemann's recording of mozart's sonata for violin and piano no. 25 in f major, k. 377 (k. 374e), the standard inova rendering of this track was lovely, but maybe less captivating than it could be. the vidar improved the discernible elements often associated with a lively and dynamic touch. details, such as a greater percussive impact of the piano keys and an improved clarity of the oboe's tone, heightened my appreciation for the construction of the piece, as well as my overall enjoyment." "in fact, the overall improvement made to my system's sound is enough to garner an easy recommendation. i also liked the fact that the vidar has a microprocessor that regulates current and temperature to keep me from doing something stupid, like blowing it up. the very reasonable cost and the careful attention to build quality is a welcome bonus, as is the option to buy another vidar to use in a mono block configuration." read full review -> latestintech: schiit vidar latestintech "at its price, the schiit vidar isn’t cheap, and you’ll require a preamp to adjust its volume. however, if you consider its quality, components, design, and flexibility, it’s absolutely affordable. also, it’s expandable to the dual-mono mode and has clean power output. vidar isn’t categorised as a low budget amplifier, but it’s difficult to find an audiophile-grade a/b amp at its price. it has excellent build quality, superior performance, and safe operation. it will power almost anything you connect it with, and it’s easy to expand to enhance your system. to conclude our schiit vidar review, we were satisfied with this speaker amp, and we highly recommend it." read full review -> audioreputation: vidar james longman "schiit vidar is not cheap, but if you look at other class a/b stereo amps, you’ll realize that you can hardly get better performance for $700. since this is a power amp (not an integrated amp), you will have to buy a preamp (preferably some schiit preamp) if you don’t have one already. so, don’t forget to take the preamp price into account. schiit vidar is a great choice if you are an audiophile on a budget or if you are trying to find your first entry-level audiophile-grade power amp. it looks great, it’s solidly built and has high-quality components, it can be used in dual mono mode, and it delivers perfectly clean and powerful output. you cannot expect more at this price point." read full review -> schiit audio freya+ preamplifier and vidar amplifier review home theatre review: gene hopstetter read full review -> vidar owner's manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and built in california home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
