only this: mjolnir is only a balanced amp. there are no single-ended outputs. welcome to the wonders of cross-shunt push-pull topologies. no-excuses, end-game balanced amp you won’t find any balanced-to-single-ended conversion or vice-versa in mjolnir. it’s balanced in and balanced out, with a 4-gang rk27 alps volume pot--providing end-game performance for a mid-level price. high power for any headphones high-gain amps can be noisy. this doesn’t matter for low-efficiency orthodynamics, but if you have, say, denons, it may not be ideal. mjolnir delivers both 8w rms per channel, and exceptionally low noise. unique, simple crossfet™ topology mjolnir is the only dedicated headphone amp using a circlotron-style, or cross-shunt push-pull topology. this crossfet™ topology allows us to use only n-channel mosfets, for better matching and lower distortion. it also significantly simplifies the output stage. fully discrete, dc-in and dc-out design mjolnir uses high-voltage jfets running on 90v rails to achieve low distortion with only a single voltage gain stage and no feedback. it’s also dc-coupled at both input and output, with a precision dc servo and relay protection for all outputs. 5-year warranty mjolnir is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. that’s 5 years. yes. five. compare that to the competition. 15-day satisfaction guarantee don’t like mjolnir? no problem. call us for an ra and send it back for a full refund, minus 5% transaction fee, within 15 days of receiving your amp.when was the last time you spent a couple of weeks in an audio store? with your own equipment?

say “mule-ner.” we’re sure it’s not quite the correct norse pronunciation, but hey, it’s close enough. what the heck, why such a stupid name? it ain’t stupid. mjolnir is thor’s hammer. which is a very appropriate name for a headphone amp putting out 8 watts rms per channel into 32 ohms (or 5w into 50 ohms, for most popular orthos.) i thought you guys already had a powerful amp. why another? because we like the near-infinite headroom a powerful amp can provide. and we like the noise floor of solid state. consider this: even though mjolnir puts out more power than lyr, it’s quieter than asgard. go ahead and use it on super-sensitive cans! whoa, a serious answer. what’s with that? aliens. definitely aliens. we’re all pod people now. okay, fine, another balanced amp. who cares? wait a sec, bub! this isn’t just another balanced amp where they throw two of the same gain stages in and run one inverted. it isn’t a balanced-to-single-ended-to-balanced amp either. it’s a real balanced amp from input to output, and it’s the only dedicated headphone amp based on a circlotron-style topology. what the hell is a circlotron, and why do i need it? “circlotron” was the first commercial name for a cross-shunt push-pull output stage. at the time, it used tubes. we use jfet inputs and mosfet outputs, so we call our topology crossfet™. crossfet™? are the fets angry? no. they’re thrilled. n-channel mosfets and p-channel mosfets usually don’t match too well (and that’s putting it mildly.) crossfet allows us to use only n-channel mosfets, for better matching, and for an elegantly simple output stage with great performance. so, besides this crossfet thing, what you got goin for ya? high-voltage jfet front-end, with low distortion from an open-loop, single-gain-stage design. you’re speaking too much engineerese! we know. sorry about that. too much time behind the bench. you don’t get a chance to see those alien pods sneaking up on you. but, to translate: a high-voltage front end allows us to have better performance in the range the jfets operate in. this means thd of less than 0.006% at 1v across the audio band, as compared to asgard’s 0.06%. oh crap, you’re meter-readers now! there’s nothing wrong with using measurements to improve designs, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to start using op-amps and bragging about parts-per-million thd. we still have ears. why no single-ended outputs? the circlotron-style topology is inherently balanced. you can’t get a single-ended output from it easily. to do that, we’d have to have an entirely separate gain stage, or sum the outputs, or have some kinda wacked out output-stage-switching arrangement—all of which we tried, and decided they screwed up the basic performance of the amp too much. so, no single-ended, sorry. that’s cool, i’ll just use an adapter for my single-ended headphones, right? one word: boom. well, not actually, but you will trigger the internal protection. you know, this sucker runs warm? yeah, and let us refer you to the asgard . . . high fidelity magazine marek dyba “…not even the best speakers ever gave me such incredible insight into the music as mjolnir driving lcd3 did.” “not only the bottom played by this new schiit is so amazing, spectacular, but the treble as well. even though some people claim that audeze cans sound bit dark, but in fact there is absolutely nothing missing in the treble, that is extended to the very top, very detailed but also very rich, dense and smooth…details are exposed, presented in a more distinct way, music starts to… shine with that wonderful ‘magical’ halo, that makes you open your eyes wider, and your heart bit fast when a stick hits a cymbal, or triangle, or bell and suddenly you can ‘see’ the air vibrating, and hear the decay suspended in this air almost indefinitely.” “what about midrange?…there was nothing special about it – by that i mean that it was exactly as it was supposed to be – palpable, rich, colorful, with great resolution and so on – fabulous in one word, like in the real life. i can’t remember such a palpable, intimate contact with human voices as relayed by lcd3 driven by mjolnir.” “many companies after creating such a great performer as mjolnir would call it the end-game performer, place a sticker with at least 2k usd on it and just kept delivering and checking their bank account. but that not the way of schiit audio…mjolnir already seems to be a complete, amazingly well sounding device, and it’s hard to imagine what could get even better.” read full review -> audiophile perspectives quarterly sir denis eton-hogg “indeed the schiit may appear at times, depending upon the structural counterpoise of one’s favored transducer, to be ever so slightly dogmatically vigilant in rendering the tone colour of a multitude of musical instruments and human voice.” of course, this person and journal are entirely fictional. however, this is a real review from an experienced reviewer. thank purrin at changstar.com for the quote. read full review -> positive feedback al chieng "getting involved with the music is important, and i found that whatever music i played through the mjolnir, it pulled me in. one of the amp's strengths, besides the dark background, was keeping up the rhythmic pace and timing." "in the end, this amp gives you the tools to make up a serious listening package. schiit audio definitely put time in creating something that is capable of making someone happy for the foreseeable future. what is even better is that both guys are determined to provide the best customer service and support." "thor's hammer delivers and strikes a blow for those looking to go balanced and have a sneaking suspicion that a little more power is necessary to make your headphones come alive." read full review -> head-fi summer 2013 buyer's guide jude mansilla "the mjolnir is awesome. it's very powerful, yet exceptionally quiet (in terms of background noise). with 8w rms per channel, it'll drive pretty much any headphone (not including electrostats, of course). though it'll drive just about anything, what i have plugged into it pretty much all the time are a variety of planar magnetic headphones. my favorite headphone to pair with the mjolnir so far is the audeze lcd-3, the pair of them making for a forceful, highly resolving, world-class powerhouse of a system." read full review -> mjolnir owner's manual 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
