power, more bettermultibit for the massesfully modern, meet old skoola decade of progress about who we are schiit started in 2010 with the introduction of the original asgard and valhalla headphone amplifiers. since then, we’ve introduced dozens of other unique, no-compromise, affordable, made-in-usa products, from dacs to preamps and power amps. today, you can create an ultra-high-performance audio system (or systems) from our product line—without requiring a second mortgage to pay for it. what makes your gear special? really three things: first, unique technologies you can’t get anywhere else. second, true no-compromise high-end design. and finally, affordability—because, let’s face it, audio’s a lot less enjoyable when you’re eating ramen to pay for your gear. let’s break it down a bit: unique technologies for superior sound whether it’s digital or analog, schiit delivers unique technologies you won’t find anywhere else. we’re the leader in multi-bit digital audio, having created entirely new architectures for d/a converters usually used in medical or defense products. we’re also the leader in discrete analog design, with unique topologies not based on any op-amp, like nexus™ and continuity™. what’s more, we employ a full-time ph.d to lead us forward with entirely new algorithms, such as those in our true multibit™ digital architecture and unison usb™ audio interface. when you choose a schiit product, you’re getting something that isn’t out of a manufacturer’s “reference design.” you’re getting something that we crafted specifically for excellent sound and performance. no-compromise high-end design at the same time, we go all-out when it comes to implementing these unique technologies. like relay-ladder volume control in our preamps. this literal best-in-the-world approach delivers unmeasurable distortion, even when measured on an apx555, as well as perfect channel matching. or top-of-the-line 2sc/2sa devices throughout our line, from preamps to power amps. or 1% matched jfet inputs on nexus topologies. silicon and film capacitors, 0.1% resistors, and exotic non-inductive metal strip resistors in power amp outputs continue the theme. and, almost everything we make is dc in and dc out, with no capacitors in the signal path. investing in schiit means you’re getting true no-compromise design with the best parts, something that’s reflected in the length of our warranties. affordable products that hold their value finally, everything we make is designed to be affordable. we don’t waste money on milled-from-a-solid-block chassis or over-the-top cosmetics that have nothing to do with sound. instead, we invest in complex tooling and stamping, as well as efficient production engineering, so you end up with a beautiful, super-solid piece of gear that you could pass on to your children. heck, check the resale values on our products for a pleasant surprise! when you choose schiit, you’re getting the best performance-to-price ratio, period. aaaaand… we do this while making everything in the usa. and by “making,” we mean making. our chassis and transformers are made in california. our pc boards are mainly made in california, too. and everything comes together in our san antonio or corpus christi production facilities in texas. want more info? read the full story on head-fi—all 200,000+ words of it—here or, you
