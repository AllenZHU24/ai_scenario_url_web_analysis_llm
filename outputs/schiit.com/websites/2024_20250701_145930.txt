select usa plugeuropluguk plugaustralian plug $249.00 ships 1-3 days description specs faq reviews downloads go ahead. do things with valhalla 2 that you’d never attempt with other otl tube amps. run low-impedance headphones. use iems. valhalla 2 is a very flexible tube amp! tubes made flexible while most tube otl amps are really only designed for 300 ohm senns and 600 ohm beyers, valhalla 2 stretches to include headphones that you’d never expect to use with a tube amp. many people use valhalla 2 with sensitive, lower-impedance headphones as well. a complete desktop preamp valhalla 2 also has preamp outs and a gain switch. preamp outs let you connect your powered monitors, to give them some of what some people call “tube magic.” the gain switch gives you better control of both output level and impedance, for better matching to your headphones. it's easy to build a complete desktop system around the valhalla. not your father’s tube amp if you’re expecting syrupy, tubby, euphonically colored tube sound, you’re in for a shock. valhalla 2 is exceptionally accurate, neutral, and resolving, without being strident or etched. designed and built in california by “designed and built in california" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of valhalla 2—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our chassis are made minutes from our facility. our pcbs are done just over the hill from us, or done in norcal. our transformers are also made in california. you get the picture. 5-year warranty valhalla 2 is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. that’s 5 years. yes. five. which is up to 5x that of our competition, if you weren’t so hot at math. note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.” one exception: the tubes. those we cover for 3 months. 15-day satisfaction guarantee try valhalla in your own house for 15 days. if you don’t like it, simply send it back for a refund, minus a 5% transaction fee. try spending 15 days in an audio store. they’ll kick you out. unless you buy them donuts. maybe. maximum power, 300 ohms: 600mw rms per channel at less

an otl tube amp? are you nuts? no, not completely. at typical listening levels, with high efficiency headphones, the low output impedance and higher current capability of valhalla 2 mean you might be surprised by the sound. what makes valhalla 2 different than most tube amps? we infuse each of the electrons in valhalla with special powertrode ions, which gives the output super-strength. each milli-amp of current in valhalla is actually worth many amps of current in other amps. are you done now? want to give us a real answer about how you made valhalla 2 a “super otl” amp? okay, fine, we’ll take our pills. ahem. there’s really no magic. we just spent a long time optimizing both the input and output topology to maximize current delivery, and to reduce output impedance. this entailed quite a few tweaks to the common-cathode front end, adding a new negative voltage rail and current source to up the overall gain, and also changes to the white cathode follower output. hey, you’re making that up, too! no, actually, we aren’t. to really understand our serious answers, you’ll need to learn engineerese, i’m afraid. what headphones are valhalla really good for? valhalla is still going to be at its best with high-impedance headphones like the 300 ohm sennheisers and 250-600 ohm beyers. with up to 60v p-p output capability, it can light up high-impedance headphones. does the volume control adjust the preamp outputs? yes. can i turn off the headphone outs when i’m using the preamp outputs? the preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. unplug your headphones to use the pre outs. how do i switch the gain? there’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp. is valhalla rollable? yes! the standard 6n1p input tubes can be subbed out for any 6dj8/6922/ecc88/ecc85/6bz7 types, including nos, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc. does this have a muting relay, like all your other amps? no. the slow turn-on and turn-off characteristics of tubes and limited current capability means there's no muting relay—which is the same for pretty much every tube otl headphone amp out there. while there is dc on the output at turn-on and turn-off, it is on the order of 100mv into 32-ohm headphones. if you are concerned about this, unplug your headphones before turning the amp off, and wait 30 seconds or so after you turn valhalla 2 on to plug in. i was told that tube amps are all about euphonic distortion and that you’re a bunch of crazy money-grubbing arseholes because you make tube amps. have you ever heard a tube amp? no, seriously. we are serious. have you ever heard a tube amp? no, i don’t find it necessary, having done the calculations for exact current and voltage delivery to my headphones to achieve a long-term safe listening level, and knowing the distortion floor of my particular transducers— okay, we see where this is going. bottom line, we make both highly-capable, completely-neutral-by-the-measurements, inexpensive solid state amps, and wacky tube and tube hybrid amps. why? because some people like solid state, and some people like tubes. you know, like some people like camrys and some like corvettes. like some people like budweiser, and some people like bordeaux. amazing thing, the world, full of so many different experiences and so many different opinions of them. is one right, and another wrong? if so, who is the arbiter? bottom line, if you don’t agree with our approach, there are tons of other options out there. have fun, and we hope you find one that fits your desires perfectly. neoteric listener positive feedback, dean seislove "...the valhalla 2 delivers a tight, controlled sound. there's real substance to the notes, and, yes, it is resolving...after a long session listening again to the led zeppelin catalog, i remarked to myself that this is an amp that engages you for hours on end." "all three schiit products [lyr 2, bifrost uber, valhalla 2] are stellar accomplishments that should please even the fussiest headphone audio enthusiast." read full review -> the little schiit headphone amp makes a big sound cnet audiophiliac, steve guttenberg "...my single-word description of the sound would be " beautiful." sure, it's clear and clean, but the valhalla 2 imparts a sense of beauty to the sound of well-recorded acoustic instruments. there's more substance to the sound, it's more organic and full-bodied, which is, after all, the way those instruments sound in real life." read full review -> master & dynamic mh 40 meets the schitt valhalla 2 single ended triode amp and preamp positive feedback, ken micallef "the master & dynamic mh 40s paired to the schitt valhalla 2 made a surprising two-fer splash in my brain. lp after lp i found myself reveling in the details of the music and fully immersed in the deep listening experience i was enjoying. the valhalla 2's bloomy midrange and thankful gain switch helped amp-up the m&d mh 40s, the resulting combination of stout dynamics, general overall neutrality and a warm yet uncongested midrange to lower bass presentation enabling the ears, drawing me in, each album a joy. "at a combined price of us$750, i can't imagine another headphones/amp combination providing this level of pure musical enjoyment. and when given the option to tube-roll the schitt to further personalize its sound, the pair provides exceptional quality and value." read full review -> pure tube joy tim bathras schiit valhalla 2 or asgard 3 -- which should you buy? currawong valhalla 2 manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and built in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
