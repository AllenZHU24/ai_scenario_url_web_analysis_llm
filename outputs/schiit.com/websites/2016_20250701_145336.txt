lyr 2 is a complete control center for your desktop system, with preamp outputs for powered desktop speakers, as well as a gain switch for use with virtually any headphone. amazing flexibility for all your headphones order lyr 2 with tubes, and discover what a high-power tube hybrid amp can do. or get lisst and go 100% solid-state. or do both! no other amp (well, except mjolnir 2) offers you this unparalleled flexibility. you also get gain switching and a 100% regulated heater and high-voltage supply that makes lyr 2 fully ready for efficient headphones and most iems. and you'll have tons of power—our dynamically adaptive output stage transitions seamlessly from class a to class ab, for excellent overall efficiency. from iems and orthos to active monitors lyr 2 offers two gain settings. the gain of 1 is good for most sensitive headphones, including efficient on-ear models and many iems, while the gain of 8 is ideal for inefficient orthodynamics and high-impedance headphones. in addition, the preamp outputs can easily be connected to powered speakers, for a complete desktop system. roll your own sound like lyr, lyr 2 lets you "roll" many different tube types to your own preference. use 6bz7, 6dj8, 6922, ecc88, 2492, and many other tube types to get your perfect sound. or choose lisst for a 100% solid-state, high-power amplifier. made in usa by “made in usa,” we mean made in usa. the vast majority of the total production cost of lyr 2—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our board house is 20 minutes away from our office in newhall. our chassis guys are just over the hill in the valley. 5-year warranty lyr 2 is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. that’s 5 years. yes. five. which is up to 5x that of our competition, if you weren’t so hot at math. note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.” one exception: the tubes. those we cover for 3 months. 15-day satisfaction guarantee try lyr 2 in your own house for 15 days. if you don’t like it, simply send it back for a refund, minus a 5% transaction fee. try spending 15 days in an audio store. they’ll kick you out. unless you buy them donuts. maybe. on b stock when we have products with minor cosmetic flaws, we will sell them here as "b-stock". if you choose the b-stock option to save some money, please note that it is not eligible for the 15-day return. however, the full warranty applies. frequency response: 20hz-20khz, -0.1db, 2hz-500khz, -3db maximum power, 32 ohms: 6.0w rms per channel maximum power, 50 ohms: 4.0w rms per channel maximum power, 300 ohms: 660mw rms per channel maximum power, 600 ohms: 330mw rms per channel thd: < 0.01%, 20hz-20khz, at 1v rms, gain = 8 mode (worst case, stock tubes) imd: < 0.01%, ccif at 1v rms, gain = 8 mode (worst case, stock tubes) snr: > 98db, unweighted, referenced to 1v rms, in gain = 1 mode crosstalk: < -65db, 20 hz-20khz output impedance: 0.7 ohms (high gain), 0.3 ohms (low gain) gain: 7 (16.9db) or 1 (0 db), via rear switch topology: dynamically adaptive class a/ab, noninverting, hybrid tube/mosfet, single voltage gain stage, dc-coupled input and output protection: standard muting relay for delayed turn-on and fast turn-off power supply:  two internal power transformers, five internal regulated rails, with over 30,000uf of filter capacitance power consumption: 30w size: 9 x 6 x 2.25” weight: 6 lbs all measurements made on a stanford research sr1+ audio analyzer hey, this looks just the same as the old lyr! isn’t this just the same schiit in the same box for a higher price tag? no. and the price tag is the same. thanks for noticing so we can point that out here. so what did you change? a lot of things. first, a regulated 180v power supply for the tube stage, as well as separate regulated supplies for the current sources and dc servo. this allows us to offer a significantly lower noise floor than the original lyr. second, regulated supplies for dc heaters. again, lower noise floor. a refined dynamically adaptive output stage that reduces high frequency distortion. and a new layout that allows for more optimized grounding. so why didn’t you put all that crap in lyr? development improves the breed. and surface mount. without surface mount components, all that crap wouldn’t fit in lyr 2. it certainly didn’t fit in lyr. i hate your humor, why can’t you be serious? because “audiophile” does not have to mean “born with a stick up your ass.” plus, people without a sense of humor usually need a psychologist shipped to them with every product. we have not successfully developed a portable or automated psychologist, and our boxes are not large enough to fit a real one into. what about the tubes? can you roll ‘em? lyr 2 uses two 6bz7 dual triodes, and yes–you can substitute any 6dj8/6922/ecc88 type tube, including nos, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc. due to the dc heaters, we do not recommend using 6n1p tube types, or any tube that needs more than 415ma heater current. what is this lisst voodoo? we put tubes into a industrial press and apply 650,000 tons of pressure, which compacts them into a solid-state device. just tell me what a lisst solid state tube is, already! it’s a pair of depletion-mode mosfets in a tube-sized can. that’s it. we’re not trying to replicate a tube. there’s no transfer function trickery going on. that doesn’t tell me anything! if you were an engineer, it would. in short, lisst is a dual solid-state gain stage that runs at tube voltages. it can simply replace a tube in the lyr 2 circuit. but it’s not trying to be like a tube. plug them in, and lyr 2 is a solid-state amp. so does it sound like a tube? we ain’t touching that one. you tell us. are you saying that lyr 2 is now quiet enough to run iems? many of them. although lyr 2 will never be as quiet as asgard 2 or magni 2, it’s pretty darn quiet in low gain mode. and really—think about what putting 6 watts directly to your eardrums means. is that such a great idea? why the hell do you need a 6 watt headphone amplifier for iems? you don’t. but you might want it for your orthos. lots of people have lots of different headphones. no, seriously, why do you need a 6 watt headphone amp, period? why the hell do you need 400 horsepower? why the hell do you need bacon-wrapped hot dogs? why the hell do you need anything that’s fun and exciting in life? face it, you don’t need anything. you should renounce all your worldly possessions and become a monk. i was told all amps sound the same. aren’t you bullschiiting us? if you believe that, there are plenty of options that cost a lot less than our stuff. why waste your money? go buy something else for $39, or use your ipod. so can i leave my headphones plugged in all the time, or do i have to do the unplug-and replug thing every time i turn lyr 2 off and on? you can leave them plugged in all the time. lyr 2 has a muting relay which delays output on first turn-on, and mutes the output on turn-off. does the volume control adjust the preamp outputs? yes. can i turn off the headphone outs when i’m using the preamp outputs? the preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. unplug your headphones to use the pre outs. how do i switch the gain? there’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp. what is this marketing bullschiit known as a dynamically adaptive output stage? it’s an ancient teutonic magic trick, known only to 4 people in the world. it was passed down by dieter burnhard iii to mike moffat through direct mental transfer. no, really. it’s a current-sensing adaptive output topology which allows the amplifier to dynamically adjust to the headphone load. the primary benefits are essentially single-ended class-a operation for high-impedance headphones, moving seamlessly to push-pull class a and finally into class ab as current needs increase. this provides much higher overall efficiency. that doesn’t help! i’m sorry, we only speak engineerese here. positive feedback writer's choice award 2014 dean seislove "i compared the schiit combo with other headphone amp/dac solutions. travel size contenders included the light harmonic geek out, centrance dacport lx, the aforementioned adl x1, and the devilsound dac v2.1. the larger amp/dacs used included the audioengine d2 and peachtree audio inova integrated...the lyr 2 and bifrost uber dac simply bests the competition in every aspect that matters. the schiit opened the soundstage dramatically to fill the headphones with space and sound, as if the musicians stopped playing in the backstage waiting room and started again on the stage." "all three schiit products [lyr 2, bifrost uber, valhalla 2] are stellar accomplishments that should please even the fussiest headphone audio enthusiast." read full review -> audiophilia (grado gs1000e/lyr 2) martin appel "as i mentioned earlier, the musical fidelity v-cans headphone amp provided a serviceable level of performance but the lyr 2 moved the bar much higher and i now understood why grado named their headphones the statement. the headphones sounded three dimensional, dynamic with a full frequency response. imaging was excellent without any edge or artificiality. the subtleties of the music were clearly expressed with detail that didn’t shout at you. the combination was warm and sumptuous." read full review -> cnet audiophiliac steve guttenberg "a quickie comparison with the new marantz hd-dac1 headphone amp/digital converter perfectly illustrated the lyr 2's strengths. with my oppo pm-1 headphones the lyr 2 uncorked superior dynamics, brawn and heft; the marantz was thinner, dimensionally challenged and much less fun to listen to. in fact, try as i might, i couldn't find anything the marantz did better. the lyr 2 has soul -- oodles of it -- whereas the marantz was a major disappointment." "the lyr 2 had no noise issues whatsoever with my ultimate ears ue 900 in-ear headphones, and the sound quality was miles ahead of what i heard from a yamaha a-s801 integrated stereo amplifier's headphone jack. the lyr 2 sound was fuller-bodied and more natural sounding than the a-s801's." "hey, just because your ferrari 458 italia pumps out 570 horsepower and has a top speed of 202 mph doesn't mean it can't cruise at 55. the lyr 2 similarly allows listening at whatever volume suits your mood, and brings out the best sound from any headphone." read full review -> hifipig recommended product janine elliot "on fleetwood mac’s songbird track there is a good sense of the recording space with the natural reverb on the piano being large and natural sounding, another area that can leave some cheaper dacs found wanting. for those with 700 quid to splash, then i reckon you’d be hard pushed to beat this duo when used with headphones." "the soundstage is good, wide and deep with an ever so slight feeling that things are being slightly exaggerated. instruments remain nice and stable and you get a good idea of where they are seated in the mix. this is an easy to listen to preamplifier with the slight warming effect i noted previously and it has to be said that it performs very well for the money schiit are asking you to pay. there’s reasonable amounts of detail coming through when compared to the reference and there’s good tonality…erring on the side of smoothness." read full review -> lyr 2 owner's manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
