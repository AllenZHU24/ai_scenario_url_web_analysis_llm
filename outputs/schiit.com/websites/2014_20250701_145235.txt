for $79? you’re fulla schiit!” you might be saying. and you know what, you’re right. that’s fulla, and it’s not only a combined dac and headphone amp, it’s also the least expensive quality dongle-dac/amp on the market, with a knob for volume control—connected to a real live analog volume pot, not a volume control chip. total convenience just plug fulla into virtually any computer’s usb port and you’ll be enjoying great tunes instantly. no drivers, no fiddly software, no confusing volume buttons—on either mac or pc. it also works (with some caveats) on linux, iphones, ipads, and android devices. plug it in, attach your headphones, and turn it up. done! a dang good dac like modi, fulla uses a cm6631 usb 2.0 receiver and the ak4396 digital to analog converter—not antique 1.1 or an integrated dac with headphone drivers built in. the ak4396 is one of the best-measuring, most capable digital to analog converters on the planet, used in systems that cost many times the fulla’s price. plenty of power for most headphones after the dac, a gain stage using precision thin-film resistors and film capacitors filters and boosts the output, up to 300mw into 32 ohms. this means plenty of power for most headphones, together with a vanishingly low noise floor and low output impedance that make fulla great for iem use. made in usa. no, really. by “made in usa,” we mean made in usa. the vast majority of the total production cost of fulla—chassis, boards, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. solid warranty and easy return policy fulla is covered by a 1-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. and if you don’t like your fulla, you can send it back for a refund, minus 15% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. frequency response: 20hz-20khz, -0.1db, 2hz-200khz, -3db maximum power: 16 ohms: 400mw rms per channel 32 ohms: 300mw rms per channel 50 ohms: 220mw rms per channel 300 ohms: 40mw rms per channel thd: <0.004%, 20hz-20khz, at 1v rms imd: <0.005%, ccir snr: >101db, a-weighted, referenced to 1v rms crosstalk: >-67db, 20 hz-20khz output impedance: less than 0.4 ohms gain: 1.5 (3.5db) usb receiver: c-media cm6631a bit depth and sample rates supported: 16/44.1 to 24/96, including 24/88.2 dac: akm ak4396 with analog devices ada4610-based filter stage output stage: analog devices ad8397 high-current rail-to-rail amplifier headphone output size: 1/8", unlike all of our other amps power supply: via usb, with +/- 5v rails via high-current negative rail generator with inductor filtering and local regulation power consumption: 0.8w typical size: 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.45” weight: 3 oz wait, wait, wait! a $79 dongle dac? with a volume knob? and a custom aluminum and steel chassis? how the hell did you pull this off? by making about a billion at a time, not trying to throw the kitchen sink into the thing, and by not marking it up to hell and gone. and no dealers. if it sold through dealers, it would be about twice the price. so is this gonna be great with my headphones? for most headphones, yes. it’s not going to be the top choice for hard-to-drive orthodynamics, but most full-size headphones are fine. as are most iems. does it have a ton of power? well, you’re not going to arc-weld with it or anything. it’s a reasonably powerful, versatile little dac/amp, putting out about 5x-10x the power of a typical headphone jack on a mobile device. how about high-impedance headphones, 300 ohms and 600 ohms? this is our most voltage-limited amp, which, in english, means it will be least capable to drive high-impedance headphones. however, even for 300 ohm senns and 600 ohm beyers, it’s still going to be tons better than the output of an iphone or computer. so this is just plug and play on windows and mac? yes, in case you missed the phrase, "plug and play on virtually any computer" in the product description, it is plug and play on windows and mac. or, to be more pedantic, "connecting fulla to any windows xp, vista, 7, or 8 machine, or to any mac from os 10.6 to os 10.10, and selecting it as the sound output device in control panel or system preferences, will result in sound being produced from the fulla device, without drivers being required." what about connecting to linux computers, chromebooks, iphones/ipads, android phones, ps4, smart toasters, google glass, espresso machines, etc? in order: linux: any distro supporting usb audio class 1 or 2 should be fine. plug and play. chromebooks: we've had it work with many intel-based chromebooks, but this isn't a complete survey. ymmv. iphones: you'll need ios 7 or 8,  the magic overpriced apple cable and a power source (hub or battery, or, for full lols, wyrd.) this is covered in the guides/getting connected section of the site, with links to cables, hubs, etc. android: you'll need android 4 or 5, software for 4, and a power source. as above, this is covered in the guides/getting connected section of the site. ps4: we've had customers report our usb dacs work on a ps4, so fulla should as well. should. smart toasters, google glass, espresso machines: come on, you know we're kidding here, right? what comes in the box, besides the fulla? do i get a cable with this? yes, we supply a usb 2.0 4” mini-cable. can i use a fancier cable to get better sound? you can do whatever you’d like, including dancing by the light of the full moon and making small, preferably non-living sacrifices to the audiophile gods. no, seriously. we are being serious. i’m asking specifically about the cable. as long as it’s a usb 2.0-rated cable, 2m or less in length, terminated with a mini usb plug on one end, you can use it, sure. and it’ll sound better? yes, and so will taping $100 bills to your headphones. or sending them to us. we prefer the latter. you’re messing with me! just a little. why do you call it a “dongle-dac/amp?” because that’s what it is. just like a wall-wart is a wall-wart. we don’t fancy stuff up with terms like “precision crafted ultraminiature high-end headphone maximizer” or “separate external power supply.” does this thing actually have a real volume control? that is, a potentiometer? this isn’t an encoder connected to a chip, right? right. this is a real potentiometer. i thought you guys said you were allergic to combined dac/amps! we also think a two-chassis dongle dac would look pretty stupid. think of the rubber bands! no, seriously. this is a combined dac/amp. what’s up with that? what’s up is simple: at certain price points, a combined dac/amp makes sense. making a $200 combined dac/amp doesn’t make a lot of sense when we have magni and modi, but a $79, take-anywhere, easy-to-use one-box solution is a no-brainer. what the hell is a fulla? a very funny name. hey, be thankful, we could have called it the dingleberry. do i have to ask you to be serious all the time? yes. pretty much. so what’s fulla in norse? fulla is a goddess, “bountiful”, and a healer. and if you’re looking to relax to some great tunes on the go, the schiit fulla can definitely be a bountiful healer. and that’s not fulla schiit. fulla schiit manual 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
