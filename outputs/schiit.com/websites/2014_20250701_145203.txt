about | schiit audio $0.00cart login spam productsguidesfaqnewsaboutcontact principles how we do it on "deals" about who we are schiit got started when two audio industry veterans decided it was time to shake things up a bit. the two audiophiles are jason stoddard, formerly of sumo, and mike moffat, formerly of theta. together, they have designed dozens of audio and a/v products, from the andromeda iii to the cobalt 307 to the ds pre and angstrom 200. so, yeah: fully balanced differential power amplifiers, fully discrete i/v conversion stages, audiophile d/a converters, relay-switched stepped attenuator volume controls in preamps. the first dts home theater surround processor on the market . . . we’ve done a ton of stuff. why start with headphone amps? a realization. in the old days, audiophiles went up the food chain from the table radio to the console stereo to separate speakers the size of refrigerators and monoblocks that would cook a cat. today, nobody starts with a table radio. everyone—and we mean everyone—starts with headphones screwed into their ears. headphones are now the standard. and what happens when someone decides to lose the earbuds and get some serious headphones? they quickly find that their smartphone, tablet, or laptop won’t drive them. or sounds like crap. or both. now it’s time for them to get a headphone amplifier. which is where we come in. of course, we aren’t going to stop with headphone amps. we already have a full line of dacs, there's the ragnarok integrated and mani phono preamp, and you can look forward to more two-channel products in the future. so what makes your products special? mike moffat separately aligns each molecule of every jfet, using a special absolute zero containment suit…er, well, no. what makes them special are three things: simple, discrete circuit topologies almost everything we make uses simple, discrete design on the analog side, and innovative bitperfect management systems on the digital side to avoid asynchronous sample rate conversion. we use class a designs where practical and single gain stages when possible—and, when we use op-amps, they are high-quality, low-noise models in especially cost-constrained designs. designed for the real world the real world is a complex place. that’s why we design both with advanced instrumentation (specifically, two stanford research sr1 audio analyzers, one kitted out with their ultra-low-jitter reference and analysis tools) as well as listening tests with a wide variety of today’s popular headphones, as well as highly resolving planar and dynamic loudspeaker systems. built to last—but sensibly priced all of our products are overbuilt. they’re intended to be something you can pass down to your children. that’s why we cover them with up to a 5-year warranty. but, at the same time, our stuff is affordable, because we’ve taken great pains to make it easy to manufacture—so easy, we can make schiit in the usa for prices similar to chinese products. so, why don’t you check out our schiit? 5-year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
