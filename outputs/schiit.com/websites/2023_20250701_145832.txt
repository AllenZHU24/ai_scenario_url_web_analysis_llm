discrete headphone amp and preamp on the planet—with an optional internal unison usb dac. total confidence for all headphones no matter what headphones you have, you’re set with magni unity. it’s dead-silent with the most sensitive iems, and has tons of power for power-hungry planars. and don’t worry about your favorite cans—magni unity’s overcurrent and dc correction systems help ensure they’re totally safe. one box for your entire desktop with the optional internal unison usb™ dac card, magni unity is a one-box system for your entire desktop. plug in via usb-c for ultimate streaming quality, connect the preamp outputs to powered monitors (or a mini speaker amp like rekkr) and you’re set for both headphone and speaker listening. new tech—proven by listening magni unity debuts our new super-linear, high-precision current-feedback discrete topology—an exotic, bespoke amplifier stage unlike anything available from the competition. coupled with the best parts, from a custom, sorted alps potentiometer to silicon and film capacitors and 0.5% thin-film resistors, magni unity delivers better sound, as confirmed by our blind listening panels. designed and built in texas by “designed and built in texas" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of magni—chassis, boards, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. in the case of magni, the chassis are made in california, the pcbs are made in nevada, and it all comes together at our corpus christi, tx facility. 3-year warranty and 15-day return policy now 50% more warranty! magni unity is backed by a 3-year parts and labor warranty—and covered locally by a company that’s been in business for over 13 years. and, if you don’t like your magni, you can still send it back for a refund, minus 15% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving your amp. specs that matter power: plenty for all headphones except a handful of the hardest-to-drive ones (we’re talking he6, tungsten, stuff like that) noise: inaudible on all headphones and iems distortion: unmeasurable at normal listening levels; 1000x lower than the typical headphones you're using heat: amp gets slightly warm

single-box desktop solution when equipped with the optional internal unison usb™ dac. so, yeah, “unity.” is this really different than previous magnis? yes. it debuts our new, super-linear, high-precision current-feedback topology that increases performance by 10db relative to previous discrete magnis…aaaand it’s the first modular magni ever, with an optional internal dac. why this rather than any other $1xx product? simple: magni unity is the only fully discrete headphone amp and preamp at this price. fully discrete means no off-the-shelf op-amps; it means our own exotic current-feedback, low-loop-gain architecture that we’ve been perfecting for the last half-decade. and it’s designed to be modular, with an optional unison usb dac module, for a single-box, non-obsolescent desktop system. translate the above into english. can you sell me on what’s in it for me? sigh. schiit audio has exactly zero people with the title of “sales,” and still exactly zero people who have “sales” as their responsibility. so we don’t get very salesy. try. argh. okay. let’s break it down: discrete, not integrated—no off-the-shelf amp amp chips here: magni unity is the only fully discrete, exotic-topology, current-feedback, low-loop-gain amp selling for 3 figures and starting with a “1.” it uses insanely high grade stuff, from 0.5% thin-film resistors to silicon and film capacitors, and the power output is no joke. upgradable, more future-proof design: magni unity is the only headphone amp and preamp anywhere near its price using a modular design, with an optional internal dac card that is upgradable for the future. super high power—and not only from a wacky balanced jack: with 2.5w on tap from a standard single-ended output jack, plus three gain levels, including negative gain for iems, you’re set for pretty much every headphone out there. 100% linear power supply: no switching noise, total reliability, and a ton of filter capacitance—something many others charge more for! complete safety and confidence: the overcurrent and dc correction systems—both, by the way, 100% transparent and out of the signal path—mean your most treasured headphones have the highest level of protection. better efficiency and looks: our (usa-made) advanced-form stamped chassis is super-efficient (no piles of aluminum from milling operations), eliminates visible fasteners and looks way sexier–and is now available in brushed aluminum! designed by listening: we regularly do blind listening panels, both internally and externally, and they have consistently chosen low-feedback, current-feedback products, including magni unity, over integrated and voltage feedback designs. longer warranty: 3 years, not 1 or 2. we’ve been in business more than 13 years, we’ve built well over 1 million products, and we stand behind what we make. wait. are you saying it sounds better than op-amp designs? to us, yes. to many, yes. to you…you tell us. wow what a tease. it’s not a tease. here’s what we can tell you: in blind listening, our panel consistently picked current-feedback, low loop-gain devices like magni unity over op-amp and discrete current feedback designs. this should be looked at with proper skepticism—but hey, it’s the same standard as the pharmaceutical companies use to submit data to the fda for the drugs you take, so hey maybe not so bad. argh why you go so hard? we really don’t. here’s the thing: we believe in what we do. we believe in it based on blind listening, testing beyond “one number to rule them,” and some of the most extensive engineering experience in analog audio design in the world. we believe in it enough that we killed magni heretic, an op-amp based design, because this measures within 2db of that product—but with 30db of feedback rather than 130db, and because it was consistently chosen as sounding better. i see this is $119 now. gonna blame inflation? actually, if we went by inflation, a $99 magni in 2012 (when it was first introduced) is $134 today. so we’re well under inflation. and that’s while adding switchable gain, preamp outputs, and modular design. well, it’s $189 with the dac. yep, and a magni/modi stack in 2012 was $198, or about $266 today. so we’re saving you almost $80 relative to 2012, for a much better product, in a single box. that’s called “progress.” something a ton of companies have forgotten. so is magni unity powerful enough for inefficient, planar magnetic headphones? magni unity has tons of power—specifically 2.5w rms per channel (that’s 2500mw, rms, both channels driven—check others for “peak” or other sneaky claims) at less than 1% thd. how is it for iems? with a -10db negative gain setting, you’re totally set. what about the dac card? is it junky? no. in fact, it’s a proper unison usb™ dac, using our own usb receiver, designed for one thing and one thing only: spectacular usb sound. backed up by an ess 9018 dac, opa1656 op-amps, and optimized filtering using film capacitors and precision thin-film resistors, it’s in the same class as the standalone modi+—just with a single usb input. all right then. what’s this about dc coupling? magni has no capacitors in the signal path—that’s what we mean by dc coupling. this eliminates any sonic effect a capacitor in the signal path might have on your system. so you probably cheaped out and left the protection off these amps, or something stupid like that, right? no. in fact, magni unity has the most advanced protection we’ve ever included in an affordable amp. this includes completely transparent current sensing and overcurrent protection (great when someone accidentally plugs in a trrs headphone with a wonky adapter) and dc correction, which protects your headphones in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure. magni unity sounds great! why would i buy any of your other amps? seriously, you really don’t need to. hence the “no excuses.” but, you know, different people like different things, and they may want to try out tube amps, or balanced amps, or class a/continuity™ amps. i see the aluminum top option is back. is this painted “aluminum” or real aluminum? this is real brushed aluminum, not painted, just like the good old days! thank the stamping wizards in california for figuring out a standardized, repeatable process for such a complex part. i still don’t like the name “unity.” then call it magni 5. why? because it’s the 5th generation. and it’s screened on the pc board. what the hel is a magni? in norse mythology, magni was one of thor’s sons. and you’re mixing your norse metaphors. magni unity manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee built in california and texas home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact
