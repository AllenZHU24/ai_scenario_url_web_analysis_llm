(ragnarok and yggdrasil get 4 days each). we also keep very close tabs on any service and support needs, so you can rest assured of years of great sound. and—it bears mentioning—we believe that close-coupled, local control of all of the aspects of production delivers better products. that's why we design and produce our stuff here in the usa, with the vast majority of parts cost going to us-based companies manufacturing in the us. we need all of that clarification in there because some people have played games with what "made in usa" means. when we say it, it means that our chassis guys are right over the hill in the san fernando valley, our transformers are made here in california, our boards come from the east coast (of the usa), and we design, assemble, and test everything here in valencia, california. why don’t you check out our schiit? want more info? check out the full story—all 160,000+ words of it—here on head-fi. or, if you're really into it, you can even buy the book. up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee made in usa home | products | guides | faq | news | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
