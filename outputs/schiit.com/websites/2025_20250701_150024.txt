technobabble and buzzword bingo for a sec. here’s what tyr is: a monstrous, old-skool, crazy heavy, over-the-top mono speaker amplifier. it uses the best of today’s and yesterday’s technologies to create something totally unique—and it has enough power to run almost anything. please note: "mono" means "one channel." you need two tyrs for stereo. beyond overbuilt 55 lbs. 12 lb choke. 160,000uf filter capacitance. 24 150w toshiba output devices. 7 internal power supply rails, including hv boost rails that uses unique discrete cfp regulators. sounds like overkill? it is. tyr is our most insane amplifier ever, designed for driving difficult speakers without breaking a sweat. unique nexus™ and continuity™ topology tyr is the ultimate expression of both nexus and continuity. in other words, this is a balanced, differential amplifier with a unique discrete, current-feedback gain stage, coupled with continuity™ output topology that eliminates transconductance droop. in tyr, we’ve refined continuity even further, resulting in a cooler-running amplifier. back to the past one of the keys to tyr’s performance is it’s huge inductor—literally the same size as the power transformer. this custom-made inductor is the “choke” in the “choke-input power supply.” this is a super old-skool technique you don’t see anymore, because chokes cost a mint and some people think banks of capacitors are more visually impressive. intelligent oversight and convenience like all of our amplifiers, tyr is managed by a microprocessor running custom firmware. it monitors all operational parameters, from bias to temperature to dc, and protects the amplifier in case of any fault, for near-bulletproof reliability. add the ability to put the amplifier into low-power “standby” mode on the front panel and switchable balanced and se inputs, and tyr is our most convenient amp ever. designed and built in the usa by “designed and built in the usa" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of tyr—chassis, boards, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our chassis and transformers are made in california. our pcbs are made in california or nevada, and it all comes together in our san antonio facility. 5-year warranty, easy returns tyr is covered by a 5-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. and if you don’t like your tyr, you can send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. power output: 8 ohms: 200w rms per channel maximum 4 ohms: 350w rms per channel maximum frequency response:

can’t, it’s a mono amp. you mean i have to buy two of these? absolutely. unless you’re using one for a center channel or something. which is pretty crazy, but we’ve seen crazier schiit out there. like what? no comment. okay, fine. what about this 350w rating into 4 ohms? why doesn’t it double into 4 ohms? i thought that was good. here’s a horrible truth: no amp doubles its output into 4 ohms. none. nada. zip. some might get close, but when you factor in transformer resistance and saturation, choke resistance, emitter resistance (especially in a differential amplifier where that’s 2x a factor), then an actual doubling into 4 ohms aintgonnahappen.com. i didn’t understand a bit of that. please simplify. hey, we don’t understand interior design or how to design something that goes to mars. why don’t you summarize those for us in 200 words or less, too? okay, i get it. but take a stab. fine. here we go: we chose to rate tyr nearer its actual output into 8 ohms to get that magic 200w number. usually we take the 4 ohm result and divide it by 2 to get the 8 ohm rating. the reason we chose to do this is largely because of the choke, which, although it has other benefits, adds some dc resistance to the power supply. this, combined with tyr’s differential topology, means we don’t quite get 400w into 4 ohms. we’re ok with this. does it run into 2 ohms? sure. eventually you might hit the thermal or overcurrent protection, but tyr doesn’t care too much what it’s connected to. so if the choke limits output, why’d you put it in there? because it stores a ton of power for transient needs, and smooths the power supply dramatically. in fact, running the output rails thru a choke means a 20+db reduction in ripple. we didn’t really need to put much output filter capacitance on it at all, but we chose to do so, because, you know, overkill is overkill. no switching supplies? no. no class d? no. class a or ab? neither. continuity™. what is this continuity™ thing, really? continuity is our way of compensating for transconductance droop when the amplifier transitions out of class a operation and into class ab, and to help solve the mismatch between npn and pnp output devices. huh? i didn’t understand all of that. okay, let’s break it down like this. continuity allows us to run less bias than class a, and yet still have the amp act more like class a even once it’s outside the class a operating region. so this is like aegir and jotunheim 2? kinda in-between, but closer to aegir. the implementation of continuity on tyr is unique, using a single output “corrector” with a more efficient “sense” device so that tyr doesn’t have to run as hot as aegir, but it’s not the “supercharger” arrangement used in jotunheim 2. this gives us both higher efficiency and higher linearity, which we think is a pretty neat trick. okay, so it’s a sliding bias scheme. nope, it is a unique output stage that uses both npn and pnp devices on both rails, and selectively turns on additional devices to compensate for transconductance droop outside of the class a bias region. okay, so it’s a sziklai output stage. nope, the output stage has no gain. why is this amp so expensive? big transformer. big choke. big heatsinks. lots of output devices. lots of weight. stuff like that. but see below for a different perspective. are you guys nuts? fully linear power supply, choke-input, 24 output devices, this is super-cheap for what you get! how do you do it? by making lots of them and not overcharging. and direct sale. same as all our other stuff. do i need to run a balanced input to this thing for max output? nope, nor do you need a balanced input for best quality. nexus™ is input-agnostic. feel free to run single-ended all the way up to the amp; it won’t make any difference. can i run both balanced and single-ended to the amp? yes, and you can select one of them via a rear switch. i bet the power switch is on the rear too. yes, it is, but you can put tyr in standby using the front button. this standby mode de-biases the output stage and reduces the standing power requirements to only about 5-6 watts. who is tyr in norse mythology? tyr is sometimes thought of as a norse war god, but also the god who presides over law and justice. we thought this appropriate for this over-the-top, powerful, impactful…and yet still controlled and composed, amplifier. schiit audio tyr monoblock power amplifiers the absolute sound, robert e. green "the tyrs offer striking power and definition in the bass and middle bass. with the bass-capable cabasse murano alto speakers, the reference recordings rutter requiem’s organ part was extraordinarily convincing. and the low plucked notes on eight string cello religion positively exploded out of the speakers if the volume was up. orchestral music had scale and scope: the opening of the proarte mahler second (dallas symphony, mata conducting) was properly hair-raising. the whomps in the opening of the proarte dallas (mata again) recording of the rachmaninoff symphonic dances really whomped." "and yet when the music turns delicate, the tyrs go right along and present delicate fine detail in a most graceful form. using the jern speakers, with their remarkably silent (cast-iron) enclosures, the third movement of kind of blue, say, sounded the very definition of sonic refinement. and back to the mahler second, the laendler (second) movement’s delicate string sound was exquisite in its realism." read full review -> stereophile recommended components 2024 stereophile, john atkinson "it offers high power, is not fazed by low impedances, sounded superb with the three pairs of loudspeakers that i used for this review, and is competitively priced. strongly recommended!" read full review -> schiit audio tyr monoblock power amplifier stereophile, john atkinson "while i described the audible differences i found between the schiit tyr and the two amplifiers with which i compared it, i must admit that these differences were relatively minor. i find it increasingly difficult to characterize the sounds of modern solid state amplifiers. unlike many tube designs, which have a readily identifiable sonic character, solid state amplifiers are benefiting from a process of convergent evolution that pushes noise and distortion below audibility. "schiit's tyr is a perfect example of such a thoroughly modern amplifier. it offers high power, is not fazed by low impedances, sounded superb with the three pairs of loudspeakers that i used for this review, and is competitively priced. strongly recommended!" read full review -> finally! the schiit audio tyr's are here! | first impressions new record day tyr manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and built in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
