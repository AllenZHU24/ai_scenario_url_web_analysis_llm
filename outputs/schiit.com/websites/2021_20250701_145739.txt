volume control, which you can use in pure passive mode, or run it through a 6n8s hybrid tube buffer. saga+ even includes a custom remote control. saga+: easiest relay-switched volume, ever the benefits of a relay-switched stepped attenuator for volume are clear. compared to a potentiometer, they give you essentially perfect channel matching and near-unmeasurable distortion. however, some preamps with relay-stepped attenuators confuse you with buttons and screens. not saga+. saga+ has a volume knob that works just like a volume knob—just grab and turn. and if you use the remote control, the motorized potentiometer changes to match the remote setting. it’s your choice: passive or active go ahead. run saga+ in passive mode for a convenient remote-controlled passive preamp that’s ideal for many systems. if you need to drive long cables, switch it to the hybrid tube buffer—a serious buffer running on 200v rails with vanishingly low distortion. perfect companion to our dacs want a remote-controlled system to interface your digital gear with the rest of your system? stack saga+ and bifrost (or any other of our dacs) for a true no-compromise remote-controlled system. designed and built in california by “designed and built in california" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of saga+—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to us companies manufacturing in the us. our chassis are made minutes from our facility. our pcbs are done just over the hill from us, or done in norcal. 5-year warranty and easy return policy saga+ is covered by a 5-year limited warranty that covers parts and labor. one exception: the tubes. those we cover for 3 months. and if you don’t like your saga, you can send it back for a refund, minus 5% restocking fee, within 15 days of receiving it. hybrid tube buffer stage: frequency response: 20hz-20khz, -0.2db, 3hz-200khz, -3db thd: <0.001%, 20hz-20khz, at 1v rms imd: <0.001%, ccir (active stage)

plus additional 1.25" h for tube weight: 6 lbs apx555 report for saga+ how is saga+ different than the original saga? it’s really just a few things: saga+ has a motorized pot that tracks the remote control volume, whereas saga did not; which provides a continuous physical reference for the volume level. saga+ uses dc heaters for the tube buffer stage, which provides a lower noise floor when in buffer mode. saga+ uses our new “fastenerless” chassis design for a sleeker overall look. why would i need a preamp? if you’re using a power amp without volume control, you’ll need a preamp. the preamp allows you to control volume, switch inputs, etc. aha. so what’s so special about your saga? lots of things. but let’s start where you probably aren’t expecting us to: in the philosophy. yes, philosophy. because in the past 20 years or so, audio gear has gone into full gold-plated bentley/60’ private yacht/$120mm beach estate mode. as in, prices are completely and utterly insane. go ahead. look around for a remote passive preamp, and check the prices. now add a tube stage. oh, wait, there aren’t any of those, so check out remote controlled tube preamps. ouch, part 2. and then start looking at preamps that use a sophisticated, perfectly-matched relay-switched stepped attenuator instead of a volume pot or cheap volume-control chip, and we’ll excuse you so you can go scream at the injustice of the world. and then there’s saga+, at $399. so how do you make it so cheap? by making a ton of them at a time, by using automated surface-mount assembly, and through smart design that doesn’t need a ton of hand-work to solder and route wiring. and by selling direct. no magic. so what’s this about it being passive or active? how does that work? passive preamps are great if you have short cable runs and high-impedance inputs to your power amp. on the other hand, active preamps give you the ability to run longer cables and drive low-impedance inputs on some power amps. saga+ is both. switch it to passive mode to bypass the tube buffer, or switch it to active mode to use the tube buffer. it’s up to you. and this bizarre hybrid tube buffer? what’s that? there are plenty of tube buffers out there, but ours is unique. it’s actually a hybrid push-pull tube buffer, featuring a 6n8s dual triode tube and a pair of bjts (bipolar junction transistors), with a unique transconductance-equalizing network that pairs the tube and transistor more seamlessly, and helps cancel distortion. the result is a buffer that measures insanely well—better than some solid-state stages! i don’t care what it measures like, i care what it sounds like! yes, and some people care what it measures like, too. in our opinion, it both measures and sounds great. of course, we’re biased. and this relay-stepped attenuator thing? yeah. it’s cool. unlike a potentiometer, it gives you perfect channel matching down to the lowest level of the volume knob. and, the knob on the front of the preamp acts just like a normal volume knob—it stops at the bottom and top of its travel. no endlessly spinning encoders here. just the same easy-to-use knob you’re used to, coupled with sophisticated microprocessor control. but i don’t want to deal with tubes! then you need saga s, the solid-state saga. it also saves you $100. but i want just a passive preamp—can’t you make a version like that? yes, and other people want just a tube buffer, or they want a preamp with gain, or they want a preamp with a dac input, or they want a preamp with a phono input, or they want a preamp that’s based on a different kind of tube, or they want a preamp that’s based on a different kind of transistor, or they want a preamp without a remote, or they want a preamp with an app for a remote, or they want a preamp with bluetooth, or a thousand other things. while we hope you like the saga, and that it fits your needs, we can only build them one way. that’s one of the reasons it doesn’t cost like a good used car. hey, i want balanced inputs and outputs! then you need freya+, saga+’s big sister. so what’s a saga? saga is a seeress, or a goddess associated with wisdom. once you get off the beaten path in norse mythology, it starts getting a bit murky like this. but we do think you’ll find saga+ a wise choice in a system needing a preamp. audio-head: a four-way schiit shootout brian hunter from a 4-way blind comparison of saga s, saga+, freya s, and freya+: "the saga + fell about halfway in-between the saga s and the best performing pre, the freya + (also the most expensive). piano sections from queen’s don’t stop me now were placed within the soundscape with intent and appeared as a clean, unobstructed duplicate of a well mic’d instrument. treble resolution was effectively conveyed in superior manner with a touch of overall analytical tendencies, especially for a tube-friendly amplifier. if the saga + was a retail store, it would be called sharper image."
