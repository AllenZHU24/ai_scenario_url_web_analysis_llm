iems? orthos? with a tube otl amp? are you nuts? no, not completely. with the low output impedance and higher current capability of valhalla 2, you might be surprised what headphones you can run with it. now, that isn’t to say that it’s going to be able to drive he-400s or lcd-xs with the authority of, well, anything else we make. but it won’t fall on its face and lay there twitching like valhalla did. did valhalla just lay there twitching? actually, no, it never twitched. but all of our amps just lay there. but some of them glow. and that’s pretty cool. okay, enough silliness. what makes valhalla 2 different than most tube amps? we infuse each of the electrons in valhalla with special powertrode ions, which gives the output super-strength. each milli-amp of current in valhalla is actually worth many amps of current in other amps. i thought i said enough silliness! you did. but we weren’t done yet. are you done now? want to give us a real answer about how you made valhalla 2 the “super otl” amp? okay, fine, we’ll take our pills. ahem. there’s really no magic. we just spent a long time optimizing both the input and output topology to maximize current delivery, and to reduce output impedance. this entailed quite a few tweaks to the common-cathode front end, adding a new negative voltage rail and current source to up the overall gain, and also changes to the white cathode follower output. hey, you’re making that up, too! no, actually, we aren’t. to really understand our serious answers, you’ll need to learn engineerese, i’m afraid. so what does that mean? in simpler numbers: 2-8x lower output impedance, 8x lower distortion, 2x more current delivery, and lower noise. in simpler terms: while valhalla was marginal-to-bad with iems and low-impedance headphones, valhalla 2 is much more versatile. it’s not the be-all and end-all, but it’s now a much more well-rounded amp. what headphones are valhalla really good for? valhalla is still going to be at its best with high-impedance headphones like the 300 ohm sennheisers and 250-600 ohm beyers. with up to 60v p-p output capability, it can absolutely light up 300 and 600 ohm headphones—delivering almost a full watt into 300 ohms (!) however, it's now also perfectly capable with a wide variety of low-impedance dynamic designs, and has enough power for some high-efficiency planars. does the volume control adjust the preamp outputs? yes. can i turn off the headphone outs when i’m using the preamp outputs? the preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. unplug your headphones to use the pre outs. how do i switch the gain? there’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp. is valhalla rollable? yes! the standard 6n1p input tubes can be subbed out for any 6dj8/6922/ecc88/ecc85/6bz7 types, including nos, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc. does this have a muting relay, like all your other amps? no. the slow turn-on and turn-off characteristics of tubes and limited current capability means there's no muting relay—which is the same for pretty much every tube otl headphone amp out there. while there is dc on the output at turn-on and turn-off, it is on the order of 100mv into 32-ohm headphones. if you are concerned about this, unplug your headphones before turning the amp off, and wait 30 seconds or so after you turn valhalla 2 on to plug in. i was told that tube amps are all about euphonic distortion and that you’re a bunch of crazy money-grubbing arseholes because you make tube amps. have you ever heard a tube amp? no, seriously. we are serious. have you ever heard a tube amp? no, i don’t find it necessary, having done the calculations for exact current and voltage delivery to my headphones to achieve a long-term safe listening level, and knowing the distortion floor of my particular transducers— okay, we see where this is going. bottom line, we make both highly-capable, completely-neutral-by-the-measurements, inexpensive solid state amps, and wacky tube and tube hybrid amps. why? because some people like solid state, and some people like tubes. you know, like some people like camrys and some like corvettes. like some people like budweiser, and some people like bordeaux. amazing thing, the world, full of so many different experiences and so many different opinions of them. is one right, and another wrong? if so, who is the arbiter? bottom line, if you don’t agree with our approach, there are tons of other options out there. have fun, and we hope you find one that fits your desires perfectly. positive feedback: neoteric listener dean seislove "...the valhalla 2 delivers a tight, controlled sound. there's real substance to the notes, and, yes, it is resolving...after a long session listening again to the led zeppelin catalog, i remarked to myself that this is an amp that engages you for hours on end." "all three schiit products [lyr 2, bifrost uber, valhalla 2] are stellar accomplishments that should please even the fussiest headphone audio enthusiast." read full review -> cnet (audiophiliac) steve guttenberg "...my single-word description of the sound would be " beautiful." sure, it's clear and clean, but the valhalla 2 imparts a sense of beauty to the sound of well-recorded acoustic instruments. there's more substance to the sound, it's more organic and full-bodied, which is, after all, the way those instruments sound in real life." read full review -> master & dynamic mh 40 meets the schitt valhalla 2 single ended triode amp and preamp ken micallef "the master & dynamic mh 40s paired to the schitt valhalla 2 made a surprising two-fer splash in my brain. lp after lp i found myself reveling in the details of the music and fully immersed in the deep listening experience i was enjoying. the valhalla 2's bloomy midrange and thankful gain switch helped amp-up the m&d mh 40s, the resulting combination of stout dynamics, general overall neutrality and a warm yet uncongested midrange to lower bass presentation enabling the ears, drawing me in, each album a joy." "at a combined price of us$750, i can't imagine another headphones/amp combination providing this level of pure musical enjoyment. and when given the option to tube-roll the schitt to further personalize its sound, the pair provides exceptional quality and value." read full review -> valhalla 2 manual up to 5 year warranty 15-day money-back guarantee designed and assembled in usa home | products | places | guides | reviews | about | contact | cart | terms & conditions | privacy policy | google+ || copyright © schiit audio. all rights reserved.
