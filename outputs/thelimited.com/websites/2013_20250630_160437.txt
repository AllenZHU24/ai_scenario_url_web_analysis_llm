type of pending bank charge used to check an account for validity or approve funding for a purchase you attempt to make. a merchant may pre-authorize an amount before you make a purchase (such as a thelimited.com order), then submit a final charge later (such as when your thelimited.com order ships to you). that final charge amount is often different from the merchant's pre-authorized amount. another type of pre-authorization charge is for a purchase that was approved but that won't be posted to your account until later (such as for an item that does not ship right away because it's on backorder). keep in mind, a charge may be pending for a few days, which essentially holds the pending funds for the intended purchase but does not charge them permanently. once the permanent charge is posted, the pre-authorization charge will "fall off" your account. (this can take up to 3-5 days.) contact your banking institution if this does not occur. overcharges: if you are overcharged for an item, notify an associate in-store or call customer service and you will immediately be refunded the difference between the advertised price and the overcharge. questions? for additional details, please contact us at 1-877-ltd-1963 (1-877-583-1963) or email us. about us store locator our company careers contact us site map press customer service order tracking shipping information returns & exchanges international shipping the limited credit card gift cards size chart hot right now event dresses exact stretch pants little black dress pencil skirts womens suits pants for women skirt suit womens spring dresses legal privacy ca privacy policy legal notices follow us email sign-up stay in the know on new arrivals, trends, events and more! sign up © 2014, limited stores, llc http://www.thelimited.com/sizes?cid=tops
