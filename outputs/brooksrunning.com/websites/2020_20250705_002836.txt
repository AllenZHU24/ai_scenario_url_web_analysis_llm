title : subtitle : font color : black we live by the following: 1 running is a gift. run happy. every day with a run is better. every run brings you closer to your best self. and you end every run in a better place than you started. 2 we do one thing: build great running gear. when you focus on what you do best, you do it better. our goal is to make each run better than the last. this guides every engineering choice we make. 3 we're obsessed with the body in motion. we engineer our gear in the lab, but we bring it to life on the unique, real-world humans who will wear it. this is the result of tireless biomechanical research with runners of every size, strength and experience. but most of all, it’s the result of listening. 4 we sweat every detail. our process is simple: create solutions for runners, test them over miles, assess feedback and repeat. every groove in the soles of your shoes, every inch of fabric in your gear and every single stitch has a reason to exist. if it doesn’t improve your run, you won’t see it in our gear. 5 the planet is our home. more than 100 million people run outside, so it’s critical we care for the world we share. that means working to minimize our environmental impact, creating positive social impact, and being transparent about areas where we can do better. all the while, we give back and lift causes that get people moving. 6 we're runners, too. this is as much for us as it is for you. our offices have locker rooms. we run at lunch. in between meetings. pretty much anytime we can. put simply, we make the best running gear on the planet because we want to go running in it. welcome to brooks running: put one foot in front of the other and then repeat! at brooks, we’re passionate about our daily run. running is primal; we were all born to run. it is the most inclusive sport the world has ever known. we think about our first toddling steps as a kids – free, joyous, fun. years later we live for that feeling, and on a great day, running still delivers it. we are fortunate, because since 2001, we’ve been able to focus exclusively on the pursuit we love more than any other. we challenge ourselves to make the best running gear in the world because we want to run in it, too. our brand aspires to reflect the truth in running. technology is only valid when it helps you run. customization is only worthwhile if it improves function before form. narratives are only useful when they connect with you and inspire you. the proof is in the run, not marketing speak. when we deliver on our promises, you have a better run. let’s celebrate together the transformative power of the run. and let’s shine a spotlight on those who inspire us not just to run, but to be better people as a result. run happy! jim weber, brooks running ceo get to know us better we're proud of who we are and where we come from. read on to learn more. our company our history run happy promise if you’re not happy, we’re not happy. take our gear for a 90-day test run. free returns free returns customer care run happy promise returns track your order shipping info contact & support shop women's shoes men's shoes women's apparel men's apparel sports bras egift cards fit & sizing shoe finder bra finder sports bra fit guide size charts register my brooks meet brooks careers social good corporate responsibility press releases community inspiring stories brooks booster club inspiring coaches blog catalog sign up today for new arrivals, sales, and limited-edition releases. it's the next best thing to signing up yesterday. enter your email sign up twitter facebook instagram pinterest privacy ccpa terms accessibility statement supply chain transparency interest based ads fraud protection sitemap © 2021 brooks sports, inc
