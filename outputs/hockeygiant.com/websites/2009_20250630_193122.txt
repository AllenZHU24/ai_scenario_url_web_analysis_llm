range of top brands including bauer, ccm and mission. we also have a great range of replacement inline wheels and other accessories.senior inline hockey skatesjunior inline hockey skates sizes 5 & underrecreational inline & quad skates a proper fit for skates should fit 1-1.5 sizes smaller than your street shoes (except mission).  toes should barely touch the toe cap, while having no more than 1/4 inch of space in the heel.  when finished lacing skates up, skates should feel snug with the foot resting flat on the foot bed.  when sizing children, follow the above methods while allowing 1/2 size extra for growing room.  most skates use this formula except mission skates, which run true to shoe size.  a poor fitting skate can create bad habits and breakdown prematurely while holding back skate performa nce. choosing the correct skate size is important. going too big will result in blisters and a noticeable decrease in skating ability due to a lack of ankle stability. a strong stride comes from having a boot working in unison with the foot of the player. consistent foot pain is common in players that use skates they have outgrown. the bones in the foot are cramped and put under considerable pressure with each stride. the tightness of the boot leads to a loss of circulation, limiting the function of the foot. us skate sizing guide shoe size wmn nike bauer ccm rbk easton
