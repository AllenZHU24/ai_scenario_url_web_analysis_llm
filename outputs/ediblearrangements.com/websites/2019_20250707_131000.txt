that they’ll remember for months to come. whichever edible® fruit arrangement you pick out, they’ll receive juicy fresh fruit in a beautiful display they won’t want to wait to enjoy. unique thank you gifts thank the teachers, service professionals, and community members who make a difference in your life with unique thank you gifts that are special and treasured. you can opt to send pineapple drip cakes® made from real pieces of pineapple and decorated to look like a festive cake. after your gift recipient takes pictures of the beautiful treats, the most difficult decision they’ll need to make is deciding if they want to share them with others. thank you gift ideas unlike holiday gifts that may seem more obvious, it can be a challenge to find the right thank you gift that expresses your gratitude, especially if you don’t really know the person’s preferences or tastes. you want to give them something that just about anyone would truly enjoy. that’s when sending an edible® gift makes a lot of sense. who can resist a box of decadent chocolate dipped fruit™ lovingly wrapped in a beautiful gift box that arrives just in time to break up the mid-day slump? if you’re looking for some of the best thank you gift ideas, look no further than our delectable collection of edible® thank you gifts for discovering many unique, loving, and delicious thank you gifts that can stir up your imagination. thank you gifts on a budget if you’re on a limited budget, that doesn’t mean you need to settle for a less-than-amazing thank you gift. skip sending stale crackers and wrapped shelf stable meat. instead, opt for an innovative display of fresh fruit that is both juicy and refreshing. with gifts starting at just $29, changing specials featuring seasonal fruit selections, and affordable dipped fruit™ gift boxes starting at $35, edible arrangements® offers several ways to say thanks without breaking the bank. sending the right thank you gift isn’t about the cost of the present but how much they’ll love the gift. related collections good luck gifts just because gifts i'm sorry gifts congratulations gift anniversary gifts sign up for promotions and special offers.
