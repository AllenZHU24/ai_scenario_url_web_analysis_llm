we use 100% real chocolate in all of our dipped fruit arrangements and products! our fruit is dipped in either gourmet semi-sweet or white chocolate. what type of strawberries do you use? we know fruit! that's why we use albion strawberries, which have a consistently sweeter flavor than most strawberry varieties. albion strawberries are typically darker in color than other strawberries, both internally and externally. do your products contain nuts? some of our fruit arrangements and boxes of chocolate dipped fruit have crushed or sliced almonds, so there are nut products in our preparation areas. we cannot guarantee that a gift will not have come in contact with nuts or nut oil. we recommend that you take the necessary precautions based on any related allergies. do your products contain milk?

yes; we never send personal information, such as your credit card number, over the network in a way that is readable to anyone but us. we encrypt your information and send it over the internet using ssl (secure socket layer) technology. i think i may have been charged twice. can you help? absolutely. the first thing you should do is check to see if the charge you are seeing is actually a temporary hold, or pending transaction. if this is the case, you have not actually been charged. credit card transactions are authorized in two steps. in the first step, the payment gateway says “i want to charge $xx to card y.” if the card has these funds available, the card company places a provisional hold on those $xx and responds ok back to the gateway. along with that response, the card company sends the gateway some account information (such as the cardholder address). the gateway then performs the second part of the validation, checking this address against the billing address you supplied. if this match fails, the gateway tells both us and the card issuer. the funds that were placed under hold are never captured—you will not be charged. however, it’s important to note that some card issuers release these held funds in a batch process, typically one that runs overnight. because of this, you may see the held transaction appearing in your online credit card statement for a day or two. the time is takes to release your funds is dependent entirely on your bank or credit card company. if you still have any questions about this, please give us a call at 1-877-363-7848. where can i apply to work for edible arrangements®? think you have what it takes to wow us and our guests? we’d love to work with you! to find out more about open positions at a local edible arrangements® store, please contact your local store directly. need help finding a store?

unfortunately, there is a nationwide shortage of helium, which may affect the availability of balloons in some areas at certain times. you can read more about the helium shortage here. why doesn’t my arrangement have exactly the same amount of fruit as the photo on the website? our arrangements may vary in the exact fruit counts due to produce size variations throughout the year.  each fruit has a peak season, which may result in larger than average produce during that time; similarly, there are seasons when the fruit may be smaller than average. to ensure that the arrangement’s design remains uniform, our fruit experts® work within specified fruit count ranges for each fruit type when building each arrangement. this gives our highly trained staff just enough flexibility to ensure that the arrangement is perfectly designed, no matter what size the fruit is at that point in the year. how long will the fruit last? our fruit arrangements are sold at the peak of freshness. we recommend that you enjoy your edible arrangement® right away. if that’s not possible, you should keep the original wrapping, and refrigerate immediately upon receipt. once it has been removed from the original wrapping, you should remove the fruit from the skewers, store it in an airtight container, and refrigerate immediately. our chocolate dipped fruit is exceptionally fresh, and should be consumed immediately. if that’s not possible, you should keep the original packaging, refrigerate immediately upon receipt, and enjoy within 24 hours of receipt. does your fruit contain preservatives? no. our fruit is all natural. no preservatives are ever added. where can i find information on buying an edible arrangements® franchise? thanks for your interest! please visit www.eafranchise.com to learn more about purchasing an edible arrangements® store location, or call 888-727-4258 to speak directly with an edible arrangements® franchise development consultant. how much is the delivery fee?
