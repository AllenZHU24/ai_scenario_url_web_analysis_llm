"having an idea for doing something better and making it happen - even though it appears impossible. that's still my dream." james dyson engineer building the future. engineering icons inspire us. in 2017, we announced our second uk technology campus at hullavington in wiltshire. we could use this space to build any old office. but instead, we're restoring the ex-airfield's former aircraft hangars, upgrading and rethinking their original structure so they work better for the people inside them. just like our machines. chopping energy usage. our headquarters in malmesbury are being modernised too. and we're taking the opportunity to reduce our environmental impact while we can. first up are our restaurants, where we've replaced gas hobs with induction units - negating the need for air conditioning, and powered by 100% renewable electricity. it's an approach we hope to apply to all future dyson sites. solving the skills gap. engineers are the world's problem-solvers. to tackle 21st century challenges like air pollution, we need more of them. the james dyson foundation is dyson's charity. its mission is to inspire a new generation of engineers. it provides money, materials and mentorship so that young people can get hands-on with problems – and learn how to solve them. find out more reducing harmful emissions. we’ve started installing electric car charging ports in our staff car parks, to encourage ownership of zero-emissions vehicles. we provide bus shuttles for the busiest commuter routes, and everyone at our headquarters, nestled in the english countryside, can also access a campus-wide lift-sharing scheme. fewer cars means fewer pollutants in the air we breathe – and fewer traffic jams. the engineer in everyone. not everyone at dyson is an engineer – but we encourage everyone to think like one. to take things apart and put them back together again, better. whatever your field of expertise – be it marketing, customer service or financial wizardry – we want you to challenge assumptions, and tackle the inefficiencies others ignore. careers at dyson waste not, want not. to ensure our machines keep performing, year after year, we submit them to rigorous testing. and when the tests are complete, we’re left with lots of perfectly good components that we'd rather not send to landfill. so some get re-used in further tests. some get recycled around the campus – like vacuum cyclone casings reimagined as stationery pots. and some are donated to a nearby charity for use in their projects, fostering creativity and a passion for engineering in our local community. resolute. relentless. we believe there is always a better way. so our engineers never stop working on new ideas, hidden in the depths of our research centers in wiltshire, malaysia and singapore. the brief? to solve the problems that others choose to ignore. and when they’re ready to share what they’ve created, you’ll hear all about it. next the future of engineering see the future of engineering home inside dyson community united states vacuum cleaners hair dryers support contact us opens in new window warranty terms opens in new window repairs and servicing information careers opens in new window press opens in new window california transparency declaration company information opens in new window james dyson foundation opens in new window privacy policy opens in new window accessibility statement terms & conditions opens in new window delivery details opens in new window safety recall opens in new window returns policy opens in new window corporate social responsibility opens in new window sitemap opens in new window © dyson 2018 select your location close location selector europe asia/pacific north america south america middle east africa belgie (nederlands) belgique (française) cyprus (english) danmark deutschland españa france hrvatska ireland italia latvija luxembourg (deutsch) luxembourg (français) magyarország nederland norge polska portugal românia schweiz (deutsch) slovenija slovenska republika suisse (française) suomi sverige svizzera (italiano) türkçe united kingdom österreich česká republika ελλάδα κύπρος (ελληνικά) българия россия (русский) україна australia hong kong (english) india indonesia (bahasa) indonesia (english) malaysia new zealand philippines (english) singapore south korea thailand (english) ประเทศไทย (ไทย) 中国大陆地区 (简体中文) 台灣（繁體中文) 日本 香港(繁體中文) canada (english) canada (français) costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras mexico usa brazil chile colombia panama peru israel (english) lebanon (english) qatar saudi arabia (english) türkçe uae (english) ישראל ( עברית) yisra'el الإمارات العربيّة المتّحدة ‎ السعودية جزيره العرب ‎ morocco south africa europe belgie (nederlands) belgique (française) cyprus (english) danmark deutschland españa france hrvatska ireland italia latvija luxembourg (deutsch) luxembourg (français) magyarország nederland norge polska portugal românia schweiz (deutsch) slovenija slovenska republika suisse (française) suomi sverige svizzera (italiano) türkçe united kingdom österreich česká republika ελλάδα κύπρος (ελληνικά) българия россия (русский) україна asia/pacific australia hong kong (english) india indonesia (bahasa) indonesia (english) malaysia new zealand philippines (english) singapore south korea thailand (english) ประเทศไทย (ไทย) 中国大陆地区 (简体中文) 台灣（繁體中文) 日本 香港(繁體中文) north america canada (english) canada (français) costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras mexico usa south america brazil chile colombia panama peru middle east israel (english) lebanon (english) qatar saudi arabia (english) türkçe uae (english) ישראל ( עברית) yisra'el الإمارات العربيّة المتّحدة ‎ السعودية جزيره العرب ‎ africa morocco south africa we'll notify you at we're sorry, but something went wrong. please try again.
