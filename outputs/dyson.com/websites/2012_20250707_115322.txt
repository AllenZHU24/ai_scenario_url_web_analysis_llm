saving on raw materials but not compromising on performance. dc24 the average motor in vacuum cleaners is 1700 watts. the dyson dc24 ball has only a 650 watt motor. so it uses less than half the electricity, yet is equal to the performance of a full-size upright. dyson airblade ™ unlike conventional dryers, the dyson airblade™ hand dryer does not use an energy intensive heating element, making it 80 per cent more energy efficient. dc30 dyson's latest handheld is powered by dyson's new energy efficient digital motor which means it picks up more dirt for less energy. news - april 2010 the dyson airblade™ hand dryer is the first hand dryer to be awarded the carbon reduction label from the carbon trust. to secure the carbon reduction label, the machine's total carbon footprint - the amount of carbon emissions (co2 and other greenhouse gases) produced from its materials and manufacture, transport, in-use and end of life - were measured and certified by the carbon trust. as part of the certification, dyson has committed to reducing the airblade™ hand dryer's carbon emissions further in the next two years. find out more about the carbon reduction label here www.dysonairblade.com more with less to download our environment policy click here our story so far 1975 frustrated with bagged cleaners that clog, james dyson starts to develop the dyson dual cyclone, the only vacuum cleaner not to lose suction. it has no bag to throw away. 1985 conscious of the carcinogenic and carbonaceous soot emitted by diesel exhausts, james dyson sets about developing a cyclonic filtration system to be fitted on cars and vans. he is turned down by the uk's department of trade and industry for development grants. 1997 five years after the first dyson vacuum goes on sale, james thinks about what would happen to the machines when they reach the end of their natural lives. his engineers come up with the recyclone - the first vacuum cleaner to be made from recycled plastic and recovered parts. 2001 dyson engineers and scientists start developing an energy efficient motor. 2004 the first dyson digital motor is engineered for dc12, a compact vacuum designed for japan. the switched reluctance motor is faster, smaller and lighter than a conventional a/c equivalent. 2007 the dyson airblade™ hand dryer is launched. powered by the dyson digital motor, a 400 mph sheet of air wipes hands clean rather than relying on an energy sapping heating element. it's 80 per cent more efficient than conventional warm air hand dryers and does away with the need for wasteful paper towels. 2008 the dyson dc24 vacuum proves that you don't need big motors for good pick up performance. this machine uses 650 watts of power-saving energy. sustainability becomes a key criteria in the james dyson award for student design. 2009 dyson's latest digital motor sees its first application in the dyson dc31 handheld cleaner. because of it, dc31 is smaller and over 20 per cent lighter than dc16. 1997 recyclone the machine made from recycled dyson machines. 2009 ddm v2 dyson's latest energy efficient digital motor. home environment shop vacuum cleaners fans & heaters hand dryers parts tools shopping info delivery details warranty details returns policy where to buy support get expert help register your warranty your account inside dyson the dyson story dyson technology james dyson charitable ventures games community press careers general contact us privacy terms and conditions environment sitemap dyson proves no loss of suction and pick up performance using results from iec60312 cl 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 2.9, astm f2607, f608 and f558, and dtm755 -
