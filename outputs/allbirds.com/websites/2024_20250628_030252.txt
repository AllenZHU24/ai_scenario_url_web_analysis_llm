not to worry. gifts can be returned within 30 days. just head to the top for the free returns process with your order number. it’s on the shipping label or the back of the gift note (if you got one). online and retail returns we take free returns in-store or online* (except for outlet purchases - see above). returning by mail just means flying up to the top and picking your country. otherwise, pick a store here and stop by to say hi! used shoes lightly used or like new shoes are donated to our partner, soles4souls, who then distributes them to people in need. still have questions?
