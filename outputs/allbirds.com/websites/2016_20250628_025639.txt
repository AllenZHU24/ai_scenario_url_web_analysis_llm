and its licensors shall not exceed ten dollars ($10). without limiting the foregoing, you understand and acknowledge that allbirds shall not be liable to you for: any indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary losses which may be incurred by you arising out of your use of, or inability to use, the site or the services, including any loss of profit (whether incurred

(including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the site and services; (ii) your violation of any of these terms, including the privacy policy; (iii) your violation of any third party rights, including without limitation any copyright, intellectual property, or privacy rights; or (vi) the use by any other persons accessing this site using your internet

defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you hereunder, and you shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense. you may not settle any claim contemplated in this section 8 without the prior written consent of allbirds. 9. links to other sites the site may contain links or references to other websites outside of our control. links to other websites may use our site logo or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. these websites may send cookies to you and may collect personally identifiable information about you and make use of that data in ways that this site would not. please be aware that allbirds has no control over these websites and that these terms of use do not apply to any third party sites. allbirds cannot be held responsible for those sites or external sources, or for any damage or losses deriving from the use of the content, or goods and services available on those sites or external sources. allbirds encourages you to read the privacy policies and terms of use linked or referenced in the websites you enter. 10. complaint procedures if you believe that any content or postings on this site violates your intellectual property or other rights, please notify allbirds by email at help@allbirds.com with a comprehensive detailed message setting forth the following information: (a) your name and the name of your company, if any; (b) your contact information, including your email address; (c) the nature and substance of your complaint, the specific rights at issue, and your basis for making the complaint, including the content or posting that is objectionable; and (d) the following statement: “the statements, representations, and assertions made in this message are true, complete, and accurate and i have the full legal authority to make each and every such statement, representation, and assertion and to make and be granted any demand made in this message.” 11. dispute resolution any dispute arising out of these terms shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the american arbitration association (the “aaa”). arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. however, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual; and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these terms, as a court would. all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. arbitration shall take place in san francisco, california, unless allbirds elects otherwise. the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the state of california. the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different allbirds users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same allbirds user to the extent required by applicable law. the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the aaa's rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, allbirds will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. any request for payment of fees by allbirds should be submitted by mail to the aaa along with your demand for arbitration and allbirds will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the aaa. if the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, allbirds will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse allbirds for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by allbirds on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the aaa's rules. if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply. you can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“opt-out notice”). the opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these terms for the first time. you must complete the opt-out notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the allbirds account to which the opt-out applies. you must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. this procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these terms will continue to apply. opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. 12. miscellaneous these terms, including the privacy policy, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and allbirds and govern your use of the site, services and any transactions you may have with allbirds through the site and completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements or understanding, arrangements, undertaking or proposal, written or oral, between you and allbirds in relation to such matters. in the event any other rule, code of conduct, or other matter posted on the site conflicts with the terms of these terms, these terms of use shall govern. no oral explanation or oral information given by any party shall alter the interpretation of these terms. notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand that allbirds may make changes to these terms from time to time. your continued use of the site following the posting of changes to these terms of use will be considered your consent to those changes. when these changes are made, allbirds will make a new copy of the terms of use available on the site. you agree that allbirds is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to the terms of use. you understand that it is your responsibility to check the terms regularly for changes. you agree that if allbirds does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these terms of use (or which allbirds has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of allbirds’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to allbirds. if any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide a matter arising out of these terms, rules that any provision of these terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from these terms without affecting the rest of the terms and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable. the site is controlled and operated from within the united states. without limiting anything else, allbirds makes no representation that the site, site content, comments, services, products, information or other materials available on, in, or through the site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where they are illegal is prohibited. those who choose to access the site from other locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws. last updated: 2/16/16 men women padded insole gift cards our story our promise help press careers contact 1-888-963-8944 help@allbirds.com flag
