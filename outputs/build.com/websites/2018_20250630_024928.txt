location. if you are not using a ppl that we provided, then please use a carrier that offers tracking (like ups) and remember to provide us with the carrier and tracking information. if your shipment

occur. back to top  2. when and why do i have to pay a restocking fee?most returns will not incur restocking fee charges. however, any order that receives customer-negotiated discounts may be subject

return it?’back to top  3. how do i cancel an order?cancellation requests must be processed by a customer service team member. please contact the appropriate customer service team for immediate
