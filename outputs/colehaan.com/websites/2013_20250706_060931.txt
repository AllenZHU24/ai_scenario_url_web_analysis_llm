"the inspiration for the video was a cross between keith haring's led signs and a movie from my youth, 'times square.' i knew jo and brian would make a strong creative team bringing great energy and balance. they created the city of my dreams - modern in every way and eye candy for miles." - jen brill behind the style at coachellawith photographer bridget fleming we partnered with photographer bridget fleming for a jaunt to coachella music festival in indio, california. known for her unique point of view, bridget started downtown from behind in 2010. she captures cultural influencers from behind as they ride their bikes below 14th street in new york city. for us, she switched to frontal portraits as she captured the style of coachella revelers plus a few of our favorite shoes and bags.

gentleman editor-in-chief jace lipstein was excited about working with us, but he went into overdrive once he saw the great jones wingtip and saddle. building on our history as a classic dress shoe maker, we focused on creating a lightweight shoe that fit into the wardrobe of the man ready to make bold, confident moves. with "light on your feet" as his theme, jace was drawn to the concept of boxing; a long-standing american pastime mixed with a great amount of confidence and power. when the models began boxing while wearing the great jones collection at trinity boxing gym in tribeca, we knew jace had made the right call. the great jones wingtip and saddle flexed with every movement and was so light that the guys sparred for hours. between jace's creative execution and the great jones style and technology, the results of the photo shoot are an absolute knock out. grungy gentleman is an online publication created by editor-in-chief jace lipstein. he's on a mission to provide the freshest perspective on style, entertainment, travel and anything else a man could want. fashion is meant to express your individuality and push boundaries. see how it's done at grungy gentleman. cole haan + tumblr #subwaystyle adventure cole haan and tumblr hosted a party to celebrate the redesign of the cole haan #subwaystyle blog and kick off fashion week. notable fashion bloggers like william yan, brandon stanton, bryant eslava and nicole alyse jumped on for an adventure through new york's subway system to the mta transit museum in brooklyn. vintage trains, subway ads and music from silent

urbanspace nyc: why i love this city. there’s nothing more exciting than a pop-up shop, let alone a pop-up-esque outdoor mall strip of booths in the middle of meatpacking. i walked around the other day in my martina wedge booties, paired with this adorable floral dress, and a leather jacket. i love how comfortable these shoes are, especially with all the running around i do everyday in this city. for a quick change, meeting my friends at a local bar, i threw on purple-ish jeans and my vintage fur coat—the mix of colors just works. shop the martina        shop all boots blue suede boots ah, the meatpacking district… the times we’ve had—from 11am on a quick shopping venture, to 3am after a night out. i’ve become recently acquainted with knee-high boots, and to me, these nola slouch boots are modern take on elvis presley’s blue suede shoes. you can find me strutting in these babies to the grill at the standard hotel or catch rooftop on a monday night (yes, on monday). shop the nola        shop all boots puddle-jumping johanna as a new york native, and now a new york city dweller, i’m pretty sure i’ve got the necessary street style to survive in this city, down pat. so, when cole haan approached me about a style partnership to show why their boots are the perfect choice for a city girl like me, there was no hesitation. hence, the first of three boots from day-to-night: the johanna wedge. i’m obsessed with these johanna wedge boots and i bet you didn’t realize they are waterproof too! or, maybe me fearlessly jumping in the puddles kind of gave that one away. there’s nothing more city-survival-savvy than a cute boot that can bear shoe-destroying weather. shop the johanna        shop all boots taking these boots into night—or just to a less casual fiesta—i paired them with high-waisted acid wash jeans, a crop top and cole haan’s shearling jacket. it’s penny lane meets… well, me. even though these boots seem super casual, when this jacket comes off, i could be standing in the middle of le bain dancing my bubble butt off. about us cole haan brand optical careers assistance my account order status shipping returns gift cards restoration services find a store
