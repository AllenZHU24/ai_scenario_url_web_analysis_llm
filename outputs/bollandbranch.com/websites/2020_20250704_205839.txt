who was profiting from it all? and how good, really, can a product be if it endangers the life of the people who make it? soon afterwards, we made a decision that took our lives in a wildly different direction. we decided to start a new textile company. one that did right by people. thousands of products, prototypes, and decisions later, it all boils down to that one choice: to do whatâ€™s right. it all starts organically from day one, we have engaged a supply chain weâ€™d gladly take home to our mothers. organic isnâ€™t a trendy marketing word for us. it is the non-negotiable foundation for our business. by choosing to use 100% organic cotton from our very first day, we have helped pave the way for a better life for tens of thousands of cotton farmers in india. the world of conventional cotton farming is filled with shortcuts and exploitation, and itâ€™s unforgivably dark stuff. in india, the average life expectancy of a cotton farmer is 35 years old, because of potent pesticides on the one hand, and supplier debt leading to preventable suicides on the other. we have committed to use 100% organic cotton because it makes a better life for the people who grow it, and because its makes a better product for the people who use it. it also saves 90% of the water used in conventional farming methods, and pays premiums to those who plant, ensuring that they remain debt-free. this helps us all sleep a bit better at night. because the purity and safety of our products is the promise we built our brand on, we also use third party verification to ensure that all of our raw material meets international standards for organic farming. last year, we bought2.4 million poundsof fair trade seed cotton, helping keep12,800 farmersout of debt. weâ€™ve also paid nearly $500,000 in additional wages to farmers and factory workers to sustain living wages. integrity in manufacturing: human rights are never a luxury itâ€™s no secret that conventional textile factories commit some pretty serious workplace abuses. the garment industry drives a demand for low overhead and quick turnaround, leading to dangerous and untenable working conditions. employees, some of whom are children, work long hours without proper rest, accommodations, or pay. but accepting the status quo is a choice, and we choose to reject it. boll & branch, was founded to do better by people. we manufacture in india, portugal, and the u.s., and our products are made by adults, who are paid fairly, treated with respect, and who work at will. we do not employ child labor, and frankly, we donâ€™t look too kindly on anyone who does. because of these standards we hold, we were proud to become the first fair trade certifiedâ„¢ manufacturer of linens. weâ€™re proud of that honor, but more importantly, weâ€™re proud that many of our factory employees have become like family to us. thatâ€™s equivalent to saving the greenhouse emissions from over 4,500 cars a year. our impact: because we boat our goods, we have saved 21,252 metric tons of carbon emissions. better for the planet: the planet is in precarious shape. and every choice we make today needs to be something we can defend to our children. were we helping? were we doing all we can? conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticide than any other crop in the world. pesticides and insecticides are distributed (with very little transparency) by major agribusiness firms and have a well-proven track record of harming the soil, air quality, the waterways, and the surrounding biological diversity where theyâ€™re used. additionally, when you bring conventionally grown cotton into your house, it can harbor traces of the chemicals used to treat it, causing irritation, rashes and dizziness. when cotton is grown organically, it substantially reduces the harm done to the environment around it. for pest control, we use marigolds instead of chemicals. organic cotton also uses 90% less water. to us, itâ€™s a no-brainer. a safer, more sustainable raw material that makes a softer, more luxurious product? sign us up for literally 2.8 million pounds of it. but, unfortunately, organic cotton only accounts for 1% of cotton grown throughout the world. once your bedroom and bathroom are outfitted in organic cotton from boll & branch, we hope youâ€™ll seek it out from other suppliers for your wardrobe, too. in 2018, our organic cotton saved 592,923,320 gallons of water. we are deeply committed to using sustainable raw materials throughout our business. this isnâ€™t a â€œmostlyâ€? or â€œwherever we canâ€? disclaimer that marketers put on their products to make people feel good. weâ€™re not into asterisks*. we commit to our choices, 100%.therefore, 100% of our product:- is made without harmful chemicals, pesticides or gmos- is made with sustainable raw materials- had responsible waste and water management treatment- was made in factories that prioritize workerâ€™s empowerment and sustainable incomes- 100% of our packaging is made from recycled paper and can be recycled and/or repurposed- 100% of our outer shippers are fsc certified*unless theyâ€™re fun beyond organic cotton: choose no evil. what gets us out of bed every morning?
