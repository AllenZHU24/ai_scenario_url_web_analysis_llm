the answer: we’re proud of the way we make bedding better, and we love to spotlight the details that make us different. as our founder and head of design, missy tannen, says, “when it comes to thread count, most people forget that the quality of threads is far more important than the quantity." terms of service privacy policy social media policy official promotion rules about about us reviews stories trade program press careers impact report store locations customer service contact us faq returns & exchanges shipping & return policy design consultations gift cards fabric swatches laundry care live chat do not sell or share my personal information limit the use of my sensitive personal information cookie settings close
