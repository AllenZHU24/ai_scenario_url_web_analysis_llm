think about it from the ground up. cotton is a soft, delicate fiber that grows in a ‘boll’—the protective case surrounding the cotton seed—and an extension of the supportive ‘branch.’ we have always committed to supporting and protecting organic cotton farmers in the developing world who have been marginalized and extorted by big name corporations for generations. metaphorically speaking, the boll does for the cotton seed as we strive to do for those who dedicate their lives to the farming and crafting of organic cotton. the cotton boll and branch are the foundation of our company, and everything we are able to do begins in the simplest form of the cotton plant. read our blog entry for more information! where are your products made? we searched the globe near and far in search of the best cotton, and ended up finding what we were looking for in orissa, india. our sateen and towel products are made with sustainable practices in india by people who earn respect and fair wages for their work, which means your business supports economic opportunity to a special group of cotton growers who have historically been underserved by big business. our flannel products are made sustainably in portugal by expert artisans who have mastered the tradition of flannel manufacturing and design, and the cotton used to create flannel originates from turkey. learn more about where our products are made by reading our blog entry! what are the benefits of organic cotton? we’re glad you asked! switching to organic cotton has a number of benefits for you, your family and your global neighbors. the environmental effects are astounding: farmers are able to grow cotton without the use of harmful chemicals and pesticides, preventing seepage and contamination into the groundwater that is so essential to the health and safety of local communities. this also means that you and your family can have a truly peaceful sleep, knowing that our products are pure, grown naturally and provide opportunity for so many people. three cheers for a feel-good sleep, inside and out! is your packaging eco-friendly? when you invest in our thoughtfully-made products, you receive the whole package! like our textile products, our packaging is eco-friendly and sustainably-produced. our white gift boxes are made without the use of laminations that prevent conventional boxes from being recycled. with a 100% recycled board, aqueous varnish and water-based adhesives, recycled contents make up more than 80% of each box. in addition to using recycled materials, we produce our boxes in a socially and environmentally focused factory, which is sa8000 certified, an accreditation for social accountability in the workplace. icon/+/medium/black created with sketch. icon/-/large/black created with sketch. our products what does thread count mean, and why does it matter? thread count is simply the industry’s standard measurement of the number of vertical and horizontal threads contained within one square inch of fabric. thread count isn’t necessarily an accurate indicator of fabric quality, nor it doesn’t ensure that you’re purchasing the safest or softest option. at boll & branch, we take thread count, softness, breathability, and sustainability into consideration to create the highest quality sheets for you and your family—you’re welcome! read our blog entry for more information. what thread count are boll & branch sheets? our signature sateen sheets are woven to a 300 thread count, delivering a breathability and softness that will instantly make them your go-to bedding. because we use ultra-premium single-ply organic cotton to create them, our sheets have an optimal balance of lightweight feel, softness, durability and quality. in short: they’re designed to be the softest, most comfortable sheets you will ever sleep in! you can read more on thread count by visiting our blog entry! what is a sateen weave? remember this: many factors affect the final result of the look and feel of a bed sheet. our sateen sheets are made with the characteristic four-over-one-under weave to achieve a super soft, silk and luxurious finish, while maintaining a balanced breathability. you can learn more about our sateen weave by reading our blog entry. do you offer fabric swatches? yes, we send swatches anywhere within the us. please contact our dream team at help@bollandbranch.com, and we'd be glad to send you one! how deep are your fitted sheets? all our fitted sheets have a 17-inch deep pocket. they also come with a full elastic banding that’s sewn around the edge for a little extra flexibility, ensuring a generous fit over even the deepest mattresses. see? every detail really does matter to us! do boll & branch sheets wrinkle? as with all of our products, we like to let nature run its course. this is why your 100% organic sheets may wrinkle more easily than conventional “wrinkle resistant” bed sheets that have been soaked with harsh chemicals or waxes. don’t worry, bedding perfectionists can still iron! check out our laundry care guide for more information! can i add a gift note to my order? of course! but remember, gift notes must be added at the time of purchase. to add a gift note, scroll over the shopping bag in the top right hand corner and click, “add a gift note.” after entering your note, please save your changes by clicking, “save note.” if you have any difficulty with this process, please contact customer experience at (800) 678-3234 before checkout.if you want to add a gift note after completing your order, please contact customer experience within 15 minutes of the purchase. because we pack and ship your orders as quickly as possible to ensure the fastest delivery to your home, we cannot guarantee that a gift note can be added after purchase. do you offer gift wrapping on orders? our bed sheets, duvet covers and throw blankets come in our celebrated white gift box, while the remainder of our products come in an equally beautiful presentation. please note that our flannel sheet sets and flannel duvet cover sets do not come in our signature white gift box. we do not offer additional gift wrapping services, because we’re sure your gift recipient will adore our signature packaging! do i need to wash my sheets before using? our sheets are shipped to you oversized to account for the slight, natural shrinkage that will occur after their necessary first wash. why is this important? because our production process is free of any harmful chemical sizing agents like formaldehyde or other laundering practices to pre-shrink the final product. we avoid those steps to remain true to our organic certified standards—and minimize the environmental impact of production by using less water, heat and other additives. if your sheets fit looser in the beginning, rest assured that after the first couple of washes your sheets will have the perfect fit. icon/+/medium/black created with sketch. icon/-/large/black created with sketch. orders can i use a discount code when purchasing a gift card?
