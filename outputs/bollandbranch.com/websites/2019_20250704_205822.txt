the type of support that sits under the boll & branch mattress is crucial to extending its lifespan and providing even support. the best option is to have it on the boll & branch foundation. however, if you prefer not to use the boll & branch foundation than some appropriate alternatives are a sturdy platform bed, a box spring in good condition, or a foundation in good condition.  proper support is required to comply with the terms and conditions of the mattress limited warranty. what is the boll & branch mattress made of? the boll & branch mattress is made of carefully-sourced materials to give you a healthy night’s sleep including: organic cotton, wool and poly blend, steel, two layers of natural talalay latex (one infused with natural graphite), compressed fibers, polyester and kevlar thread. for more detailed information on the layers, please click here. are your mattresses made with any foam? no, our mattress is 100% foam free. learn more about why we chose no foam here. how does the mattress feel? we know how important comfort is when considering a new mattress, especially when it comes to back support. our mattress is crafted to be cool, soft, and supportive for a better night’s sleep. how do your individually wrapped coils compare to memory foam mattresses? using individually wrapped coils ensured a more durable, longer-lasting mattress. plus, it sleeps much cooler than foam. foam is a closed cell material which absorbs heat and shrinks to mold to your body, making for a less comfortable sleep. the individually wrapped coils also supply long-term overall support and edge-to-edge support, which makes it easier to get out of bed! does the boll & branch mattress sleep hot? the boll & branch mattress was made with our customers’ needs in mind, and that included designing it for a cooler sleep. when creating our mattress we selected the most natural, breathable materials to help promote airflow. these materials include: two latex layers (one infused with natural graphite) which pull heat down for a natural cooling effect, a breathable wool/poly blend layer to replace heat-retaining foam, and two layers of coils which enable air to pass through. what is hand-tufting? hand-tufting is a time-honored method of securing each layer to make a mattress that is soft, supportive and prevents transfer movement. by hand-tufting, we avoid the use of glue which is common in the mattress industry, resulting in a stable, natural mattress and a healthier sleep. are there chemical fire retardants in the mattress? all mattresses sold in the us are mandated to meet strict flammability tests for increased consumer safety. we opted to use wool as our natural fire barrier, along with latex, to replace commonly-used chemicals. we believe in a safe and healthy sleep all the time, not just in an emergency. does the mattress transfer movement? the boll & branch mattress has limited motion-transfer making it perfect for couples and active sleepers. does this mattress support all types of sleepers? yes, our mattress is great for all different sleeping positions including back, side, and stomach. where in the united states are your mattresses made? all of our mattresses are handmade to order in texas and florida. icon/+/medium/black created with sketch. icon/-/large/black created with sketch. order details, shipping & handling what is a recycling fee?

either a box spring or a foundation can be used to support your mattress. a box spring is a wooden-framed box that has coils inside that help to distribute the weight of your mattress. with that said, a box spring tends to cause an uneven distribution of support amongst the mattress causing certain sections to wear quicker. a box spring also creates extra bounce which is not desirable when thinking about your new mattress.on the other hand, a foundation is used to support and raise your mattress. a foundation typically consists of a wooden frame and is more firm and supportive than a box spring. our foundation is made of a metal grid and six slats of wood that reinforce the entire surface causing a more even distribution of the mattress for better support and less bounce! do you carry different foundation depths? we currently carry a standard 9” foundation. what does the foundation weigh? twin: 28 lbs twin xl: 30 lbs full: 37 lbs queen: 49 lbs king (2 pieces): 30 lbs per piece cal king (2 pieces): 32 lbs per piece why do i need a foundation? if you do not already have a foundation you can purchase the boll & branch foundation which supplies a strong support for the mattress and added height if needed for your frame. however, the main purpose of any foundation is to absorb more of the weight put on the mattress and distribute it evenly, which is better for your back and overall sleep! *please note a proper foundation is necessary in regards to proper care and to stay within boll & branch’s limited warranty guidelines. what is the foundation made of? the boll & branch foundation is made of a metal grid and six slabs of wood. we use canadian pine which is not only more sustainable but also stronger because it grows in a colder climate with less moisture. this foundation is meant to give you the proper support your mattress needs for a great night’s sleep! how is my foundation shipped? your foundation is shipped the same way the boll & branch mattress is — with white glove delivery! our shipping carriers will follow the same process as they do with mattress. after the order arrives at a local facility, our shipping carriers will be in touch to schedule a delivery appointment. can the foundation be ordered and shipped separately? at this time, foundations can only be purchased if you are buying a mattress. we are unable to sell and ship foundations separately. can i return or exchange my foundation? at this time, we only accept foundation returns if you are returning the mattress as well. foundations cannot be returned individually. icon/+/medium/black created with sketch. icon/-/large/black created with sketch. caring for your mattress how do i clean my mattress if staining occurs or if i feel it needs to be washed?
