vacuum cleaners are one of the most important appliances in your home today. they help keep your floors and air free from dust and allergies. we are proud to offer expert advice and assistance to help you find a top rated vacuum cleaner within any budget. evacuumstore carries models from all the top major manufactures including: electrolux, miele, sebo, dyson, hoover, kenmore and more! whether you have wall-to-wall carpeting, hardwood floors or berber rugs, we can help you to locate a unique machine based directly on your needs. the first step in choosing the right machine, is to pin-point the types of flooring you'll be cleaning. if you have carpets, you'll require an electric power nozzle while hard floors may only need an air driven turbo nozzle. uprights are usually only recommended for heavy carpeting and canisters are ideal for hardwood floors or tile. need help? call our dedicated vacuum experts today at 866-972-8227 there are thousands of brands and different models to choose from in many different price ranges. because every cleaning surface requires a different type of cleaning, selecting the perfect machine for your home or business can be a tiresome and tedious task. at one time, salespersons would travel from door to door showcasing the newest models available and demonstrating the different features each had to offer. most vacuum cleaners today utilize hepa filtration. this filtration method is used to treat the symptoms of allergies, sinusitis and asthma by removing dangerous particles from the air. if you suffer from any of these ailments or from a multiple chemical sensitivity, it is important to find a cleaner with high filtration efficiency in order to alleviate your symptoms. if you do suffer from allergies or asthma, a bagged system will most likely be necessary. while bagless vacuum cleaners are very convenient, dust and dirt can easily escape when emptying the dust cup and enter into the air. using a bagged system in conjunction with a hepa air purifier can help to make a tremendously positive impact in reducing allergy or asthma symptoms. while uprights and canisters are the standard for residential use, we also offer many different types of commercial vacuum cleaners. there are many different brands to choose from each with its pros and cons. for heavy-duty industrial use, a commercial upright with or without a bag is usually recommended. we also offer backpacks for indoor and outdoor use by a wide range of different brands using both hepa and ulpa filtration. backpacks can be purchased with either an electric power nozzle kit or an air driven brush. in addition to our selection of commercial models, we also offer wet/dry machines for both residential and industrial use. no matter which kind of surfaces you'll be cleaning, if you have pets in the home, suffer from allergies or asthma or own a business, we are sure to have a vacuum cleaner suitable for your needs. which brand is the best vacuum cleaner? both miele and sebo vacuum cleaner brands offer many varieties of models along with unmatched durability. there are many versions of vacuum cleaners on the market today. to find the best vacuum cleaner you will need to find one that will fit your needs the best. some people will want cordless and some will want a longer lasting corded version. evacuumstore recommends miele and sebo
