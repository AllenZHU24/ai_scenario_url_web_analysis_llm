equipment fireplace vacuums marine vacuums car wash vacuums shop, compare and review vacuum cleaners online there are thousands of brands and different models of vacuum cleaners to choose from in many different price ranges. because every cleaning surface requires a different type of cleaning, selecting the perfect vacuum cleaner for your home or business can be a tiresome and tedious task. at one time, salespersons would travel from door to door showcasing the newest models available and demonstrating the different features each had to offer. however, the market has become inflated with thousands of different brands offering so many options that it can be difficult to locate a vacuum cleaner that actually meets its claims. we are proud to offer expert advice and assistance to help you find a great vacuum cleaner within any budget. whether you have wall-to-wall carpeting, hardwood floors or expensive berber rugs, we can help you to locate a unique machine based directly on your needs. the first step in choosing a vacuum, is to pin-point the types of flooring you'll be cleaning. if you have carpets, you'll require an electric power nozzle while hard floors may only need an air driven turbo nozzle. upright vacuums are usually only recommended for heavy carpeting as they can easily scratch smooth floors. for hardwood floors or tile, use a canister vacuum without an agitator brush. most vacuum cleaners today utilize hepa filtration. this filtration method is used to treat the symptoms of allergies, sinusitis and asthma by removing dangerous particles from the air. if you suffer from any of these ailments or from a multiple chemical sensitivity, it is important to find a cleaner with high filtration efficiency in order to alleviate your symptoms. if you do suffer from allergies or asthma, a bagged system will most likely be necessary. while bagless vacuum cleaners are very convenient, dust and dirt can easily escape when emptying the dust cup and enter into the air. using a bagged system in conjunction with a hepa air purifier can help to make a tremendously positive impact in reducing allergy or asthma symptoms. while uprights and canisters are the standard for residential use, we also offer many different types of commercial vacuum cleaners. there are many different brands to choose from each with it's pros and cons. for heavy-duty industrial use, a commercial upright with or without a bag is usually recommended. we also offer backpack vacuums for indoor and outdoor use by a wide range of different brands using both hepa and ulpa filtration. backpacks can be purchased with either an electric power nozzle kit or an air driven brush. in addition to our selection of commercial models, we also offer wet/dry vacuums for both residential and industrial use. no matter which kind of surfaces you'll be cleaning, if you have pets in the home, suffer from allergies or asthma or own a business, we are sure to have a vacuum cleaner suitable for your needs. about trust online accept credit cards online shipping and returns | privacy notice | contact us all contents © copyright 2012 evacuumstore.com. all rights reserved.
