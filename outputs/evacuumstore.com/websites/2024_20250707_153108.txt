easily at home. on most vacuum cleaners you will need to unscrew the base of the vacuum cleaner in order to gain access to the brushroll. these screws can be located on either the top or bottom of the base of the sweeper or power head. once the base has been unscrewed and removed, locate the agitator brush of your vacuum cleaner. remove the brush and replace the belt on the motor shaft and around the brushroll using the brush to stretch the belt into place. make sure to lock the brushroll back into place. replace the base of your carpet sweeper. how to change a brush assembly: changing the brushroll on your sweeper is another common repair. the agitator brush of your sweeper is powered by a belt and brushes the carpet, loosening dirt and allowing it to be picked up by the suction of your machine. while the brushroll in your machine may never break, replacing it is very simple in the event that it does. unscrew and remove the base of your vacuum. remove the brushroll making sure to remove the end caps as well. at this time, you may want to consider replacing the belt on your machine as well. place the belt around your brush and stretch the belt into place making sure to lock the end caps of your brush into place. replace the base of your machine and tighten each screw. read lessread more advance vacuum parts atrix vacuum parts beam vacuum parts bissell vacuum parts bosch
