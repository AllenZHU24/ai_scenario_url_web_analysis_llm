"we're standing there, going, 'how in the world in this day and age can we still be spending $36 for eight razor blades, and why has no one disrupted this on the internet?'" masiello recalled. that was late 2011. several months later, a startup called dollar shave club went viral with an irreverent online ad featuring its improv-comedy-trained ceo. "do you think your razor needs a vibrating handle, a flashlight, a back-scratcher and 10 blades?" dollar shave's michael dubin asked in the video. "your handsome-ass grandfather had one blade. and polio." now the online razor field includes entrants such as shavemob, manpacks, club shavemate and harry's, all trying to capitalize on discontent with brand-name razor prices. ("save 70 percent," shavemob declares on its site.) 800razors, which launched its site in july after beta-testing for several months, hopes to differentiate itself as the quality alternative. its prices are basically middle of the pack among gillette's new competitors, not the absolute lowest. but masiello argued that his company's american-made, ceramic-coated blades are on a par with gillette products and better than what his fellow would-be disrupters are selling. 800razors has a money-back guarantee that masiello said only two customers have taken him up on. and the company doesn't require a monthly subscription, as some competitors do. but while 800razors takes a few shots at its fellow startups -- "the internet razor guys with the funny video burn people by importing crappy razors from asia and screwing americans out of jobs," it declares on its website -- it's largely aiming at gillette. and no wonder. the company had 62 percent of the u.s. razor market last year, according to market-research firm euromonitor international. some estimates are substantially higher. even a small portion of that customer base could put a new firm in a very comfortable position. 800razors has two products for men and one for women. its five-blade men's razor, aimed at gillette fusion customers, costs $17.99 for eight cartridges -- the handle, and shipping, is free. fusion prices vary, but it's typically about $30 for eight if not on sale. and that doesn't account for the $11 or so you'd have to shell out first for the "system," the handle and original cartridge. amazon sells the fusion at below list price. but the online retailing giant still charges more than $30 for the eight cartridges and the original razor. steve schneid, an optometrist from potomac, was among 800razors' early customers -- he saw a beta-tester deal of four cartridges for a penny in march and figured he'd give it a try. now he's a convert. he figures he saves about $25 every time he buys a 14-pack. schneid has one of the vibrating-handle fusions and went so far as to shave half his face with that razor and the other with 800razors' product to get a close comparison. "you can't tell the difference," he said. "why pay more?" gillette declined to comment. but tim barrett, who follows the men's grooming industry for euromonitor, said the company should definitely be worried by its lower-priced competition. u.s. razor volumes have fallen for the better part of a decade as customers cut back, he said. the rising popularity of facial hair is partly to blame. but barrett said a negative feedback loop is the main driver. gille this entry was posted in press on november 18, 2013 by razor_admin. ← previous post next post → refer a friend don't let your friends gets burned! if you're an existing customer, enter your friends email addresses below and they will receive $5 off their first order. your name: your friend's email address: submit recent blog post will baseball celeb brian wilson finally shave his beard? live burn free with 800razors.com! 800razors.com sponsor spotlight review information contact@800razors.com newsletter sign-up go connect with us: copyright 2013 800razors, llc. all rights reserved. the burn-free guarantee is a trademark of 800razors, llc. all other trademarks acknowledged. terms and conditions | press@800razors.comdesign by 906creative | powered by drawpixel
