($4.99 walgreens.com). check out the dove men+care site for tips on how to achieve the perfect shave. the men’s groomer small round brush: made just for men’s hair and sold exclusively on themensgroomer.com ($38.00). schneidman recommends blow drying the front of hair using the brush for volume and almost a pompadour of sorts while leaving the back messy and more natural. organic male resurface: when all eyes are on your face, you want to make sure that you’ve taken on flaky bits and oily bits. this citrus bamboo resurfacing scrub allows you to also tackle ingrown hairs, which might happen during the first few days or weeks of movember. definitely on the higher end of men’s grooming products ($40.00 om4men.com) but organic male products are fair trade, eco-friendly and fda-approved organic. 800razors.com sells razors that compare to the top in the market, at steeply discounted prices. gillette fusion proglide styler 3-in-1 men’s body groomer with beard trimmer: well, that’s a mouthful, but this tool can help keep your ‘stache from looking ragged and also keeps brows and sideburns well groomed. (under $20.00 on amazon.com) organix texturizing paste: schneidman mentioned one of his favorite grooming products for men is shu uemura shape paste, which runs about $38.00. if you’re looking for something a bit more affordable, organix now has a line for men including the citrus mint texturizing paste which you can use in your hair, but also to smooth down unruly mustache hair as it grows. (less than $7.00 at drugstores nationwide). art of shaving sandalwood shave kit: if you’ve ever longed for an old-fashioned hot shave in the comfort of your home, you’re in luck. the art of shaving is active in the movember movement (the first 100 people to raise $100 can win a cool money clip—with a ‘stache, natch). their mid-size sandalwood shave kit includes a badger brush, pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and aftershave balm, all for under $60.00. listerine whitening restoring fluoride rinse: if more people will be studying your ‘stache, they’re going to be closer than ever. swish for 60 seconds after brushing to whiten teeth and freshen breath.
