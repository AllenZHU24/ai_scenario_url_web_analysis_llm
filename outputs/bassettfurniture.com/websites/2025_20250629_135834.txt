can dress your bedroom as you would yourself – in your style, for your comfort, as it gives you pleasure. handcrafted by bassett artisans, our furniture is constructed to your specifications with painstaking attention to detail and quality. from wood beds to upholstered, from dressers to chests to nightstands and night tables, your bedroom furniture selections can be customized with finish and hardware choices, fabric and leather options, and more. it’s time to build your sleep sanctuary, piece by custom piece, and rest in the easy luxury you deserve. does my bedroom furniture need to match? when it comes to bedroom furniture, matching the pieces isn't a hard and fast rule at all. but harmonizing your pieces under an aesthetic umbrella is important to the overall feel of your space. the key to creating this cohesive look is to have it reflect both your personal style and your design plan, while also fostering the sense of tranquility crucial to a serene sleep sanctuary. sometimes a perfectly matched bedroom set can provide a lowkey yet polished and coordinated appearance. in other circumstances, mixing different designs, textures, and finishes can add depth and personality to a room that is a truly personal enclave. an upholstered bed in a fabric or leather you love can soften a sleek, modern aesthetic or add a touch of glamour to a more zen setting. or think how a distinctively upholstered accent chair or boldly colored chest can offer a counterpoint to natural wood tones, enlivening both. the most important thing is to choose elements that resonate with you and contribute to a peaceful bedroom setting. whether you prefer a classic, symmetrical look or an eclectic, collected design, basset’s diverse bedroom collections allow you to curate a bedroom that feels uniquely yours. you can explore combinations that speak to your style and comfort with our room planner tool and materials workroom. design the bedroom of and for your sweetest dreams. do you have tips for maximizing storage space in a small bedroom? maximizing storage space in a small bedroom is all about finding creative solutions – choosing the right type of furniture can make a clean sweep of tumbled chaos. start by choosing multifunctional pieces that do double duty. storage beds are ideal for small bedrooms, offering underbed drawers for bed linens or seasonal wardrobe items without taking up any extra square footage. even the visual clarity offered by low-profile platform beds helps to maintain an uncluttered, spacious feel. consider using a storage ottoman at the foot of the bed to closet blankets and pillows while also adding seating. another approach includes choosing furniture pieces that use vertical space, providing essential storage in a smaller footprint. for instance, choose a tall chest instead of a wide dresser for clothing. a modestly scaled chest can also be placed in lieu of a nightstand on one side of the bed, maximizing that space for storage as well. consider a nightstand with some drawers over a night table with only shelving, adding even more storage “behind closed doors.” and shelving units or tall storage cabinets are not just for living room use – they’re another example of going vertical to go “big” on storage. depending on the style of the unit you choose to add to your bedroom, it can offer storage for everything from media to books to clothing. with clever consideration, an open mind, and an ever-expanding variety of finely crafted bassett furnishings, you can design a bedroom as functional as it is welcoming, no matter the size. how do i layer and style my bed like a designer? through thoughtful layering of high-quality bedding essentials, your bed can look and feel as if it came straight out of your favorite design magazine. like any good outfit (for body or bed), set the foundation for your look. start by choosing silky-soft cotton sateen or luxuriously weighty linen sheets in white, neutral, or a color that is grounded in your room’s aesthetic. if your taste embraces decorative detailing, sheet sets with embroidered trim add a subtle yet elegant designer flair. depending upon your sleep preferences or the season, your next layer can either be a coverlet (or quilt) or a duvet. a quilt or coverlet adds texture and personality, whether topping your sheets or draped gracefully across the end of your bed. keep your look classic with a timeless stripe or ikat pattern that can easily complement both relaxed and polished ensembles. or go cleanly modern with a monochromatic statement. the downiness of a duvet is enhanced when left in fluffed mode – feather light atop your sheets or folded into a comforting cloud beneath your coverlet. encase your duvet cover in fine fabric akin to (or even matching) the fabric you chose for your sheets. don’t be afraid to go oversized! along with attention to detail, lavish proportions are one more sumptuous sensibility that takes your bed from made to majestic. once you've dressed your bed in the essentials, it's time to add the finishing touches. start with a few standard pillows along the headboard, then build a rich tapestry of decorative pillows in front. the number of pillows that’s right for you is both a personal preference as well as a nod to your décor aesthetic. however many you choose, you’ll want to mix and match textures like velvet, linen, and cotton, as well as play with patterns and embroidered designs. complete the look with a cozy throw blanket at the foot of your bed – your warm toes will thank you. read dress your perfect bed for more details and inspiration. find more ideas and inspiration from the bassett blog. how can rustic be modern? dress your perfect bed sweet bassett dreams in
