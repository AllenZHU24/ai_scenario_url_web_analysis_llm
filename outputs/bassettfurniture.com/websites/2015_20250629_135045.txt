usually takes us just 30 days for your order to be ready for delivery. for custom items, time to completion depends on your fabric and parts being in stock. your local store team will advise you of any stock delay. we also strive to schedule delivery around your needs - this may extend the total time to delivery. accessories because we use many different vendors in order to bring you such a great variety and range of accessories, delivery times range from 2 – 4 weeks. once your accessory order is placed, your design consultant will advise you of expected time and may be able to issue a tracking number once your pieces have shipped. national home delivery customers once your order is ready, we’re proud to have partnerships with premiere furniture home delivery services nationwide to

their local stores and delivery centers. we are proud to have a strong network of bassett stores and retail partners across the country. whenever possible, we pass on the delivery and care of your web order to these local stores and retail partners. order acknowledgement once you place an order online, you’ll receive an email acknowledging both your order and your sale price. this email will also include the contact information for the local team handling your order. review, confirmation and updates the location handling your order will review your order to verify your items, especially when

several days of the week on which we regularly deliver. one to two days before scheduled delivery, your local team will provide a 3 hour window for when you can expect your furniture. due to complicated delivery schedules, bassett is not able to guarantee a specific delivery time. at your request, however, your local store will gladly contact you 1 hour prior to scheduled delivery.
