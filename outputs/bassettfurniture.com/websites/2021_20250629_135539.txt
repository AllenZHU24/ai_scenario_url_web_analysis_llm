generally, the fabric will be the determining factor in how long a fabric sofa lasts. in other words, you're more likely to see rips and tears in fabric than have actual structural issues with the frame of a sofa. but thanks to new performance fabrics and other modern materials, a fabric sofa can last upwards of 15 years when cared for correctly. which color sofa should i buy? the color of your sofa can vary widely based on taste and the style of your space. for some, having a sofa that matches everything else is the goal. however, often the best combinations of colors are across from one another on the color spectrum. if you need help finding the perfect sofa color for your space, our interior design consultants are standing by to help you create the perfect look. how long should a good leather sofa last? it depends on the quality of the leather sofa you buy, both in the leather and frame construction. a well-built piece of leather furniture can last upwards of 25 years if cared for properly. with that said, your leather furniture pieces could easily become multigenerational heirlooms to pass down in your family. is a leather sofa better than a fabric sofa? whether or not a leather sofa is better than fabric is all up to personal preference. for some spaces, the leather may clash with the other styles in the room. so in this situation, a fabric sofa may be better because of the variety of colors and patterns available. however, we have multiple leather color options as well, and if leather is your style and fits your space, who are we to tell you which is better? are leather sofas worth it? it depends on who you ask, as there is no accounting for personal taste. however, to those who love leather sofas, there's no comparison. leather sofa connoisseurs love their modern appeal, an upholstery surface that's cool to the touch, and long-lasting durability. if this sounds like you, then we think a leather sofa would undoubtedly be worth it! back to top about us vision & values your story store reviews careers investors our community impact environmental initiatives military & first responders discount resources upholstery warranty wood warranty catalog product registration product safety bassett community customer service shipping & delivery return policy preference center bassett credit card online terms privacy accessibility faqs contact us safety in store and in home store locator store locator view all stores to the trade dealer site club level by bassett to the trade dealer site club level by bassett be the first to know about new arrivals & special offers footer newsletter invitation footer sign up for newsletter submit facebook pinterest houzz youtube instagram twitter linkedin * click here for sale details. if you don't have adobe® reader® get it here: get adobe® reader® copyright © 2003-2021 bassett furniture industries. all rights reserved. website development by beacon technologies private saleunlock your access save 30%* on one item slide up newsletter invitation pop-up newsletter sign up sign up you're in! use code treat in-store and online. *off original prices new stores in your neighborhood greensboro, nc, 4501 landover drive - now open interested in working with us?
