teak lasts a really, really long time. not only is it durable, but teak is also pest resistant, low maintenance, and happens to look great. most importantly, teak is weather-resistant, containing natural oil that repels moisture. that means your teak outdoor sofa is highly resistant to warping, cracking, or turning brittle. metal / aluminium outdoor sectional another popular frame material is aluminum. the metal is light-weight, yet very strong. aluminum is rust-resistant, requiring little maintenance, and weather-resistant, able to survive wet, cold weather unscathed. wicker outdoor sectional our wicker outdoor sectionals and sofas are made with a performance wicker resin that is able to stand up to moisture much better than natural (rattan) wicker. the synthetic wicker looks and feels natural, but offers weather-resistant durability unmatched by rattan. seating capacity once you have your frame materials selected, you'll need to decide on the size of your outdoor sofa. small outdoor sofas a small, 2-seat sofa may be preferable if your patio has a smaller footprint, or if your sitting area is limited by an outdoor dining area. not to worry. you can make the most of your space and add a bit more surface area with a matching outdoor ottoman or side tables. the added benefit: smaller sofas are easier to maneuver into the perfect position. large outdoor sofas if you have the wiggle room, a larger outdoor sofa offers space for more family and friends to join in. consider pairing your 3-seat outdoor sofa with an outdoor coffee table instead of side tables. a coffee table is better able to provide the coverage you need for a larger seating area. outdoor sectional sofas if you want to create the ultimate outdoor paradise, the patio sectional sofa is the way to go. choose from 5-seat or 6-seat options. no matter what you choose, you'll have plenty of room to spread out comfortably. customize your outdoor sectional or sofa there are a number of ways to customize your dream outdoor sectional or outdoor sofa. and, we're here to help you through every step of the process. get the process started by scheduling a consultative appointment with one of our knowledgeable design associates. our outdoor sectional & sofa collections we carry a range of outdoor sectional and sofa collections sure to match any style. from bassett’s edgemont collection with outdoor sectionals and sofas featuring clean lines, crisply tailored upholstery, and a solid indonesian teak wood construction. to something more durable like the florence collection offering durable, weather-resistant selections with reinforced aluminum frames to stop breaking or rusting. • edgemont • florence • huntington • lakeview top questions to ask yourself before buying an outdoor sectional 1. how big is your space? check the size of your space vs. the size of the outdoor sectional or sofa that you're after. make sure to take things into account like legroom, and foot traffic so you leave enough room in your space for it to be functional. 2. how do you plan on using your outdoor furniture? for casual sitting around or extended use like outdoor dining? 3. how many people do you plan on entertaining? you have to make sure you have enough seating if you're having a backyard get together or party. 4. how often do you plan on using the furniture? will you be entertaining casually or using your outdoor sectional every day? 5. what style are you going for? you have to consider not only your other outdoor or patio furniture, but also your house exterior and landscaping. back to top about us vision & values your story store reviews careers investors our community impact environmental initiatives military & first responders discount resources upholstery warranty wood warranty catalog product registration product safety bassett community customer service shipping & delivery return policy preference center bassett credit card online terms privacy accessibility faqs contact us store locator store locator view all stores to the trade dealer site club level by bassett to the trade dealer site club level by bassett be the first to know about new arrivals & special offers footer newsletter invitation footer sign up for newsletter submit facebook pinterest houzz youtube instagram twitter linkedin * click here for sale details. if you don't have adobe® reader® get it here: get adobe® reader® copyright © 2003-2023 bassett furniture industries. all rights reserved. website development by beacon technologies get insider info on newarrivals, big events &special offers. slide up newsletter invitation pop-up newsletter sign up submit thank you for signing up! privacy policy new stores in your neighborhood greensboro, nc, 4501 landover drive - now open interested in working with us?
