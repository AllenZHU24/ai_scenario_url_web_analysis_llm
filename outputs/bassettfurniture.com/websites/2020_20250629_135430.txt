by 1917, company sales reached $1 million. but family members had started new companies that ultimately competed with each other for sales. in 1930, a “house divided” meeting was called and the different companies were incorporated into bassett furniture industries, inc., in 1931. the post-war years brought rapid growth as large neighborhoods sprang up quickly around the country. in the early 1960s, the company bought prestige furniture corp. and added upholstery to its line up and acquired three other companies to expand its bedroom and dining room production. furniture markets began to shift in the 1990s and many “mom-and-pop” stores were closed as large store chains with “no-name” furniture were gaining a foothold. seeing this trend, bassett opened its first store in 1997. the design was a departure from the compartmentalized rooms of typical furniture stores with little lifestyle merchandising. since then, the retail store has undergone two updates to keep up with retail trends. the company is pushing to incorporate more technology into its stores, so the store is a continuation of the web experience customers started at home. but with the convenience of technology, we remain committed to providing the best customer service experience in furniture retailing because there is no substitute for a friendly, knowledgeable design consultant to make sure you get exactly the furniture you want. today, bassett remains committed to the early principles of the company … that great quality, stylish furniture does not need to be expensive and should be available to everyone. a visit to one of our stores and you’ll see just how committed we are to that idea. view our catalog back to top about us vision & values store reviews careers investors our community impact environmental initiatives military & first responders discount resources upholstery warranty wood warranty catalog product registration product safety bassett community customer service shipping & delivery return policy preference center bassett credit card online terms privacy accessibility faqs contact us safety in store and in home store locator store locator to the trade dealer site club level by bassett to the trade dealer site club level by bassett be the first to know about new arrivals & special offers footer newsletter invitation footer sign up for newsletter submit facebook pinterest houzz youtube instagram twitter linkedin * click here for sale details. if you don't have adobe® reader® get it here: get adobe® reader® copyright © 2003-2021 bassett furniture industries. all rights reserved. website development by beacon technologies get insider info on new arrivals, big events & special offers. slide up newsletter invitation sign up submit new stores in your neighborhood greensboro, nc, 4501 landover drive - now open interested in working with us? search openings enter for your chance to win a $10,000 bassett shopping spree enter now
