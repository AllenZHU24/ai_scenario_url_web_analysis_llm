(these extra chairs can do double duty as well. if chosen wisely, the chairs designed to augment seating around the table when it’s expanded can also be used to offer extra seating in your living room.) whichever style appeals to you, it's essential that the table you choose fits comfortably in your space. take measurements of your room, being mindful that you’ll generally want 2 ½ to 3 feet of walking space around the table once the chairs (and guests) slide into place. read our complete guide to table sizes for more helpful details and designer tips. does my dining room furniture need to match? no, your dining room furniture doesn’t need to match! in fact, mixing, matching and coordinating the style and material of furnishings adds personality and character to your aesthetic. the key is to curate a blend of different styles, materials, colors, and wood tones that reflect your tastes as well as your home’s overall aesthetic. for instance, you can pair our modern origins nichols round dining table in a black carbon finish with our asher dining chair upholstered in brown faux leather to create a sleek, streamlined look. or, mix a classic wood table, side chairs in wood and fabric, and two upholstered chairs for a softer, more eclectic feel. another approach is to use a dining bench in lieu of a few dining chairs on one side of the table for a casual, slide-on-in vibe. ultimately, the goal is to create a space that reflects your personal style while meeting your needs. start with pieces you love and be sure to ask for help if you start to feel overwhelmed – bassett designers love their role as free personal stylists! how can i successfully coordinate different wood tones in my dining room? like mixing furniture styles, coordinating different wood tones in your dining room can create a warmer, more inviting space when done thoughtfully. start by choosing a primary wood stain or finish for a major piece, like the table, then choose complementary tones for other pieces. for example, pair a dark maple dining table with side chairs framed in a lighter wood which could match a sideboard. include a couple of custom upholstered dining seats to add softness and interest without overwhelming the space . you can visually lighten the room by introducing metal or glass accents, while metal lamps, glass vases, and mirrors can provide a refreshing visual break. simplify your mix-it-up challenge by sticking to two or three wood finishes, and repeat one or two of them at least once for your dining room to feel balanced. find more ideas and inspiration from the bassett blog. the complete guide to table sizes dining room decorating ideas that will wow you how to prepare for a party and entertain your guests how to choose the right rug size get expert design help on your project...big or small design services our designers would love to help you craft a space you love and want to share. materials workroom see our fabrics, leathers and wood finishes. select your favorites for your next design. comfort story comfort is personal. we use generations of skill to build a style that fits you. blog visit our blog for insight into making the most of living in your space. be the first to know. new arrivals & special offers sent straight to your inbox. email email signup successful please provide a valid email about us our story careers investors community involvement environmental initiatives military & first responders discount resources upholstery warranty wood warranty catalog product safety bassett community blog product knowledge new age recall information customer service shipping & delivery return & cancellation policy direct mail preferences bassett credit card affirm financing gift card faqs contact us store store locator store reviews member tools to the trade sales tools club level by bassett copyright © 2003-2025 bassett furniture industries. all rights reserved. online terms privacy accessiblity statement */ // -->
