the average size of a sofa is from 5' to 6' wide and 32" to 40" in height. a good rule of thumb is to allow one foot of space around your sofa to accommodate traffic and legroom. if you're looking for a sofa that will grant you a little more sitting space than average, you can opt for something longer from 87 " to 100" or go extra-long one with a length of over 100". a standard sofa measures 25" deep, although most sofas have a depth ranging from 22" to 26". sofa widths even though most sofas have a width between 70" and 96", a standard three-seater sofa measures between 70" and 87" in length. the average and most common sofa length is 84". 55-60" 60-65" 65-70" 70-75" 75-80" 80-85" 85-90" 90-95" 95-100" 115-120" sofa heights sofa height is the distance from the ground to the back top of a sofa; this can range from 26" to 36" in height. the high-back sofas are structured with a traditional back angle, while low-back sofas feature a modern style, usually at a different angle. 30-35" 35-40" 40-45" sofa seat depths sofa seat depth is the distance between the seat's front edge to the seat's backside. a standard depth is around 25" on average, although most sofas range from 22" to 26". for average-height individuals, the standard depth of 20" to 25" works great, whereas taller individuals may find best results with a little more depth. deep-seat sofas have a seat depth of 28" and 35," while extra-deep ones have seat depths over 35". read more in our blog about the depth of your sofa. 21-23" 23-25" 25-27" make your own custom sofa at bassett furniture, we want you to love your new sofa, not just like it. but, if you just can't settle on one of our existing leather or fabric sofa models, you can also customize one to your heart's content – or even create one from scratch. we believe that empowering you to tailor or custom design your sofa will help you reach that ultimate level of enjoyment. take as much or as little control as you'd like in designing your perfect sofa. our in-house design consultants will help you through every phase of the process. visit a bassett furniture store there are so many excellent sofa options to consider, and the bassett furniture website is a great place to begin your search. to appreciate the unbelievable comforts and the fine craftsmanship of our sofas, however, we recommend you experience our store in person by visiting a bassett furniture store near you. f.a.q.s related to sofas how long do fabric sofas last? generally, the fabric will be the determining factor in how long a fabric sofa lasts. in other words, you're more likely to see rips and tears in fabric than have actual structural issues with the frame of a sofa. but thanks to new performance fabrics and other modern materials, a fabric sofa can last upwards of 15 years when cared for correctly. which color sofa should i buy? the color of your sofa can vary widely based on taste and the style of your space. for some, having a sofa that matches everything else is the goal. however, often the best combinations of colors are across from one another on the color spectrum. if you need help finding the perfect sofa color for your space, our interior design consultants are standing by to help you create the perfect look. how long should a good leather sofa last? it depends on the quality of the leather sofa you buy, both in the leather and frame construction. a well-built piece of leather furniture can last upwards of 25 years if cared for properly. with that said, your leather furniture pieces could easily become multigenerational heirlooms to pass down in your family. is a leather sofa better than a fabric sofa? whether or not a leather sofa is better than fabric is all up to personal preference. for some spaces, the leather may clash with the other styles in the room. so in this situation, a fabric sofa may be better because of the variety of colors and patterns available. however, we have multiple leather color options as well, and if leather is your style and fits your space, who are we to tell you which is better? but you can visit our blog to read more about what our designers consider the most durable sofa. are leather sofas worth it? it depends on who you ask, as there is no accounting for personal taste. however, to those who love leather sofas, there's no comparison. leather sofa connoisseurs love their modern appeal, an upholstery surface that's cool to the touch, and long-lasting durability. if this sounds like you, then we think a leather sofa would undoubtedly be worth it! back to top about us vision & values your story store reviews careers investors our community impact environmental initiatives military & first responders discount resources upholstery warranty wood warranty catalog product registration product safety bassett community customer service shipping & delivery return policy preference center bassett credit card online terms privacy accessibility faqs contact us store locator store locator view all stores to the trade dealer site club level by bassett to the trade dealer site club level by bassett be the first to know about new arrivals & special offers footer newsletter invitation footer sign up for newsletter submit facebook pinterest houzz youtube instagram twitter linkedin * click here for sale details. if you don't have adobe® reader® get it here: get adobe® reader® copyright © 2003-2022 bassett furniture industries. all rights reserved. website development by beacon technologies get insider info on newarrivals, big events &special offers. save 30%* slide up newsletter invitation pop-up newsletter sign up submit thank you for signing up! privacy policy new stores in your neighborhood greensboro, nc, 4501 landover drive - now open interested in working with us?
