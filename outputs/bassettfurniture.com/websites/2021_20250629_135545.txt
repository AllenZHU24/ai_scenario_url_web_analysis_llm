there are many types of patio chairs out there. here are a few of the most popular ones to help you narrow down your choices. chaise lounge chair the chaise lounge has long been the seat of choice for kicking back and relaxing. the frame, constructed in a permanent reclining position, and the soft, pillowy cushions support the leisurely uses for which the chair is intended. as the name implies, the lounge chair is perfect for enjoying a carefree sliver of time. swivel lounge chair a swivel lounge chair offers an added dimension to the classic lounge chair. in addition to a comfortable seat and relaxing positioning, the swivel lounge chair allows you to gently swing around and survey the entirety of your glorious backyard wonderland. swivel glider chair move around any which way in these motion-enabling seats. not only can you spin around to take stock of your surroundings, but in swivel glider chairs, you can also take advantage of a smooth, gentle back-and-forth motion for maximum comfort and relaxation. spring lounge chair if you like a chair that moves with you while still providing solid support, consider the spring lounge chair. the spring action tilts the chair to the most accommodating position whenever you shift your weight. the result is an ultra-supportive and comfortable lounging experience. choose your deck chair frame material the next step in finding your perfect outdoor patio chairs is deciding on the type of frame material you like best. our outdoor furniture collection offers choices in wicker, metal, and wood finishes. wicker our outdoor wicker furniture is made from high-performance wicker resin. the synthetic wicker does a much better job handling outdoor elements than it's natural rattan counterpart, without sacrificing the aesthetic appeal of the weaved pattern. metal aluminum is a great choice for outdoor patio chairs. the metal is rust-resistant and is able to easily handle the moisture produced by summer thunderstorms. you won't have to worry about moving these chairs indoor for the winter, either. wood wooden deck chairs never get too hot in the summer or uncomfortably cold in the cooler months. that's because wood does the best job of regulating temperatures. for both comfort and great looks, you can't beat outdoor patio chairs made from wood. completely redesign your outdoor patio need more than just a few chairs?
