tomorrowâ€™s dream room is todayâ€™s trip down discovery lane at bassett. come explore! what should i consider when arranging living room furniture? whether in a small space or an open floor plan, where and how you position your furniture should be a thoughtful reflection of your aesthetic and lifestyle. start by assessing the size and shape of your space, then consider the scale of the furniture pieces you plan to use in that space. your design plan should allow ample distance between each of the pieces and other fixtures, as well as establish a path for traffic through and around the room. family and guests need to be able to enter and exit the seating area freely and without disturbing those who might already occupy the space. more spacious rooms can often accommodate a sprawling sectional, while other living rooms may be better suited to paired sofas or a sofa joined by accent chairs. look for furniture styles that fit your space while also providing enough seating for everyone to comfortably gather, relax, and converse. bassettâ€™s modular and build your own sectionals can offer optimal flexibility, allowing you to customize seating arrangements to suit your personal needs. can i mix furniture sizes? absolutely â€“ but with the same design sense that helps you pair different colors, fabrics, or prints! grouping varied sizes of furniture can help create a dynamic look, visually expand your space, even help your living room escape the â€śblahs.â€? whatâ€™s important is balance, so that your combination is interesting in its variety while not jarring in its juxtaposition. for example, tall wall storage with open shelving can provide a substantial and dramatic backdrop to your seating arrangement, where smaller accent tables can be used to round out a more intimate space for gatherings and conversation if youâ€™d like help mixing furniture pieces or bringing balance to your space, a bassett design expert can answer your questions, provide guidance, and make recommendations that will help you bring your vision to life. do i need a rug in my living room? while itâ€™s not necessary, adding a rug is an excellent way to define your living room space â€“ upping its design quotient while layering in extra comfort. the right size and style rug can visually enlarge a small space or cozy up an open floor plan. and replacing a rug either seasonally or when worn or outdated can revitalize your dă©cor and inspire a fresh perspective. a rug is a powerful design element, often either setting the foundational tone for the overall aesthetic of your room or providing the unifying element when assembling disparate pieces. choosing the right rug can often feel overwhelming, which is why bassett offers both in-store samples and expert design guidance. why should i have a plan for my room design? all good interior design starts with a plan, and your living room should be no exception. as the most visible and high profile gathering space in your home â€“ a true hub â€“ its function needs to answer your daily needs while its style is a conduit of connectivity to the rest of your living space, indoors and out. from choosing furniture, fabrics, and colors to creating a successful floorplan, a comprehensive design plan will help you visualize your ideas to successfully curate an inviting, functional space that reflects your personal style. the bassett furniture room planner is a great tool to get you started. free and simple to use, it allows you to design your room in real time so you can feel confident in your choices. how do i successfully play with patterns in my room? mixing and matching patterns may seem like a difficult design challenge but by following just a few basic principles of color, balance and scale, you can successfully coordinate patterns to achieve a truly personal aesthetic. start by choosing a single, bold pattern for one of your living room pieces (such as a rug or sofa) â€“ this will become the foundation for your design. using the color palette provided by that large pattern, introduce other patterns of varying size and scale throughout the room, both printed and textural. your aim is not to have everything match but, instead, to extend as well as harmonize your design scheme. for example, a large-scale geometric pattern combined with a smaller scale floral can create the piquant and personal look youâ€™re hoping for. keep things manageable by sticking to two or three patterns balanced by and integrated with solids. use wall art, accent pillows, and other home dă©cor pieces to further the connection of each piece to the whole aesthetic. one of the best ways to start your experiment with patterns is by visiting bassettâ€™s fabric workroom. you can order free samples of various patterned and solid fabrics to puzzle out your ideas before you finalize a design plan. whether your personal style is modern, transitional, or eclectic, mixing patterns can yield an enduring and sophisticated design thatâ€™s well worth the effort. . find more ideas and inspiration from the bassett blog. escape the blahs â€“ go for a living room space you love mocha mousse, pantoneâ€™s
