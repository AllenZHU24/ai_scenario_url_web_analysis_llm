beds should last you many years, but due to their long lifespan, beds can be expensive. many costly materials contribute to modern mattress construction. some of these materials include memory foam, wool, organic cotton and latex, and box springs. some mattresses have unique qualities that distinguish them, like hypoallergenic materials, orthopedic benefits, and extra thickness or padding. there's also a small second-hand market for mattresses. not many people want to buy a used mattress. people want a clean, new mattress without any history. if you want to purchase a mattress for less, buy one online. it's much easier to compare prices from retailers online than it is to enter a store and accept the pricing that a particular box store offers you. is a good mattress worth it? a good rule of thumb to live by is: "if you touch it every day, invest some more money into it." with this in mind, we think investing in a good bed is an excellent choice. a mattress is a big life decision. making sure a mattress is comfortable and meets your needs will ensure whether or not you have a good night's sleep. besides, you'll likely pay more money in medical bills tending to the problems that come from a lousy mattress than you will on a good mattress. can a mattress last 20 years? yes, but only if you take good care of it. it's common to replace mattresses every couple of decades. to make your mattresses last longer, always make sure to buy a mattress made with high-quality materials. a memory foam mattress made with high-quality materials can last for many years. edge protection and several layers of foam can also extend the longevity of the mattress. if you need help, please reach out to one of our trained bassett home design specialists. how do i test my bed? the best way to test a mattress is to lie down on a few different beds in-store before purchasing. if you sleep on your back, try lying on your back. if you sleep on your side, lie on your side and imagine you're going to sleep like this. it's important to try and imagine sleeping on this mattress for many years. the decision you make will likely impact the quality of your sleep moving forward. visit us in-store to test out one of the luxury beds from bassett today! how can i create the perfect bed?
