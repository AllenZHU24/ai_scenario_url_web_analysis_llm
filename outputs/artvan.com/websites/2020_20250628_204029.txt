update*** effective april 7, 2020, the chapter 11 cases of art van furniture, llc and related companies (the “art van debtors”) were converted to cases under chapter 7 of the united states bankruptcy code. alfred t. giuliano has been appointed as the chapter 7 trustee (the “trustee”), and pachulski stang ziehl & jones llp is his [proposed] counsel. what happened?when the art van debtors filed their chapter 11 cases on march 8, 2020 (the “petition date”), they intended to close a majority of their stores, liquidate their inventory through store closing sales (the “gob sales”), sell certain of their levin and wolf stores as going concerns (the “going concern sale”), pay down their secured debt and wind up their operations. within a few days after the bankruptcy was filed, covid-19 became a pandemic, and president trump declared a national emergency in response to the covid-19 outbreak. in less than a month, the governors of every state in which the art van debtors operated had ordered citizens to shelter-in-place and closed non-essential businesses. this necessitated the closing of all of the art van debtors’ locations until such time as the shelter-in-place orders are lifted.  as a result, the art van debtors were unable to continue in a chapter 11 reorganization and their cases converted to liquidation cases under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code on april 7, 2020. alfred t. giuliano was appointed the chapter 7 trustee.what happens next?it is the trustee’s job to collect the art van debtors’ assets, sell them and pay creditors’ claims in accordance with the priorities set forth in the united states bankruptcy code. while it is still early in the process, and the covid-19 pandemic has required that the stores stop operating, the trustee anticipates that once the shelter-in-place orders are lifted, he will continue to liquidate the art van debtors’ inventory through gob sales. at present, the trustee cannot state definitively if and when this will occur.  the timing of the gob sales will depend on, among other things, when the stay-at-home orders are lifted in the cities, states and counties in which the stores are located, the ability of the trustee to staff the gob sales given that the art van debtors terminated all of their employees permanently on or about march 20-23, the location and accessibility of the inventory and simply the uncertainties surrounding the conducting of business in post-covid-19 america. please check back here for more information as the process unfolds. consumer questionswhat if i paid for merchandise and did not
