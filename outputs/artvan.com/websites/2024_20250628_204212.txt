vacation rental followfollowfollowfollow you want to own and run an airbnb accommodation. maybe you have an airbnb cabin rental in mind? you have conducted an honest assessment of the property, noted all the property’s flaws, and made necessary repairs. now, it is time to style your airbnb vacation rental, but you are not sure how. here are some expert tips to give you design inspiration. refine your vision what kind of experience would you like your guests to have at your airbnb accommodation? every property has a selling point and knowing what it is will put you in a great position to style and market it to new customers. what is your product? do you provide a spa-like retreat in the countryside? or a buzzing neighborhood with restaurants and bars close by? is it a small town experience – the perfect place to stop and rest on a road trip? is it modern and convenient – ideal for the lone business traveler? or a hip dorm for traveling students on a budget? do not skip this step. refining your vision will determine how you style the accommodation, the kind of guests you attract, and it will make marketing much easier. choosing the perfect color combinations making color combinations that work can be either fun or grueling, depending on whether you enjoy decorating spaces or not. regardless of your passion or lack thereof for interior decorating, there are some useful tips you can follow to create the look and feel of your b&b. to create a modern, sophisticated space, go for darker tones like black and purple which add sophistication and break the weightiness of the space with contrasting tones like white, ivory, beige, tan or cream. adding glass or silver appliances and artifacts also works very well. brown or wooden decorative pieces can add lightness to the space. add a hint of nature or freshness with a living plant. avoid pairing dark tones with strong, bright colors like red unless it works for you. in general, this combination tends to make accommodations look cheap or sleazy. think red light district. complimentary materials include leather, velvet, suede and other rich fabrics. add modern and edgy furniture and artwork to create an upmarket feel. to create an artistic space, experiment with uncommon color combinations. red and pink, yellow and brown, orange with purple and so on. edgy, modern artwork can complete the look and feel. add comfortable but asymmetrical furniture and appliances with interesting design. think mats made from recycled plastic bags, african print place mats, etc. avoid calming colors like black, grey and blue unless paired with very bright, contrasting colors. go for lighter, breathable fabrics and materials like cotton, wool, hemp and so on. to create a family space, “home away from home”, consider warm, earthy combinations like brown and orange, beige and tan. limit the use of very bright colors. splashes here and there can liven the space. furniture and appliances usually look familiar and standard, like a white kettle, a black tv, silver microwave, etc. using standard items can give the feel of being home away from home. this is particularly useful if guests are traveling families that want to maintain a sense of stability and predictability. items that look handmade also add a warm, personal touch to homes. think welcome doormat, woven quilts, etc. family spaces tend to focus more on the functionality of items than aesthetics. in other words, your furniture and appliances need to be more useful than visually pleasant. to create a rustic, countryside space, decorate with natural materials like wood, stones and earthy tones. wooden or laminate flooring, stone walls, crafted front door, a fireplace and antique furniture can create a warm but outdoorsy feel. because rustic furniture and walls can be bold and draw a lot of attention, keep to neutral tones throughout the home so as not to overwhelm the senses. take advantage of any naturally-occurring features like climbing roses and vines, create a water feature from a natural stream, set up a viewing deck, build a bird house or get a couple of peacocks to strut their stuff in the yard. adding homey items like aprons, oven mittens, casserole dishes and firewood can bring a lot to the atmosphere of the airbnb accommodation. to create a coastal space, blue, white and tan will serve you well. this color scheme is typical for coastal accommodations but can be used for inland accommodations as well. play around with earthy materials like burlap and wood. handcrafted decorative pieces and simple, local artwork are recommended. the key to making a space feel coastal, whether it is on the beachfront or not, is air flow. wider sliding doors, spacious balconies and even a skylight can help with this. play around with decorative items like pebbles, shells and artefacts associated with the sea. to create a mini-resort, you may need to build several recreational areas. creating a space that feels like a small resort requires multiple places of interest for guests. consider having a separate pool and jacuzzi area, a gazebo, a barbecue area, campsites, a viewing deck, a walking trail and more. multiple recreational areas keep guests excited and eager to explore. they also encourage large groups to stay longer. this is recommended for accommodations in the countryside and small towns. once you have decorated your space according to the vision, decide which amenities and facilities you will offer guests. it is advisable that whatever you choose to offer keeps with the theme
