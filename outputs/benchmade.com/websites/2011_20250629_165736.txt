-matthew h. key words: product (military) last summer while in iraq i was working as a medical plt sgt at a cop south of bagdad. we got a call in that a hmmwv rolled over and was upside-down in a canal. turns out four troops were stuck for more than 5 minutes with limited air and the driver was unable to free himself and had inhaled water.well were expected the worst and called the chaplain and prepared airway management got some body bags. turns out the team all walked in to the bas soon thereafter all wet from head to smelling like fecal matter but all alive. the driver was unable to release himself from the seatbelt due to panic concussion and loss of vision. the sfc behind the driver was able to use his benchmade and released the driver from behind him and they were freed minutes later from the vehicle. although the driver suffered pneumonia and serious psychological issues the use for body bags was not needed that day."aut viam inveniam aut faciam" -rich b. key words: product (military) we were actually issued the benchmade belt cutter in iraq. i am glad to tell you that this tool helped rescue soldiers. while on mission we had a serious roll over in which the gunner was stuck in his harness. my sergeant and i were first on the scene and with a gasoline leak there was little time to get everyone out of the truck. the belt cutter sliced through the straps like butter and we had everyone out in less than two minutes. so keep up the good work you guys are doing and thank you. -sean d. key words: product (military) it is a rarity that i write to a company about their product. in the military, soldiers have a propensity to collect knives, tools, and gadgets in general. i, however, am not one of collection flock. iâve always thought if it works soldiers will keep it, if not, you will find it on the ground behind them because it isnât worth carrying. i received a stryker-auto knife from my chief maintenance warrant prior to going overseas to iraq. some how it was just appropriate that a stryker unit bought the stryker- auto knife. in a year of combat, the stryker-auto served me in snow, rain, extreme heat, dust, dirt, and grime. it never jammed, fail to open, or fail to lock. that alone is truly a remarkable feat in that environment. i can honestly say that the stryker-auto saved my life and that of my fellow soldiers on at least one occasion. the knife is now one of my most cherished possessions and travels everywhere i go in uniform. thank you! as a result of my extreme fondness for your product, iâm returning it to you temporarily for maintenance; no doubt like my chief warrant would want me to. iâm enclosing a check for 40.00 dollars to cover return shipment and replacement of the blade that is chipped along the serrated edge. under no circumstances are you to replace the handle. the handle has far too many scratches, dings, and dents that remind me of where i have been and more importantly the soldiers i have proudly shared the field of battle with. -kevin s. key words: customer service thanks for all the e-mails,and your time. im one happy customer. -paul a. key words: product (military) i am currently serving in iraq. while on a night flight working with task force members i lost my model 9100 sbt. i would like to purchase another one as this has to be the best knife i have ever owned. i have owned sog's, randal"s and buck knives. not only do i count on it for self defense but the tanto point will help me in the event of a survivable crash should i need to cut my way thru the aircraft outer skin. the one hand operation speaks for itself. if i were stateside i'd have the luxury of replacing the knife quickly. any information you could send me so i can replace this knife and give me that sense of security again would be greatly apprieciated. -ssg christopher b. key words: product (military) i am an oregonian (salem) who has been serving in the army for 21 years, and rarely have i had an opportunity to tell someone what i thought of their product. i decided benchmade would be my first. first, your knives are by far superior over any others i have used. i took a model 940 with me into combat and it served flawlessly. it maintained it's edge after more uses than i thought possible. it exited the aircraft with me on numerous airborne operations and withstood the impacts. sadly on my last deployment it was lost or stolen, but i plan to replace it soon. my hat (beret) is off to your company and it's great products, and your support of the military. thank you from us to you! -sfc l. s. key words: product (general) i just have to let someone know how much i enjoy your products.( i have a small collection of case knives in a display case on my dresser. ) i saw your 670 apparition in the ki issue on assisted openers, and though i had no knives of this style, i just had to have one. when i received, opened, and held it, i thought it was the most beautiful knife i had ever seen. the beautiful scales, the polished bolsters, the lovely blade, the smooth assisted opening. this knife feels good to the hand too. the quality is terrific. i have since purchased a 910 stryker, an opportunist, 551 griptillion, and have a 420 resistor on order. it's quite possible that my 551 will be the only one i actually use. thanks for such a well built, attractive knive. please consider me a huge fan of benchmade knives. -robert s. key words: product (general) i recently purchased a benchmade model #670 apparition and i am very satisfied and pleased with my purchase. the fit and finish is very good and the knife fills the hand. this knife has the stones to be a reliable an every day carry. i look forward to the mail catalog and purchasing future benchmade knives for my collection. -steve b. key words: product (general) when i was twelve years old my father bought me the cqc7. i am now 22 and i still use that knife on a regular basis. i am a avid camper /hiker /outdoor enthusiast and i can honestly say this is the best knife i have ever come across. i am first of all writing to tell you how satisfied a customer you have made. i will always be devoted to benchmade. second of all i amwriting because after ten years of regular use the blade is in need of sharpening. i have no record of purchase or warranty information and i was just wondering if you could help me out anyways. i didnt try to get it sharpened before becuase i didnt want to be with out it. please email me to let me know if you can help me. thank you -dave v. key words: product (military) i was using this knife in iraq and broke the tip of the blade off. this thing has gotten me and my men out of a bind more than once. i was wanting to know if i could mail it in for repair, is it possible to fix or do i need to buy a new one. thanks in advice for one hell of a good product, i've never met a marine yet that wasnât 110% satisfied with the quality and craftsmanship of these knives. ill never own anything but a benchmadeâ¦thanks againâ¦respectfully sgt kincaidâ¦us marinesâ â  semper fi -sgt. shannon k. key words: warranty thanks so much for helping me replace the broken screw on my bali-song. i very much appreciate the time your company has taken provide a quality product and making the customer feel important. -allan p. key words: product (general) i bought a 425 gravitator. the next was a 3550 pardue. these are the best made knives i have ever seen. i had a question about my pardue 3550, it answered the next day on e-mail. awsome service!! my father told me he would dis-own me if i bought another benchmade. i told him to get the paperwork started. he just laughed, he appreciates a good knife as much as i do. -william c. key words: warranty i just got my 730cfhs back from benchmade and i am very impressed. they did everything i asked which included sharpening and centering the blade along with replacing all the washers and screws. it took about four weeks to get it back but it was definitely worth it. thanks bm! -benchmade community member - mouldycrow360 key words: customer service the only thing more impressive then your service is the knives you make -robert key words: product (general) recently spent two weeks assisting with the recovery process in innisfail (an hour south or cairns) after tropical cyclone larry. we were covering an area the size of tasmania. the 710 ive carried with me for close to three years was brilliant, working at heights in full climbing gear it proved to be the perfect knife for one handed operation as full automatics are illegal in australia. i couldnt have asked for a better companion and it allowed me to work more safely and efficiently. it will be sent over soon for sharpening and i look forward to having it razor sharp again, its a knife that has been used and abused but has never given up on me. cheers guys -john h. key words: product (general) a year or two ago my son sent me a benchmade 732 and i think it is as good as it gets as far as cutlery goes! the g10 handle is incredible as is the locking system. i think it is as strong as a folder can be ~ what a magnificent piece of the cutler's art! i ordered a model #156bt camp knife and am going to send it to my son and i know he will be as proud of it as i am of my 732! thanks to all at benchmade for your incredible products. -john c. key words: product (military) i appriciate the time that you have put into my order. i just want to tell you that my knife had arrived today and i thank you greatly for the time that it took in making the knife. i also would like to say that i used benchmade knives when i served over in afghanistan. so again, thank you for the time and effort in the knife you had made for me! -spc adam n. key words: product (general) i love your knives. i have used a lot of upper end knives for hunting. yours are the best. in fact now i judge other hunters by the knife they carry. if it is not a benchmade, i wonder how serious they really are. -martin k. key words: product (general) i wanted to start off by saying that your nimravus cub (140) saved my life and for that i am very thankful. i was working mapping a grid and having lunch alone in points north canada , when i found i was being watched by four wolves. before i could find a large enough tree to climb one of the wolves had run up and got its teeth into my rucksack and left arm but missed the arm and got only down jacket. with my right hand free i was able to get my sheridan off my leg and fight off the attack. when my radio came back on the wolves were distracted buy my radio and my rucksack. i sprinted the 800 meters back to camp only to find that in the struggle i lost my knife. the next day on the grid i searched to same spot many times over in hopes of finding my loved knife in the deep snow with no luck. i take great pride in having the best and most reliable equipment available and the nimravus cub is the very best knife i have ever had. with a two week old baby i will have to save up for a new nimravus but i wont return to the north with out a benchmade. thank you again for making such exceptional survival tools. -tony m. key words: customer service i appreciate your continued professionalism as it marks well the products you sell. -jason r. key words: warranty thank you so much for your excel!ent customer services. of all the major knife manuafacturers, you are the best! -ted c. key words: warranty i emailed about a month or so ago asking about what it would take to purchase a pocket clip and i received it in the mail today i really expected to get a reply with ordering info i must say i am very impressed with such great service. thank you. -tracy m. key words: warranty i sent my best friend in to have a spring replaced and got more than i asked for. i have a mchenry & williams that had a broken spring in the axis lock. a short while later my knife was returned with the spring fixed and a few upgrades added, in addition to a thorough cleaning. the benchmade warranty department is the best there is. without even asking, you guys sharpened the blade, cleaned several years of crud off the scales and from the insides, replaced the plastic shims (?) on either side of the blade with brass shims (?) and even straightened out the pocket clip by restoring the factory cure to the clip. not to mention endured a couple of calls from goofy street cop who was missing his partner. my only complaint was that the angle on the pocket clip was intentional and it was to prevent it from hanging on the seatbelt when i got out of the car. (i am a lefty who carries the knife in my weak side (right pocket) you guys did not know that i had straightened out the final curve on the pocket clip, so no harm no foul). i cannot fault a company who sees a problem and takes the initiative to fix the same. i intend to sing your praises to who ever will listen. -patrolman shannon b. key words: product (military) my name is john with naval special clearance team one... i would like to thank benchmade for their products, service, and sales representatives for all that you do for us in the u.s. military. i would especially like to thank you for sending your fed/gov rep, his expertise and professionalism further contributed to our strong desire to use benchmade products. -john r., qm1 (swcc/sw) key words: product (military) i would like to take a minute to say thanks for the quality knife i received during preâdeployment issue for iraq. i was issued a benchmade 9053 sbk. although this knife was a treasured issue item it received little use during my first deployment. however during my second deployment then i realized just how valuable a quality knife is. after being ambushed by insurgents just south of baghdad we had a team member down. in a rush to remove the member's body armor i grabbed my benchmade and began cutting. with little or no problem the benchmade cut the kevlar material to aid in removing the vest. although our efforts at first aid were in vain, your benchmade knife greatly eased our attempts to save a us soldier's life. thanks for making a quality product available to the us military. -ssgt kevin g. key words: product (military) i wanted to say thank you. i am a pilot for the us army. we keep knives like the mini reflex auto in our survival kits and gear. too often these knives break, bend, chip, the usual. a few of us went out and spent some money, now we all have benchmade knives that we carry with us. it feels good to know that if something were to happen, we have a knife that will stand up to the test. and for that i want to say thanks! cheesy, maybe, but when you hear a story about a pow who used his benchmade in combat, and now we all have one, it's great. -w01 kimberly c. key words: product (military) i just wanted to send you guys a note to say that you guys kick asssssss!!!!!!â  benchmade is by far the best knife company out there and atâ a time when i was trying to figure out which knife to buy for my first knife i met the guys on your team and was very impressed and then i heard many stories about your customer service and i was sold.â  consider me a life customer, i'll never buy a knife from anyone else!!â  keep up the good work supporting law enforcement, military, and the nra.â  benchmade is #1. -levi w. key words: product (military) thank you for your support of the armed forces, i've been a collector of your products for years now and i've only seen the highest quality from what i've purchased. take care, semper fi! -lcpl kevin m. key words: product (military) wow now that's a knife (model 610). i just bought this knife and am amazed at the quality and craftsmanship. thanks, this is one of about a dozen benchmades that i own and you guys just keep making them better every year. i sent my son to iraq with two nimravuses and an afo and they served him very well as a member of the 3rd i.d. -larry p. key words: product (military) i am a soldier that just got back from a year deployment in iraq, and i must say out of probably 100 or more knives i have owned and used in my life, none can compare to your benchmade i used often while in iraq. -ssg david w. key words: product (military) i just received my 9050 afo, auto; what a class act. absolutely one of the finest knifes i have ever seen. this will make a "at times shall we say tense job" a lot less tense! i appreciate the made in america label and am grateful for the support. a customer and promoter for life. thanks again and definitely not my last purchase. -jack a., usaf key words: product (military) i just wanted to say thank you for your support of the military and producing such flawless knives. i am currently deployed in support of operation iraqi freedom. it's a shame more companies that make products like yours don't support their own people as much as you do. happy new year. -a1c sebastian w. key words: product (military) i have had one of your rescue hooks now for a while. i am a hospital corpsman stationed with a marine unit in fallujah. the other day i was presented with the nightmare task of treating a handful of injured marines. they were traveling through the city and hit with and ied, a very common problem. once they reached my location my fellow corpsman and i launched into action and instantly began treating the critical injuries. due to the excellent design and quality of your rescue hook i was able to tear through a flack vest, cammo blouse, t-shirt, and camel back and save the time that was needed to save the young marines life. due to the speed that i was able to rid him of his flack vest and shirts, i was able to save his life. he is now on his way to recovery. i just wanted to say thank you for producing such a wonderful life saving tool. as a matter of fact, my chief was so impressed of the job that your rescue hook had done, he has decided to order, i believe, 70 rescue hooks and their hard shell snapâtight sheaths. i have done nothing but talk them up to all of my fellow combat medics around me. they canât wait to get theirs. on behalf of all the marines that i have had to use my rescue hook on, thank you for the quality and efficiency of your product. -hospital corpsman ryan m. key words: product (military) i am a us navy corpsman stationed in iraq. the other day we had some casualties and one of our corpsman utilized your model 5 rescue hook. along with the medic training and the model 5 rescue hook to expose injuries help to save the lives of marines and sailors injured. -michael q. key words: product (military) i am a active duty member of the united states army. i have just returned from operation iraqi freedom and would like to thank you for your services. i was issued a model 5 rescue hook while in theater and it enabled me to help save a fellow soldiers life. i think it is a great product. i however lost it with my model 553 tanto. it also was a dependable knife and worked when i needed it the most. i thank you for all you do for the soldiers in this fine nation..... -eugene s. key words: product (military) i have a benchmade knife, which appears to be very similar to the 9050 afo. since i received the knife on a deployment to saudi a couple of years ago, this thing has been rock solid. i have put this knife through pure torture, and it has been the one knife that i haven't been able to destroy. except for lately, while on post i was trying to do some "field maintenance" on a heating and cooling unit. using my knife for utility like i should not have been, i accidentally touched the blade to a 220 volt power source. luckily, i was not shocked, but needless to say the blade was more or less "welded" with a chunk taken out of the blade edge. i am not sure what the warranty is for these, but i am positive that this misuse would not be covered. i was just wondering what the cost would be for replacing the blade, and possibly refinishing the entire knife. over the years, this knife has seen lots of scratches, drops, etc... i really do not want to get rid of this knife, as i have said before this thing has performed flawlessly in some of the worst working conditions that i could expect, and has a sort of sentimental attachment to it. any help you could provide would be great. thanks again for your help. -will n. key words: product (military) it has been almost a year since the event that brought me into benchmade happened. i talked with my unit a bit, and here is what i can share. on an undisclosed road spanning both kuwait and iraq, i was on patrol with two other marines. we were driving slowly in the middle of what seemed to be an endless hostile desert when something blew out the back tire on our hmmwv. we were unable to drive away because the rubber flap of the tire was hitting the wheel well so hard it was causing damage. we pulled to the side, set up a hasty perimeter, and attempted to cut it off using our k-bar knives (that was all we had at the time). in trying to cut through the steel belts which laced through the tread, we broke a blade on one. i pulled a folding benchmade knife from my pocket which i have had for ten years and said to myself it was time to find out if the money i paid for this knife was worth it. it was a struggle, but the knife cut the steel belts and tire flap without breaking the blade or even dulling the knife significantly. all three of us were amazed. we drove down the road to a safer area where we took the picture shown holding the knife near the tire. i vowed i would personally thank benchmade for their quality when i returned to the states. the two other marines with me told me that was going to be their first purchase when they got back. a month after a wonderful homecoming, i drove up to oregon city with my knife and told my story to benchmade personally. there were days when i didn't think that time would come and it was an awesome experience. though it was a small event in a series of much larger ones, a mere pocket knife i have trusted for a decade came through for me when i needed it most. i have, in the past, gotten criticized for how much i paid for this knife, but those very same people are devout benchmade owners today. to benchmade, i would say this. many of your knife owners buy your knives in case they have a moment where they need them not to fail. thank you for taking the time to make your knives for those moments as well as common everyday use. there is no other knife i would trust with me anywhere in the world then yours. i am now a police officer and carry two with me on every shift and everyone that knows me knows there is no other knife company in the world whose products are as reliable in extraordinary situations as well as everyday ordinary ones. -ethan s. key words: product (law enforcement) i just this morning received my automatic benchmade knife back from your repair department. i had sent it in due to not opening properly and also had requested sharpening. i felt compelled to let you know my knife works just like new, is as sharp as new, and i am very proud to have it back in a timely manner. having carried this knife for several years both on the job as a law enforcement officer and off the job as well, i discovered just how much i use it by doing without it for a couple of weeks. thanks for making a great product and for providing repair and support in a timely manner for your product. -steven d. key words: product (law enforcement) just wanted to drop a line and tell everyone at benchmade what a great company you have, i sent my old trustworthy benchmade automatic in for warranty work last month, mind you i am a deputy sheriff and am not the easiest person on knives (benchmade has cut many a people free from seatbelts after crashes) anyway i send my knife in which probably should have been buried anyway as i had beat it to death and today i check my mail and find a brand new benchmade model 2550s and an explanation that my old knife had been too damaged to fix. well i say good going guy's, it is really nice to see a company that has such nice customer service and backs their work, i hope the boss reads this because i called a couple times to check on my knife (felt kinda naked without it) and every time was greeted with very professional, kind people. benchmade you have gained a life long customer out of me, as a matter of fact, i know what i am giving for christmas..........thank you -paul comer key words: product (law enforcement) i think that i got my knife back in 1996 or 1997. i have used it in all kinds of weather and situations, and it has proven to be up to any and all tasks. i enclosed a picture from the demolition training, at range 69 at fort bragg. i used the knife to cut plastic bottles or aluminum cans apart. the benchmade knife was able to cut the aluminum cans, the c-4 blocks, the wooden rod used to tamp the explosives into the bottle, and the detonation cord used to prime the charge. thanks again for the great knife and service on it. i can't wait to get it back, ready for more hard duty! -de o. jr. key words: product (law enforcement) five years ago my wife gave me the knife of my choice as a graduation present from the us customs inspector basic training academy. after doing my research i requested a benchmade 9100s automatic. since then, during the interdiction of 728 kilos of cocaine, 477 kilos of heroin and various other infractions, the knife has proved it's self over and over. when the tip of the blade snapped off, a call to your service center was all that was needed. in about two weeks i had a brand new replacement. i am committed to telling everyone about your product. thank you from america's frontline. -orlando s. key words: product (law enforcement) a co-worker and i were called to attend a group home where a suicidal youth had barricaded himself in his room and had apparently cut himself. on our arrival we found the door key locked and barricaded. fearing the youth was still armed with a knife i deployed a taser and proceeded to kick down the door. we entered and as i swept the room i saw the young man. he had tied a belt from a bathrobe around the bar in his closet and had tied a slipknot around his neck. the youth was starting to turn purpleâblue. with my right hand full i had no choice but to draw my left handed afck (original, round-hole, pre-axis) from my pants pocket. the blade came open as i reached out and slashed through the belt in one swipe. the young man fell to the floor and my partner and i quickly removed the remains of the belt from around his neck. certainly, i could have transitionned the taser to my left hand and pulled my right handed knife, but i decided when i started policing that i would be properly prepared for any situation. i carry a matching set of afck's for just that purpose. in a situation that could have been much worse, having a sharp knife ready to deploy with either hand shaved precious seconds that could have tipped the scale. thanks for building and selling lifeâsaving products like my afcks. -cst (ben) p. key words: product (law enforcement) recently i sent my axis / mc henry & williams knife in to have the blade re sharpened as part of your life-sharp program. it had been my trusted friend and had seen service on a daily basis. it returned today and, i can't thank you enough. it is "factory fresh". please convey my thanks to everyone at benchmade. you are great! now let me tell you how much i like your product. prior to the mc henry & williams axis model that i have, i had the previous mc henry & williams model i don't remember the model number but it didn't have the axis lock mechanism. it was a great knife and i lost it. after searching and retracing my steps for two day, i gave up and bought the new m & w axis model because i couldn't go without a good knife. the next day, i found the old one, it had fallen of the seat of my truck where i had left it. well i gave it to my brother, he had it "rehabed" buy sending it to you and now, he cant live without it. i have also given your osborne axis model to my wife as a gift and she carries at work, (police detective). your products are greatly enjoyed by two (retired) police officers and one current one. thanks for making such a quality product and standing behind it. -greg s. key words: product (law enforcement) i began my career in law enforcement just over 3 years ago. coming in as a new agent, barely scraping by i was still required to provide some of my own equipment. i needed a versatile, fixed-blade knife to use hard on a daily basis. i did a bit of research and came upon your elishewitz-designed nimravus 140 sbt. the $140.00 price tag seemed steep at the time, but after resigning myself to top ramen for a month, i made the purchase. i never imagined still fielding this knife three years later. it has even served well as a survival knife in the pacific northwest and the comboblade was well used cutting down many cedar saplings, and the extruded tang ensured that driving the knife through the wood made excellent firewood and kindling, without once touching the g-10 handle. i'll leave it at that but suffice to say, the only wear marks are in the blade coating. i have neglected addressing the blade for some time but haven't been willing to part with it. i purchased a cheaper competitor's fixed blade to do so and it literally lasted through two shifts before snapping the tip off!!! i plan on using your knife until it's worn down to a toothpick. i should be retired by the time that happens!!! in the meantime, i see that this knife is no longer in production. i would sure love to find an updated kydex holster for this knife if possible. the only gripe i've ever had is the narrowness of the sheath attachment point. it's hard as hell to stuff onto a two-inch wide duty belt, even though it is sized for it. thank you for your time as well as quality of work and attention to detail. you are well represented in the dangerous work of law enforcement! -brandon l. key words: product (general) i'm just starting to collect your knives again, and they're oh so sweet. i'm very partial to anything with an axis lock. i once had a 921 and 942, but sold them. i wish i still had both since they're now discontinued. i was without a single benchmade knife for a long time, but now i'm back on board! i started with a 42 baliâsong, what a great knife! there's just no other way to describe it. it's exactly what a bali should be. the new 32 morpho is definitely next on my list. next, i bought a new 154cm 710, and that's what got me back to loving the precision and agility of the axis lock again. i got so excited about having benchmades again that i ordered 3 at once: a 551 griptilian, 556 mini griptilian blue, and 707 sequel to go with my 710. it's like christmas morning! now i'm faced with which one to carry with me today. i think i may alternate hourly, hahaha! also, the other day, i met a guy at a garage who had an old beat up 730 clipped to his pocket. he didn't know much about the knife, nor knives in general, but he loved it. i educated him on the name ares. and when i showed him the 710 in my pocket he was astonished to meet someone else carrying a benchmade knife. "a benchmade knife is the best knife in the world" he said, and i nodded in agreement. well i just wanted to say keep up the good work. i like where the company is going. the seemingly constant flow of new models and improvement of old ones is great! i'll be watching for the next great axis lock knife! -alex l. key words: product (general) i look forward to your productions this year, and i am currently interested in the rukus, although it is no replacement for my 806sd2!! keep up the good work. hopefully, sometime in the future, we can look for a limited run or perhaps a revival of the 806. i know i will keep my eyes and ears open! -bradley s. key words: product (general) this is from brazil. my name is thomaz, iâm a neurosurgeon, knife lover and bought my 1st benchmade (a griptilian 551s) this week - itâs like surgical tool that i use - extremely sharp and very resistant. my friends already told me that benchmade is top of line in cutlery but here in brazil, itâs very hard to find/buy great products like yours - we have no benchmade dealer in brazil on near countries. if i want to buy a benchmade folder, iâll need to ask a friend that is traveling to bring it to me. congratulations by you excellent knife. my next one will be a auto resistor 4200 (snody) - soon! -thomaz r. key words: product (general) dear benchmade, today i received a 610 rukus in black and i am so excited about the weight, the fit and finish, the blade all of it is perfect. please thank the owner, and those who built it. 4 years ago i purchased an afck and i still wear it today; i hope to collect many more bm's. -scott g. key words: product (general) hi i have had my benchmade d2 steel version 705â02 mchenry & williams for about a year now and it has been through alot...its been dropped numerous times been in sand, water, mud and snow, cut through drywall, insulation, wire, and probably the most demanding on a blade was cutting the drip edge, and gutters on one of my buddies houses, before i started the job we didn't have any tin snips so i decided to see how my benchmade held up to the job... so i checked it and it would shave my arm without any problem so we went through out the day with me making all the cuts i needed including some 2 at a time cuts, then cut a few extra pieces just because i wanted to test it good!!! at the end of the day i went to check how sharp my blade was and i looked at it part of the bt2 coating was rubbed off and scratches on the blade, but it still shaved my arm as well as before is started!! the axis lock is still good as new and works flawlessly even after being in sand water mud snow and everything else you encounter when youâre off the road. -daryl f. key words: product (general) for a long time i have been searching for a good knife that i could take out on the river boating. after months of research i decided to buy your model 100sh2o - river/dive. i live in alaska where there are many rivers lakes and ponds, so the need for a good water resistant knife is of the utmost. about a month ago i was out fishing and drooped the knife in the water and at the time i could not find it. i told a buddy of mine that if you are out near that area to look for it. well after 2 weeks my buddy came back with the knife and to my surprise the knife was as good as new. there was a touch of rust near the handle but with a clean dry rag it wiped clean and now you would never know that it was lying in the bottom of a small lake. i have bought many stainless steal knifes in my time and some (i should say most) even after washing the knives if you do not dry them off they will rust. but this knife stands the test of time, and i would call it the only nonârusting knife in the world. -jacob w. key words: product (general) i have had several well-known knives over the years, but about 7 years ago i knocked the tip off the knife i had carried for about one year. i liked it but the blade was serrated the whole length which was not to my liking. a few weeks later i was at the local px and saw two benchmade folders. i chose what turned out to be the best little friend i could have (in a tool). it fit perfectly in my pocket clipped. it was an instant marriage. that ended a couple of weeks ago. i was returning home from a short trip and forgot to stow it with my luggage. needless to say i had to part with it, i begged the security officers to take my name address and phone number and i would compensate them. i offered more than i paid. they informed me i needed to get a new knife; funny some people just don't understand how you can get attached to a tool. well after a ton of searching it seems that model must have been discontinued. and of course i don't know the model it was, just that it said 440 on the blade besides benchmade. trust me on this i could pick it out of a line up blind folded. it helped me with my hunting and fishing duties on several occasions plus countless other ways. i will get another benchmade but the forty dollars or so and seven or more years i had with my first is not replaceable. i don't want to replace it but in her true fashion it wasn't because she failed me, but me her. -robert n. key words: product (general) many years ago i received the afck with the liner lock, it was the best knife i had ever owned, the handle fit my hand perfectly, and the quality was amazing. not to mention your customer service was topânotch. i sent it back many times to be cleaned, sharpened and repaired and it always came back like new. sadly i lost it working one day. since then (about 5 years ago) i have longed for the new afck axis lock, but could never bring myself to pay the extra. when i recently found out that the model had been discontinued, i began a desperate scramble to find a dealer that still had some in stock. finally, after three failed attempts, i ordered one online, and i received it today. i have a decent amount of experience with knives, and have owned many over the years, and i can honestly say i have never been so impressed with a knife. the construction is flawless, it is solid and sturdy, the action is fluid and clean, and for the first time in my experience, i purchased a blade that was literally razor sharp. it shaved the hair from my arm like a brand new razor. i was amazed. i cannot say enough about this knife, and it was worth every penny. my whole family owns benchmade knives, and they are all jealous of my new purchase. it's a shame that this model has been discontinued, but i am so glad i managed to get my hands on one. it is one tough knife. thanks to everyone at benchmade for all the great work. this knife is fantastic! -ian f. key words: product (general) i am a benchmade owner, and my next purchase will probably be the beautiful 960slv (maybe i'll get it for christmas). you guys and gals make the very best! thank you. for everyday use, i carry a griptilian with black scales (i'm in a wheelchair so i have a nice large backpack in which to haul my stuff). i work at a university hospital and when i retrieve my knife for some task, it is a little ominous looking. the bright colors that the mini griptilian are/were offered in were a little loud for my taste. i would like to see the griptilian series offered in classic colors such as navy blue, dark green, and/or burgundy (deep wine). i would be the first to buy a navy blue version. i know it is all about business (sales) and you probably get unwanted suggestions everyday. i apologize for being another one of those knowâitâall people, but i could not resist sharing my thoughts with you. i really do love your products. -mike l. key words: product (general) i bought a 10500 rant bowie pardue knife about two years ago after seeing how sharp a friend's benchmade knife was. i have cleaned one elk and about 75 geese with it, still sharp (other than one nick when i loaned it to a friend). anyway, because of the quality and fit, i bought another one. they are great knives! -david f. key words: product (general) i received my benchmade yesterday and am extremely pleased with the work you have done on it. as far as i'm concerned there is no other knife around that compares to benchmade. as a matter of fact i just purchased an auto stryker from the blade company in knoxville, tenn. now i have a knife for each pocket. my problem is this, what do i do for my 2 back pockets? seriously i am a proud owner of 2 benchmades and they will be passed on to my grandsons in the future. thank you very much for the service. it is really appreciated, as is your product. -nicholas c. key words: product (general) i'm a college student in georgia. i recently purchased a benchmade knife, and i don't think i'll ever buy another brand. everyone i show the knife to says "wow, you have a benchmade?! nice!" i was writing to ask if you guys have any stickers and posters for my truck and dorm room. anything would be appreciated. -stephen s. key words: product (general) i will keep watch on your website and hopefully you guys will make the 610 rukus in automatic one day. until them i am confident my standard 610 rukus will keep me happy, along with my mini stryker auto! and oh, talk about wow! i just found your 670dmsfa! that is the holy grail of knives! simply awesome! keep up the good work! -tom m. key words: product (general) i've been needing a set of kitchen knives for a couple of years and have held off knowing that sooner or later you would come out with one good knife, or a set. my waiting paid off. when i saw the new prestigedges set in the catalogue, i rushed down to my local dealer and ordered it. when i brought the set home i couldn't wait to show my fiancã© our new toys for the kitchen. now she knows why i only carry your pocket knives and have gotten rid of all others made by someone else. our new knives are always on the cutting board or in the dish rack drying from being used so much. their cutting performance has been great and i know the steel they are made of will not allow the sharp edge to dull any time soon. i can already foresee the next time when both of our mothers come to visit what each of them will want for their mother's day present. thanks benchmade for once again making a great product that will last me all my days, and can be proud to one day pass them on to my children. -brian w. key words: product (general) i have recently acquired several of your benchmade knives, and am very impressed with them! i was so impressed that i took the time to photograph them "in the wild", so to speak, and write up a brief review of each. i was motivated to do so because as i was trying to make my purchasing decisions and was scanning the web, the few reviews and pictures i found online were very helpful to me, and i wanted to pass along my positive experience with your knives to anyone else who might be in the same boat i found myself. furthermore, i went to the trouble for the auto and assisted auto knives of creating little "mini mpeg movies", showing them in my hand and opening. when i was doing my online research before purchasing, i had found just one other site that contained little movies like that, and it was very helpful to me. i was able to get a sense of how the knives actually would fit into my hand, and what they look, sound, and even "feel" like, when they open. the comments i received in the forum threads echo those sentiments. i really believe mpeg movies are a great addition to the marketing material for autos and assisted autos. the reviews i did cover the mini pika, the mini griptilian 556, the apparition 670, and the mini presidio 5500. they can be seen at http://benchmadeforum.com/ -elliott j. key words: product (general) just wanted to let you know how indispensable my benchmade has become. i carry it concealed and in a very close location...one where weight has always been a consideration. i have carried a competitor's product there as a backup for several years and was happy with the light weight, but wanted to try the knife i got from you, even though it weighs much more than the "other brand". i carried my benchmade for a time and then, one night, as i was getting ready for work, i wimped and went back to the lightweight. that lasted one shift. i have "taught" my hands the best way to reach and use the benchmade and it is many, many times the knife the other guys make. it feels right in my hands. it takes a very good edge, and holds it. even though i like "light", i prefer quality and reliability. the benchmade gravitator is hands down the best folder i have ever carried. thanks for making the best there is. -alan yates key words: product (general) i recently purchased a display model of an emerson benchmade cqc7 975. it being a display model, it has never been ground to a sharp edge. i'm hoping that i will be able to send it to you and have it sharpened under the life sharp service offered. i would just like to make sure that this is possible to be done. this is my second benchmade and i love your quality. -brad p. key words: product (general) i've been a customer for about 7 years, and probably now for life. i currently own 2 benchmades, and look forward to purchasing my 3rd one in the near future. they are hands down the best knives that iâve ever purchased. thanks again for your great products! -eric r. key words: product (general) i recently purchased model 220 the fixed resistor from a separate dealer, and it is truly awesome. i think i've got a new favorite knife. i am a picky collector of quality knives too, mostly folders but a few fixed blade knives, and own several other benchmade knives, which i consider some of my best in quality. my collection isn't just show knives; mostly i prefer to buy useful and sturdy knives that i can use and i do use about all of my knives. when i first saw a picture of the fixed resistor i must say it caught my eye. it looked great and well designed for actual use, but i was a little uncertain since you can't always tell from the picture. i kept returning to look at it and check it out online and it looked like it would make a great field knife. i am often in the wilderness with my knives in my work as a field biologist, as well as my hobbies of climbing and backpacking. i guess i couldn't resist the resistor's pleasing lines, so i placed an order. it definitely lived up to my highest expectations. the knife is perfect in balance and fits your hand like a glove. the scales/handle material is a perfectly textured gâ10, not too rough feeling like most gâ10 finishes seem to be. the blade is a perfect working design and can be choked up on easily and comfortably for any working angle. it isn't quite as long as i thought it would be, but it is a good medium size, with an actual cutting length of about 3 and 1/8 inches. the sheath is well designed and i love the multiple attachment options, it would even work great strapped to your calf as a backup or whatever. the sheath sticks solidly to the knife with dimples inside it to mate with the last paired screws in the handle. i am so happy with it; it will make a great knife for just about any use i could think of. thank you benchmade for constructing the knife of my dreams. i couldn't think of any knife available on the market today in its price range or lower that i would want more. thanks. -anonymous key words: product (general) i just got in, 0200 on the 23rd of september from a round robin throughout georgia, alabama and other points. my wife had ordered a "snody gravitator" for me before i left, and it was shown as "back-ordered"...but it was on the counter when i walked in here at home. it's a beautiful piece of work, and is as i pictured it being when i saw the stats on it in your catalogue. thanks from a very satisfied customer...now and in the future. -alan y. key words: product (general) i just wanted let you know my friends and i believe you make the best production knives in the world, i'm just starting to collect and 4 years ago i purchased a afck in black and the smaller one, to this day both knives perform top form, i'm looking forward till may when i will be buying a rukus, i'm very excited about it. thanks you for building such bitchen knifes. -scott g. key words: product (general) a little late note that i've been meaning to send. about four or five years ago i was coming home from work one morning when one of my tires went onto the shoulder going into a curve. it had been very cold for about a week and the shoulder was hard and slick. i was not able to bring the tire back up onto the road and the car slid into a ditch, rolled over and flipped and finally came out close to the road with me hanging upside down. the seat belt mechanism wouldn't come loose and i was getting pretty uncomfortable when i remembered the afck i always carried with me. a quick swipe and i was down and out the door. fortunately for me the only injury (very slight) i received was when the blade went through the safety belt before i was ready and i landed on my head! i no longer have that particular knife but i have had a benchmade with me ever since. thanks and keep up the good work. -jeff m. key words: product (general) i wanted to take a moment to let you know that i own a number of your knives and usually carry one everyday. the reason is that not only are they a handy tool, they look great and the fit and quality is unsurpassed. i'm an engineer by profession and can't help but have an appreciation for the craftsmanship in your products and i'm proud to carry and use them. your knives appear to have the fit of a fine watch yet they are rugged for everyday use. one of my favorites is the 770 line and while i don't think they are made any more it sure is a nice size, has a great look and feel and i love the axis lock. a great tool. -ed r. key words: product (general) i just received my 551s griptilian knife and your online catalog and delivery service has been excellent. in an age when just about everything seems to be manufactured overseas and product ordering limitations revolving around large company warehousing policies can be maddening, i must compliment your company and staff. i discovered your knife products about three months ago at the rei store in seattle, wa and was immediately hooked. unfortunately the knife model i wanted was out of stock and after many trips back to the store and several conversations later has lead me to believe they were no longer going to stock your products. what a shame! well, i'm not going to give up that easy... so after a quick search through google i found your web site and a very nicely done site it is i might add. first, i requested a catalog and that arrived in no time flat. then i finally ordered the knife i wanted and it arrived on time. the packaging was excellent, there was no damage and lastly there were no mistakes in my order. you now have another devoted customer and i intend to brag about your products and service whenever i get the chance. -greg c. key words: product (general) i have a 3100 benchmite auto; it is in a word superb. -bill m. key words: product (general) i am writing simply to let you know that this month makes one year that i have owned and used my benchmade osborne 940. some people do not get emotional about their pocket knives but i am not one of those people. this knife is utterly dependable, functional, beautiful, balanced, versatile, and razorâsharp. it is perfect in almost every way. i take pride in the quality of this knife and plan to own similar models in the very near future. i had quite a knife collection and was having a good time trying out many different knives, but benchmade has halted my pattern of buying a knife and replacing it before it was dull. please continue the 940 series of knives! and thank you for quality american made products. -jeffery c. key words: product (general) you make the most incredible knives that i have ever seen and had the pleasure of handling. that said i'm in the market for a new knife. -michael c. key words: product (general) i have both the mini and full size ambush and feel that they are the best value of any of your knives. i looked a long time to find a knife that i could go left side or right and had a grip and blade shape i was comfortable with. these knifes have everything i can ask for. thanks for a good product. -jim s. key words: product (general) i have just finished my first week of using my new prestigedges set of kitchen knives. i am thoroughly delighted. the superb design, manufacture, materials, fit, and finish of this knife set make them a joy to use. i have had had other sets of chef's knives; the benchmade set is without a doubt the finest. -pat o. key words: product (general) i bought the kitchen knife set from a local dealer near me and i am truly pleased with my purchase. i own several benchmade pocket knives and when i saw the kitchen knife set, i knew that these would be at the same high quality that i'm used to. i was not wrong in my thinking. i have a question about this set. with a knife set this nice, and a great presentation box to go with it, do you have a wood block holder to go on the counter too? if there is such a product that you make, i would truly be interested. -brian w. key words: product (general) about 18 months ago, i was given a benchmade knife as a gift. i believe it is a 905 mini stryker auto. i carried the knife for about several months and was well pleased. i realized that the pocket clip may have been stretched and was not as tight as original. i intended on getting it replaced, but unfortunately, it slipped out of my waistband during a deer hunt last december. as luck would have it, i found the knife this last weekend. it was in a cow pasture, close to a gate. it was in a sometimes-muddy area with salt lick blocks all around. this of course makes for salty mud, which can't be good on a knife. it had been walked on by cows, driven over by vehicles and generally abused for the last ten months. it was so crudded up i almost didn't recognize it as a knife. when i chipped it out of the dry mud i thought it was ruined for sure. it appeared to be corroded shut. i soaked it in water for a few hours. i then had to use a punch to depress the release button and had to use a screwdriver to pry the blade open. it was very stiff, but when forced, it did lock open. the blade looked corroded and had a few rust spots. after about an hour of cleaning, crud scraping and rinsing, the blade began to move more freely. i then let it soak in water overnight. after some more cleaning the next day, and a liberal application of wd40, the blade opened and closed more smoothly. the auto release began to function although a little rough. the blade was still sharp. i have since polished the blade with flitz, and with the exception of a couple of rust spots that i couldn't get out, it now looks and works great. i cannot tell you how impressed i am with the quality and overall integrity of benchmade knives. i cannot imagine a knife getting much more abuse, and with a little cleaning, it is back on the job without missing a beat. thanks for a great product. it won't be my last benchmade! -michael w. key words: product (general) i just received my brand new model 670 yesterday and i love it! -mark s. key words: product (general) i have about 70 knives in my collection from a variety of reputable manufacturers. my knives of choice are my model 914 rescue stryker which i carry in a sheath on my belt and my model 721 axis clipped in my back pocket. they have been put through hell and never let me down. -alan s. key words: product (general) having owned one benchmade knife, the (model 690) i wanted another model like it. my intention was only to buy the 730 ares axis. however, after trying out the axis locking system, i also bought mel pardue's 556od mini-griptilian. in a word, fantastic. i own about 60 folding knives from various makers, but along with benchmade's great style and feel the axis lock is really worth a bit extra cost. -jeff k. key words: product (general) i want to thank you again for your handiworks, which have once more proved themselves in the field -- this time at a call to rescue three gopher snakes caught in vegetable netting on a property in los altos hills, ca. as the photos illustrate, the model 5 rescue hook is inarguably the best tool for the job in a close-quarters' workspace where the objective is to free entangled animals while at the same time minimizing the risk of injury to them from the point of a sharp edge. what else is there to say but thank you from the officers of animal control, and thanks from the animals you have helped rescue. good going benchmade! -william w. key words: product (general) i purchased your 10300 monocrome just less than two weeks ago. i must say that i am appalled.... that other companies cannot put together a knife of this quality. it has been in my back pocket since i left the store with it. it has made an outstanding work knife, slim, light but with some heft to it (does that make sense?), comfortable, an edge that won't quit and absolutely the slickest action out of the box i have seen. that last point is very important to me. working in the telecomunications cabling industry there are several instances a day when i need my knife. usually it's a situation where i need it "right now!" and i have my hands full already. so having a knife that opens one-handed very easily and quickly is of utmost importance. most knives come out of the box with microscopic surface burrs on the bearing surfaces that take a while to break in before they become really slick. i have come to expect this. so you can imagine my surprise when i pulled this one out of the box and it flicked open like a spring-assist. that shows a fine attention to fit and finish that make the price more than worth it. and makes your company stand out like a beacon. you have my eternal gratitude, as well as my business. -martin s. key words: product (general) i have recently purchased one of your knives, a model 730 ares. it pleases me when in today's world i can purchase something and it surpasses my most critical expectations! i am a dedicated professional who specializes in the manufacture of precision aerospace components. i have also spent time in the automotive industry as a quality engineer for a very reputable company. having said this, i just want you all to realize that you and your dedicated employees have managed to surpass my highest level of expectations with the quality of your product design and its manufacture! in today's quickly changing market, with many companies sourcing commodities to asia, it is refreshing to see that north american companies such as benchmade can still demonstrate that we can indeed make superior products on the continent. please convey my most sincere thanks and gratitude to all employees, management and executive staff involved in the superior design and manufacture of these great products. please keep up the good work! -dr. charles e. b. key words: product (general) i can't say i usually take the time to write a company unless i really like the product and i really like my benchmade model 940 blue limited edition 37/50. i came to own this knife after a long search to replace a lost pocket knife. i don't make much money as an artist and college student so i have to buy my tools very carefully. i looked at literally hundreds of knives from low cost imports to customs. the look of the 940 caught my eye and i am so glad i gave it a try. i knew as i laid out my hard earned dollars for this knife it would be with me for a long time. i use it everyday dozens of times for cutting canvas for paintings, making lunch, cleaning fingernails, opening mail...etc etc. it is the best knife i have ever owned, the action is so smooth and the knife is a work of art, i have spent hours looking at it and marveling at the quality involved in its construction. aside from some cosmetic wear to the black finish on the blade it performs as new. i keep it sharp and clean and it rewards me as a fine tool should with a job well done. anyway i just wanted to thank you for making such a wonderful product which was worth every hard earned dollar i paid for it. i hope to set aside some money to buy another benchmade knife, a larger one, such as the new skirmish. although they all look great. -seth t. key words: product (general) i bought my first benchmade knife many years ago. it was an emerson 970st. i loved the look and feel of the knife, not to mention the fact that the liner lock was titanium. i carried that knife all day every day and used it for everything. it must have been my constant companion for something like ten years. finally, one day, the screws on the pocket clip broke when it caught on a steel park bench as i stood up. i could not get the broken screws out, nor could i find anyone who carried or could order replacement screws. i did not put too much effort into fixing it, though. i had a convenient excuse to buy a new knife. i tried several other brands to see how they held up in comparison. i liked some other brand knives, but i was not going to be satisfied until i had another benchmade in my pocket. i finally found what i was looking for in the 750 pinnacle. solid slab titanium handles with a built-in liner lock holding an ats-34 blade seemed just the ticket for me. i bought one about four years ago and it has been in my pocket ever since. i have used this knife hard. all the wear that it shows is a little chip in the blade edge where i used it to quarter a deer in a race against a fellow with a (non benchmade). we used the knives for work that should have been saved for hatchets and saws. his did well, but mine did, too. and mine was a folder! i have bought several others since then and have been pleased with every one. i love my benchmade knives, and many more of your knives are riding in other pockets because of my recommendation. everyone who knows me knows that i use knives hard, so if i like it, they can't go wrong. thank you for making a quality product that i know my life can depend on. -jim a. key words: product (general) i just wanted to let you know that i received my ares 735s and am very impressed with the quality of the knife. i will surely buy benchmade products in the future and will be a benchmade customer for life. thank you for your attentiveness and willingness to help me with my order. i am very happy that i had your assistance in the ordering process. -steven s. key words: product (general) ( out of 30 pocket knives i have collected and used for the last 32 years ) my griptilian is the best knife i have ever owned. every time i show the knife to someone they are always impressed by the way it opens and locks. i am looking forward to my next benchmade purchase i think the model 770 is just what i need.... wow what a cool knife that is.. if i win the lottery i am getting the 180dm ( very nice ) eventually i will have one of each.... thank you for making such great knives -patrick s. key words: product (emt/fire/rescue) once again your service department has outdone itself. i have used this knife from ground zero to hurricane katrina. i send it in for a tuneâup and sharpening, after hard use and it comes back refurbished. i do not have amazing stories, just a knife that always rises to the occasion when needed. i don't know how i have kept from losing it (knock on wood). i usually clip it to my pocket and transfer it to a cargo pocket when working on water. i have referred numerous people and will always have a benchmade knife (i will keep an eye out for a multiâtool). -tony z. key words: product (emt/fire/rescue) i want to thank you again for your handiworks, which have once more proved themselves in the field -- this time at a call to rescue three gopher snakes caught in vegetable netting on a property in los altos hills, ca. as the photos illustrate, the model 5 rescue hook is inarguably the best tool for the job in a closeâquarters' workspace where the objective is to free entangled animals while at the same time minimizing the risk of injury to them from the point of a sharp edge. what else is there to say but thank you from the officers of animal control, and thanks from the animals you have helped rescue. good going benchmade! -william w. key words: product (emt/fire/rescue) i am emailing regarding a knife that was given to me by one of your reps at the ducks unlimited great outdoors show in oshkosh wi, a few months back. i was drooling over your new ems-seatbelt-cutting-oxygen-tank-opening tool, and he volunteered to let me 'test it out', as i was an emt, and in paramedic training. i accepted, with the promise that i would email benchmade a brief report about how it has worked. well, here it is! the knife has worked hard and well!! i have worn in the hard case around my neck nearly constantly, and it has come in very handy. it has traveled all over the us, worked as an emt tool in wintry wisconsin, run as a paramedic in sultry texas, and toiled all over louisiana after katrina. in fact, it traveled over 2000 miles with me during one long 24-hr period on following the hurricane as we covered 911 zones for harried ems personnel, then ran in and out of new orleans for another 72-hours straight as we transported patients out of the airport to hospitals hours away in other parts of louisiana. it has bounced, jostled, cut, sliced, twisted, turned, and worked hard for months... and it has proven a durable, sharp and wellâmade knife... everything that benchmade claims. -bryan w. key words: product (emt/fire/rescue) i wanted to let you know how useful one of your products has been. i am a paramedic, and after years of hating our cheap trauma shears i have found a quality product. the shears are great and will cut through anything; the problem is they just don't last!! after cutting a couple of tee shirts and a pair of jeans the shears are dull. a firefighter friend showed me his rescue hook and raved about how well it cut so i risked my twenty bucks and bought one with a soft case...i figured that since it was a benchmade it was probably a safe bet. this has been hands-down the best work related purchase i have ever made. i have cut everything from tee shirts to denim jackets to heavy leather motorcycle pants without problems. like a hot knife through butter! every single time i use it, one of my fellow firefighters or medics is amazed by how well it works and several have gone on and bought one. i am thinking about buying four or five of them to sell to my coworkers. anyway, thanks again for selling such a quality product. -geoff m. key words: lifesharp service i just received my benchmade 960-400 i had sent in for the lifesharp service. it was brand new and i sent it in because it wasn't particularly sharp and to make sure that everything was in order with. i writing to compliment your staff and thank them for an excellent job and fantastic service. not only was i not charged for shipping, the service was expedited because it was a new knife. i'm glad to see that at least one company still treats it's customers with respect. -kimon a. key words: lifesharp service just received my griptilian back from "life sharp", and wanted to thank you for a great job and quick turn around time. cleaned, oiled and sharpened better than new. -frank m. key words: lifesharp service i just received my knife from sending it to your lifesharp service for the first time. it's an outstanding courtesy you give your customers. thank you and i look forward to having my knives serviced again in the future. -toan n. key words: customer service i just wanted to thank you for your prompt response to my questions. your products have always been exceptional and i will continue to both purchase and recommend benchmade. -louis b. key words: customer service thanks for the quick reply. i own several benchmade knives and the level of workmanship and performance is outstanding!
