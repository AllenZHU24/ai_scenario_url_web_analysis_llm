still important to use proper care and maintenance to ensure optimum performance levels. always keep your knife blade sharp. a dull knife requires additional force to use and is potentially more dangerous to use than a sharp one. there are a variety of products available when it comes to sharpening your knife. benchmade also offers a lifesharpsm service to its customers, which is a nice convenience. as for which one is best, it pretty much comes down to choosing the one you're most comfortable with using. never sharpen your knife on a power-grinding wheel as this can burn the temper out of the blade and weaken its integrity. always keep the locking areas of your knife clean- accumulation of dirt or debris could adversely affect the locking mechanism creating a potential safety hazard. to clean these areas we recommend using compressed air and lubricating with the specialty lubricant, bluelube. most of our blade steels have a very high carbon content which enables them to hold a superior cutting edge. unfortunately, carbon is also the element that causes rust so, preventive care is required if the knife is used in humid or marine environments. to aid in the cleaning of rust on the blades, we recommend using a fine grade, semi-chrome polish. a product such as marine tuf-cloth™ works well to not only wipe down the blade for cleaning but, also adds an invisible coating for added corrosion protection without leaving any oily film which may attract dirt and debris. lightly lubricate the pivot of the blade periodically to keep it operating smoothly. never attempt to use your knife as a screwdriver, pry-bar, chisel, or punch. never throw your knife. it was not designed for those purposes. use for any purpose other than cutting is considered abuse and is not covered under the benchmade warranty. do not disassemble your benchmade knife. disassembly by anyone other than the benchmade knife company, inc. warranty/repair department will void the warranty! minimum charge to reassemble your knife is $20.00 plus parts. most of all please enjoy your new knife and always remember to use it in a safe, responsible manner. thank you for choosing benchmade.
