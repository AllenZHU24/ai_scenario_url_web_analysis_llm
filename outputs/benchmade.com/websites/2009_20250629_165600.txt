i don't agree with benchmade's automatic knife policy and repair policy.a. benchmade knife company, inc. follows guidelines outlined in the federal codes, which prohibit us to ship automatic knife(s) to anyone other than public safety. to qualify, you have the option of registering with this website as the "public safety" web account type, and upload a copy of your photo id by navigating to "my account > public safety information > submit my id" (approval generally takes 24 to 72 business hours). additionally, you have the options to provide proof of your status by fax, mail, or scanned email attachment. we do not make any exceptions to this law, which is not applicable to oregon residents at this time. prices q. what is my cost on this model?

"bk" (or the older "bt") stands for our exclusive bk1 benchkote black coating on the blade for increased corrosion protection. and, the two together in "sbk" (or the older "sbt") stands for a partially serrated blade with bk1 coating. as for the "hs" and the "hssr", they designate m2 high-speed steel blades with the first being plain edge and the latter being comboedge. other letters you might see are bp, which stand for black-pearl, a ceramic style coating, and bx or sbx, which stand for either a plain edge black oxide coating or comboedge® black oxide coating. q. how do i know which knife is right for me?a. knives are tools. so it only makes sense that if you are considering the purchase of a knife, you should first consider how you would use it. are you going to cut, slice, shave, poke, pick, pierce, or just how will you be using the blade the largest percentage of time. the various blade styles offer their own specific application strengths and advantages just by their individual shape alone. with a little thought you can determine this by looking at each one and visualizing how it could be used. knife size comes down to personal comfort level and how much blade you need to accomplish your tasks. size can also play a factor in whether you choose a fixed blade or folder, as does the preferred method of carry. beyond that, consider what type of locking mechanism or blade accessing system works best for you. there are a variety of types available, so take some time to review several especially if you are new to knives. ideally it is best if you can open and close the knife with a single hand and if it can be done ambidextrous that's even better. lastly, look at the quality of the knife. is it something that will hold up to your expectations? do the blade and the handle work together as one, without excessive "play" in the open position? does the locking mechanism, lock the blade reliably? what is the knife made of; will it hold up to years of dependable use? in short, these are things to consider when you are trying to figure out what knife will do best for you. find a knowledgeable dealer or person who can give you some personal experiences on what works for them as well as show the various knives available. q. how do i sharpen my knife?a. it's inevitable. use your knife enough and it eventually gets to the point of needing some sharpening which is why it's a good idea to make a habit of touching up the edge to keep it sharp. it is much easier to maintain a sharp edge rather than to have to rebuild or re-edge a blade, which has become too dull. now that having been said, you have several options available for sharpening. first off, there are numerous sharpening products on the market today. each is probably more than capable of putting an edge on a knife given the proper use of the product. so if you choose a do-it-yourself method, choose one that you are most confident with using. the key here is to maintain the edge angles on the blade edge. a second option may be the dealer from which you purchased the knife. chances are they either offer a sharpening service to their customers or they know of a reputable service in the area. another option is to use our lifesharp service. this is a great way to not only get your knife sharpened, but also to have our technicians "tune-up" your knife by cleaning, oiling and refreshing it to optimum form. check it out. if none of these seem to appeal to your needs, you can log into the benchmade forum and post the question to other benchmade users. this is a great resource for direct information from people who use the products everyday. q. my knife is getting rusty spots. how do i fix them?a. unfortunately some people are misleading by the term "stainless steel". even though 154cm is classified as stainless steel, it is still susceptible to corrosion if you are not practicing proper knife care. even the bk1 coated blades will rust along the sharpened edge if not cared for. to aid in the cleaning of rust on the blades we use a fine grade, semi-chrome polishing compound. follow the instructions on the product and it should work just fine. beyond that you should apply a corrosion inhibitor to the blade to prevent future corrosion from occurring. a product such as tuf-cloth or militec-1® can be used to wipe down the blade for corrosion protection. q. i can't find torx drivers to use to remove my carry-clip or adjust my knife. who has them?a. we do, or your benchmade dealer does. we offer the bluebox® , which is a self-contained driver and 6 lobe bit set in a compact box set. it contains all the bit sizes to match the various screw sizes used on our knives (most common are sizes 6, 8, and 10). otherwise, you can go to a nearby sears store (micro tools section), or a tool supply house and you're sure to find what you need. quality hardware or /images/home improvement stores should stock them as well but in most cases the bits don't run small enough. q. how many of each of the discontinued models were made, when were they made and what is the collectable price now as compared to the price of the knife at the time it was produced?a. at this time, please contact us. please note: we cannot give collectible values or related information because benchmade doesn't determine this. this is more set by the demand in the "knife user world" and this changes all the time. q. why do i see "displaying: 0-0 of 0 results" when i do a search?a. if you have trouble finding a product that you feel is listed on the website, then you can try typing part of the name (ex., "bal" for bali-song). another search alternative is to use the choice "all" and click the "search" button to list all product. feel free to find the product you are looking for under the categories at the "products" menu. new product and information will be posted as it becomes available. when using the knife wizard you may get this result if there are no products currently listed on this website with the criteria you selected. can't find an answer to your question?
