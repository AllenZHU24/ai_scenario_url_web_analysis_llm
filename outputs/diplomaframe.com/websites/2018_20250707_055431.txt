key tips for custom diploma frame selectionyour diploma should never be dry mounted, spray mounted, or otherwise permanently adhered to a board for framing.as with any important document, it should be hung within a mat opening, either from the top with archival tape or hinged to a conservation-quality backing board using archival mounting corners. it is best for the document to have room to expand and contract with changing temperatures, and even a slight “wobble” in the document is preferable to permanently and irreversibly pressing it flat.your diploma should be custom-framed using a high-quality mat that both showcases the document and keeps it away from the glass.you’ll want to ensure that the matting and backing materials are not just buffered to be acid-free but are designed for conservation-quality document preservation. this will be indicated in the documentation for the frame or on the mat board samples and specification sheets. depending on the size of your document, the mat should typically be 2.25” to 3” wide.you’ll want to choose an attractive frame that coordinates with your home or office environment. why not splurge for something you really love, since you’ll be looking at your diploma for many years to come?
