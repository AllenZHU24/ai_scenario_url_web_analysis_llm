'actual document size' is the overall physical size of your document, while 'printed area size' is where the printed text or image begins to where it ends. to get the printed size area, you must measure from the top of the highest lettering to the bottom of the lowest image (usually the seal or signature) and the same applies to the lettering from left to right. this ensures a perfect fit for your document.6. how long does it take to get my frame?because our frames are custom-made, our standard production time is approximately 5-9 business days plus fedex ground transit time from our facility. you should receive your order in approximately 10 - 15 business days. if you need your order sooner, we offer accelerated shipping options. our online checkout system will allow you to specify an in-hand date for your order along with a rate to guarantee delivery by that date.need more information? contact our customer service department at 800-477-9005 or info@diplomaframe.zendesk.com.7. can i expedite an order for earlier delivery?yes, if you need your order sooner, we offer accelerated shipping options. during your online checkout, you will have the option to select from various shipping choices, which can include 2-day, 3-day, and even overnight delivery—options may vary based on location. an email will be sent from info@diplomaframe.com with the tracking number once the order ships out. have questions? please reach out to our customer service team promptly at (800) 477-9005 (monday through friday, between 8:30 am and 5:00 pm est) or send an email to info@diplomaframe.zendesk.com.8. is there a promo code that i can use?please enjoy $5 off your custom frame purchase of $99+ with code ny2ny. minimum purchase excludes shipping and tax and offer is redeemable through 12/31/28 11:59 pm et. offer not applicable on previous orders, gift cards or in combination with other offers. select a topic still no luck? contact us here! footer subscribe & get 15% off sign up for our newsletter and receive monthly updates on our biggest sales and new products. get 15% off your first order as a reward. submit & get 15% off successfully signed up to our email list! shop frames diploma frames certificate frames double document frames state bar frames custom frames varsity letter frames class photo frames autograph frames photo frames special occasion frames gift cards best sellers shop by your college or university high school or prep school professional association profession logo state seal military branch honor society fraternity or sorority graduation gifts about our frames mouldings mat options glass options museum-quality protection level-lock	® hanging system frame styles commitment & guarantee sustainability our company about us careers press affiliations & memberships blog accessibility statement corporate responsibility policy green practices frame my future scholarships collaborate with us our services become a partner corporate framing custom business framing bulk picture framing support contact us sign in | my account order tracking shipping return policy framing instructions faqs gift card balance gift card combine myframes buyer portal contact us email live chat 800-477-9005mon - fri 8:30am - 5pm est help center privacy | terms & conditions | site map © 2025 church hill classics - v14.0.2 find your school search you’ll love the frame you purchase from us — we guarantee it! 120-day return policy. can't find your school?
