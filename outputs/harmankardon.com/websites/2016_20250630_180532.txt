and it makes me happy. everyone else is impressed too! - hughes it! #hughesorlose date published: 2016-12-15 rated 5 out of 5 by mattk97 from worth it. hello, by starting out i'll give a brief history of my experience with bluetooth speakers, and trust me i've had a lot of them. first and foremost i am rebuilding my "productivity set up," and i wanted some decent looking speakers that i could use on the desk with bluetooth capability that way i could also use them with my phone or other bluetooth enabled devices without unplugging a 3.5 jack and moving it on a constant. (with bluetooth) i currently have an iphone 6s+ and i use spotify on a premium with the "highest playback quality" available (from spotify application). i get about 30, 40 feet on bluetooth with the device that i currently have. however the sound does cut out when going through multiple walls it would appear. (with auxiliary) the sound is spectacular, probably not anywhere near audiophile level however if my macbook that i have used it with had a external dac it would more than likely sound even better than it already does. (loud-ness??) i personally have messed with the onyx studio 3, the really big one and they sound just as loud to me, even with just one the clarity at the loud volume is wonderful. the bass does not sound muddy when on a low volume nor a high volume. it's very crisp. (battery life) i have used them probably off and on for about a week now and not had to charge them since. so i'd say the battery life would obviously very depending on how you're using them (bluetooth, volume, etc) however i have not had any issues on random use with the battery life. date published: 2016-11-18 onyx mini reviews - page 2 y_2017, m_1, d_16, h_22 bvseo_bulk, prod_bvrr, vn_bulk_0.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_6 loc_en_us, sid_onyxmini, prod, sort_[sortentry(order=rating, direction=descending), sortentry(order=age, direction=descending), sortentry(order=rating, direction=ascending), sortentry(order=age, direction=descending), sortentry(order=age, direction=descending)] clientname_harmankardon will the amazon echo dot2 utilizing blue tooth play through the onyx mini? asked by: henry i paired my echo dot with 2 onyx minis in my home office yesterday.  phenomenal sound.  works great and seamlessly. answered by: techie date published: 2017-01-17 i cannot get to see this speaker on current devices with bluetooth ver. 6 nor ver. 7. - is there anyway to update the speaker's bluetooth software version? asked by: mrjaunty if you are pertaining to the android version of a device since bluetooth version to date is only up to version 5, there should not be any issues pairing it with the onyx mini. to place the onyx mini in pairing mode, press the bluetooth button, an audible tone and a flashing led will indicate that the onyx mini is now in pairing mode. check your phone/tablet’s bluetooth settings, turn it on, and should show the speaker. connect and enjoy your music. answered by: joe g at customer service date published: 2017-01-03 how to pair/connect with two onyx mini to bluetooth asked by: hernando follow these steps in initiating the wireless dual sound feature: 1. pair your device(i.e phone, laptop, etc...) to one of the onyx mini's that you have. 2. once the device is paired, switch the other onyx mini on. 3. press and hold the bluetooth button on the onyx mini that is paired with your device for at least 7-10 seconds or until you see the bluetooth button blink initiating wireless dual pairing mode. 4. go to the other onyx mini and perform step 3. 5. you will hear a notification sound if both speakers have been paired together. answered by: ren at customer service date published: 2017-01-02 can the mini speaker connect to my laptop ? asked by: angel0415 yes. the onyx mini can be connected to a source device in two ways; via bluetooth or auxiliary/wired connection. if your laptop is bluetooth compatible, you can simply pair the onyx mini with your laptop through it's bluetooth settings. if not, you can use an audio cable from your laptop's headphone jack to the onyx mini's auxiliary in. answered by: ren at customer service date published: 2016-12-31 can you prevent this unit from shutting off when plugged in and not in use? can my phone pair back to the unit without touching the power button? asked by: hello unfortunately, it is not possible to prevent onyx mini from shutting off when plugged in and not in use, as it has power save feature that automatically shuts the unit down if no audio is detected and you would need to press its power button to go on operational mode. answered by: ren at customer service date published: 2016-12-30 onyx mini questions - page 2 2017-01-18t10:51cst bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_24 loc_en_us, sid_onyxmini, prd, sort_recentanswersfirst clientname_harmankardon online retailers in store locator no online dealer's available for this product find a store near you the store locator is designed to help you find the closest store near you. zip code radius 15 miles 30 miles 100 miles 300 miles search click a store in the list or on the map to view details. sharing sign up and get the best deals go support shipping policy return & exchanges faqs product support software downloads parts order status country selector about us harman corporate careers privacy policy terms of sale terms of use why buy direct site index satisfaction guaranteed not completely satisfied with your purchase? you may return it within 30 days from the date of purchase. return policy. contact us (800) 422-8027 mon - fri: 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m. (et) sat - sun: 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (et) contact us account sign in sign up order status follow us for exclusive offers and content! close x our brands © 2017 harman international industries, incorporated. all rights reserved. more about cookies hide i agree more about cookies close are you sure you want to return to your shopping cart? stay in checkout return to cart
