we use the latest encryption technology (secure sockets layer, or ssl) to secure your personal information. the information you provide when you place an order is encrypted (or coded) using a secure server for maximum security. this coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your information as it moves through our ordering system. certain browsers will not allow communication through secure servers. if this is the case, you won't be able to place an order online. if you have any problems placing an order online please print your shopping page and place your order by phone at (877) 871-6755. please note that calls to (877) 871-6755 that are not made from a us landline may be subject to a charge. to check the security of your computer, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window if you are using netscape, or the lower right-hand corner of your browser window if you are using internet explorer. if you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the encryption technology is active and the server is secure. you can also check by looking at the url line of your browser; when you access a secure server, the initial characters of the site address will be "https." what if you link to another site?
