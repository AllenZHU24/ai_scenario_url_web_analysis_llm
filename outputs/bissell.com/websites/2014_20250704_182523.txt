in the early 2000s, we discovered that all of us here at bissell share a love for pets (72% of us are pet owners!). but for all the amazing things we love about our four-legged friends, they’re not so mindful of a tidy home. when we found out this was a deterrent to many would-be pet adopters, we knew we had to do something. in 2001, we began adoption efforts in partnership with petfinder.com, and in 2005, we launched the spotbot® portable deep cleaner, our first product designed specifically for cleaning up after pets. under the leadership of cathy bissell (parent to three black labs), we continued to support the pet community through contributions to u.s. pet charities. and, in 2011, she founded the bissell pet foundation, a non-profit organization that advocates for lost, abused, neglected and abandoned pets by raising funds through the sale of bissell pet products. since its inception, the bissell pet foundation has been able to award more than $500,000 to over 375 organizations in 43 states. our goal is to raise $250,000 annually through pet product sales to support the life-saving work of the foundation. we are deeply committed to helping pets find homes and to showing bissell customers that, with the right cleaning tools, pet ownership can be full of joy and companionship, rather than fur balls and “surprises”. now home to a deeper cleanto this very day, bissell is still family-owned and passionate about helping you effectively and easily clean your home so you can put down the vacuum, enjoy life and come home to a deeper clean. all in all, whether your messes are baby food or red wine, mud or chocolate, cat hair or pet accident, we’re here to help you embrace those messes, erase them in a jiffy, and get on with the most meaningful aspect of your home—living in it. located on the white label above, usually on the back of the machine. close sign up for bissell emails!
