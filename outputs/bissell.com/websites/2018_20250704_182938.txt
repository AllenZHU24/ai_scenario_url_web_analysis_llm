before putting it away, fill the solution and water tanks with hot water, set the dial to high traffic and run the machine to flush internal lines. you can also flush the lines by using bissell’s hydrorinsetm self-cleaning hose tool, it cleans the hose by rinsing out unwanted dirt, pet hair and lingering odors. we also have maintenance and care videos for carpet cleaners here. back to top portable carpet cleaner tips did you know you can keep formula from hardening in your portable carpet cleaner’s hose? before putting it away suction hot tap water through the hose to clean it out, then empty the dirty water tank. you can also clean out the hose by getting our hydrorinsetm self-cleaning hose tool, it helps clean the hose by rinsing out unwanted dirt, pet hair and lingering odor. no matter how you clean the lines, it’s also a good idea to rinse all tanks and tools and let them air dry after each use. back to top vacuum tips did you know you can extend the life of your machine’s belt? just cut off hair and other debris that gets wrapped around your vacuum’s brush roll on a regular basis to keep the brush from seizing and reduce the risk of the belt breaking. if your home has a lot of pet hair to clean, you may want to consider one of our products with a tangle-free brush roll like the pet hair eraser® upright vacuum. the brush roll’s unique bristle design reduces the amount of hair that would normally get wrapped around it. did you know you can unclog your vacuum if you lose suction? try removing clogs in the upper or lower hoses with a broomstick. simply put the end of the stick through the hose and push it through to get rid of any obstruction. did you know you need to change your vacuum’s filters regularly? many machines have more than one filter that needs to be cleaned and/or replaced every once and awhile to keep things running smooth. check your vacuum’s user guide for more information on your specific model. you can also visit our parts & supplies page to buy new filters. back to top steam mop tips did you know you can help your steam mop filter last longer? just empty the water out of the tank after each use. doing so will prevent leaking and extend the life of your filter. bissell steam products use just tap or distilled water for a chemical-free clean. however, if you’re looking for a refreshing scent, try our eucalyptus mint scented demineralized water. back to top hard floor cleaner tips did you know you can help prevent problems with your hard floor cleaner’s sprayer? make sure you wash the cap and insert on the clean water tank with warm water and use a soft-bristled brush to remove buildup and help keep your sprayer in good working condition. back to top sweeper tips did you know static buildup can cause your sweeper to stop picking up debris? use your laundry dryer to warm up an anti-static dryer sheet for 5 minutes. then wipe your sweeper’s brushes with it to prevent static buildup from happening. back to top mop and duster tips did you know the way you wash your microfiber pads can help them stay effective longer? for best results, hand or machine wash them with detergent and no fabric softener. hang dry or briefly machine dry on low-medium heat. back to top home to a deeper clean® about us our history sustainability & csr community involvement careers newsroom products carpet cleaners vacuums steam and hard floor cleaners sweepers carpet and floor cleaning formulas febreze freshness pet accessories mops brooms and air quality cleaning needs pet clean-up deep down clean auto and garage cordless multi surface lightweight quick & easy small living spaces allergen control eco-friendly 2-in-1 helpful resources videos faqs blog stain removal guide cleaning 101s maintenance tips sds and ingredients rewards specials email sign-up learn more site map feedback © 2004-2018 bissell, all rights reserved. privacy policy | terms of use | california supply chains act life inspired cleaning innovations™ homecare: cleaning formulas: deep cleaner rental: pet products and rental: commercial line: bissell pet foundation: pet care products: show fewer features show more features expand close show all specs hide all specs expand close
