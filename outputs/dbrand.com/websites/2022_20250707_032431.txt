every single teardown skin is guaranteed to be a 99% accurate representation of your device's internals. as for that other 1%... how good are you at where's waldo? the print ink costs a lot of money. know what costs even more money? a $92,000 printer. for every skin you don't buy, 0.021% of the printer goes unpaid for. also, zack is gonna be pissed. have you seen that guy in real life? you might, if you don't buy a skin. on the other hand, if you do buy a skin, you'll see exactly why that printer is worth more than your college tuition. who are we kidding? you didn't go to college. the protection when you think of dbrand, you probably think of texture. realistic texture. well, trust us when we say you don't want your phone to feel like little legos, exposed wires, and circuit boards. we needed to find something else. we found two things else: teardown's original optically-clear finish, and our legendary ultramatte texture. pick one. make a choice skin ultimate scratch protection 0.23mm thin easy to apply buy case military-grade impact protection revolutionary grip tactile buttons buy close teardown teardown category skin case device appleframeworkgooglemicrosoftnintendooneplussamsungvalvenoneother manufacturer iphone 14 pro maxiphone 14 plusiphone 14 proiphone 14iphone 13 pro maxiphone 13 proiphone 13iphone 13 miniiphone 12 pro maxiphone 12 proiphone 12iphone 12 miniiphone 11 pro maxiphone 11 proiphone 11iphone se (2022, gen 3)iphone se (2020, gen 2)iphone xs maxiphone xsiphone xriphone xiphone 8iphone 7ipad pro 12.9" (2021, gen 5)ipad pro 12.9" (2020, gen 4)ipad pro 12.9" (2018-2019, gen 3)ipad pro 11" (2021, gen 3)ipad pro 11" (2020, gen 2)ipad pro 11" (2018-2019, gen 1)ipad 10.9" (2022, gen 10)ipad air 5ipad air 4ipad mini 6macbook air 13.6" (2022, m2)macbook air 13" (2020, m1)macbook air 13" (2020, intel)macbook air 13" (2018-2019)macbook pro 16" (2021)macbook pro 16" (2019)macbook pro 15" (2016-2019, touch bar)macbook pro 14" (2021)macbook pro 13" (2022, m2)macbook pro 13" (2020, m1)macbook pro 13" (2020, intel, two thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2020, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2019, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2019, two thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2016-2018, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2016-2018, two thunderbolt 3 ports)apple airtagframework laptoppixel 7 propixel 7pixel 6apixel 6 propixel 6pixel 5a 5gpixel 5pixel 4a (5g)pixel 4apixel 4 xlsurface duo 2nintendo switch olednintendo switchoneplus 10 prooneplus 9 prooneplus 9oneplus nordoneplus 8toneplus 8 prooneplus 8oneplus 7 progalaxy s22 ultragalaxy s22 plusgalaxy s22galaxy s21 ultragalaxy s21 plusgalaxy s21galaxy note 20 ultragalaxy note 20galaxy z fold 4galaxy z fold 3galaxy z fold 2galaxy z flip 4galaxy z flip 3galaxy s20 ultragalaxy s20 plusgalaxy s20galaxy note 10 plusgalaxy s10 plusgalaxy s10steam decknoneother device finish price -- teardown ultramatte teardown none warning included add-ons grip (magsafe compatible) like the name says, it's grippy and has magnets. it'll also protect your phone. buy it. price -- more info grip like the name says, it's grippy. it'll also protect your phone. buy it. price -- more info grip like the name says, it's grippy. it also includes a keyring. buy it. price -- more info tempered glass defend your screen from yourself. each kit contains two. buy a pair. price -- more info trackpad skin it's a teardown skin for your trackpad. if you want it, buy it. if you don't want it, seek professional help. price -- more info magsafe charger a teardown skin for your magsafe charger. that's double the magnets. price -- more info what's included: note: price -- add to cart ships tbd so you don't have a compatible device. you blew it. congrats. give us your email address and we'll notify you if we ever support your device. close frequently asked questions what is this? teardown. it's like having a transparent back for your phone, without the voided warranty. why is this? because glass is glass... and you definitely don't have the dexterity to complete your own transparent back mod. when is this? today. but also, forever. how is this? expensive scanners and printers, mostly. who is this? dbrand and zack "jerryrigeverything" nelson. also you, if you buy one. where is this? that's a stupid question. we'll pretend you asked a smart one. teardown comes in two finishes: original and ultramatte. original has an optically clear gloss finish that produces vibrant colors and flawless visibility on the teardown design. ultramatte mutes the optical clarity and features a premium fingerprint-resistant texture. you are herehometeardown
