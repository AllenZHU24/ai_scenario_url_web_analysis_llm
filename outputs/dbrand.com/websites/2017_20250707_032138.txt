simple: only dbrand uses authentic 3m vinyl across every single one of the google pixel xl skins you see available. in fact, not only do we use authentic 3m vinyl across every single pixel xl skin on our site, many of the 3m textures available here are exclusive to dbrand. how? again, quite simple: because we buy such a massive amount of vinyl from 3m, they’ve opened up an opportunity where we work together to create custom textures and patterns. our use of exclusive 3m vinyl on all our pixel xl skins means you’ll never end up with an inferior-grade material for your pixel xl phone wrap. our pixel xl phone skins stick perfectly to your device until the day you decide to remove it - and once you do, it's guaranteed to leave zero adhesive residue on your device. google pixel xl phone skins from dbrand: precision-fit, premium materials, and no adhesive goo upon removal. if you’re looking for the best pixel xl skin on the planet, you’ve come to the right place. unrivaled precision precision: it’s a word we take very seriously at dbrand. since our company was founded on 11-11-11 (yes, that's the actual date), we’ve been striving to one-up ourselves in the pursuit of flawless precision. take a look at the product photography – it can’t lie. our reputation for the most precisely-fitted google pixel xl skins on earth is no joke, and it’s only made possible through painstaking attention to detail and endless prototypes. the reality is that we create over a thousand prototypes for our pixel xl skins before achieving a fit which can be classified as flawless. our pixel xl skins are designed to add no bulk. in fact, at less than 1/4mm in thickness, our skins are thin enough to fit under any pixel xl case you can find. dbrand pixel xl skins add texture, scratch protection, and all the grip you’ve been looking for. it genuinely isn’t possible to find a higher quality pixel xl skin than the ones available at dbrand. the most precise fit on earth™: it’s trademarked with good reason. unlimited customization take a second to scroll up and check out our pixel xl skin customizer. we’ll wait here. back?
