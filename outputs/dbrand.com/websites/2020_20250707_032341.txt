every single teardown skin is guaranteed to be a 99% accurate representation of your device's internals. as for that other 1%... how good are you at where's waldo? the print ink costs a lot of money. know what costs even more money? a $92,000 printer. for every skin you don't buy, 0.021% of the printer goes unpaid for. also, zack is gonna be pissed. have you seen that guy in real life? you might, if you don't buy a skin. on the other hand, if you do buy a skin, you'll see exactly why that printer is worth more than your college tuition. who are we kidding? you didn't go to college. the protection when you think of dbrand, you probably think of texture. realistic texture. well, trust us when we say you don't want your phone to feel like little legos, exposed wires, and circuit boards. we needed to find something else. we found two things else: teardown's original optically-clear finish, and our legendary ultramatte texture. pick one. teardown let's get started. buy make a choice skin ultimate scratch protection 0.23mm thin easy to apply buy case military-grade impact protection revolutionary grip tactile buttons buy close teardown teardown category skin case device noneapplegooglenintendooneplusredmisamsungxiaomiother manufacturer noneiphone 12 pro maxiphone 12 proiphone 12iphone 12 miniapple magsafe chargeriphone 11 pro maxiphone 11 proiphone 11iphone se (2020, gen 2)iphone xs maxiphone xsiphone xriphone xiphone 8iphone 7ipad pro 12.9" (2020, gen 4)ipad pro 12.9" (2018-2019, gen 3)ipad pro 11" (2020, gen 2)ipad pro 11" (2018-2019, gen 1)macbook pro 16" (2019)macbook pro 15" (2016-2019, touch bar)macbook pro 13" (2020, intel, two thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2020, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2019, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2019, two thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2016-2018, four thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook pro 13" (2016-2018, two thunderbolt 3 ports)macbook air 13" (2020, intel)macbook air 13" (2018-2019)pixel 5pixel 4a (5g)pixel 4a (5g) uwpixel 4apixel 4 xlpixel 4pixel 3 xlpixel 3nintendo switchoneplus 8toneplus nordoneplus 8 prooneplus 8oneplus 7 prooneplus 7t prooneplus 7toneplus 6toneplus 6redmi k20 progalaxy note 20 ultragalaxy note 20galaxy z fold 2galaxy z flipgalaxy z flip 5ggalaxy s20 ultragalaxy s20 plusgalaxy s20galaxy note 10 plusgalaxy s10 plusgalaxy s10galaxy s10egalaxy note 9galaxy s9 plusgalaxy s9xiaomi mi 9t proxiaomi mi 9tother device finish none original ultramatte add-ons grip like the name says, it's grippy. it'll also protect your phone. buy it. price -- close grip™ case there are two components to the dbrand grip™: the phone case itself, and the skin you apply to the back. you shouldn't disable this unless you already own a grip™ case. don't say we didn't warn you. more info prism have you ever wanted to smash your phone with a hammer?
