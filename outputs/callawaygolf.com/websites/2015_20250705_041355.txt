on advice from an associate at golf galaxy i tried this ball last spring and never looked back. i'm a senior golfer and the length i gained with this ball was super. not only longer but straighter than the chrome ball i was playing. putting with this ball is just special. it comes off the putter very softly but with a good, true roll. i love this ball and hope that callaway never discontinues it. best ball i ever played and priced moderately. how good is that! october 26, 2014 excellent ball for seniors i am a low handicap senior, so losing some club head speed. this ball is giving me 15 to 20 yards more off the tee, 10-15 yards on irons. best of all, no shock to the system when you hit it slightly off center. very soft, but very long. great golf ball. october 9, 2014 love this ball! after having both of my shoulders operated on, i've been trying for a couple of years to modify my swing (limited to 3/4 backswing) and its also left me with a swing speed in the low 80's. i tried super soft balls on a friends recommendation and after playing my first round with them, this is absolutely the ball for me. i haven't enjoyed this much accuracy and distance since before i got my shoulders worked on. great off the tee and off the fairway and excellent touch with the putter. i was a little concerned about the durability of a ball this soft, but they held up as good as any other ball. throw in the price and this ball is unbeatable for me. i won't be buying anything else. well done callaway! december 22, 2014 super soft , super ball bought a dozen of these balls after a recommendation from the golf store. i am an 18 handicapper and hit fairly long off the tee for an old guy (250 yds) but i've always had trouble with slicing the ball. these balls explode off the tee with hardly any spin thus keeping it much straighter and travelling about 270 yds. i lost three balls on layup shots because i hadn't adjusted for the extra length they produce. great feel off the tee and on the green. looking forward to playing them again as i get used to the new length and the idea of most shots going more or less where they are aimed. october 4, 2014 wow - incredible! i got a dozen of these balls over the summer based on a friend's recommendation, but i waited until it got a little cooler to play the super softs, since i loved my speed regime 2s so much..... i know i am splitting hairs, but i should have been playing these balls all along. you can't go wrong with either of these balls. it was a brisk day, with a high around 50 degrees, and i have never hit the ball better! i bombed my drives and it checked up and held the greens very nicely too (i was playing a tough course with fast greens). also, i love putting with this ball - so soft and it rolled well. i really can't believe these balls are $19.99 per dozen - it's a flat out steal. november 10, 2014 does what it says on the box have played with this ball for the last 6 months and have been very pleased with it's performance until last week after 10 holes a deep cut appeared on my ball which was new it did not hit any objects ( trees etc.) photo enclosed. is this a one off or have you had any other customers with a similar complaint. in my opinion this ball is very good value. look forward to your response to this review take care billy wright january 10, 2015 playing golf for 50 years 11 handicap best overall ball i have evre played better distance flies straight t fantastic feel using 1/2 club less october 9, 2014 great all around ball. i got a couple of sleaves this summer cause the pro shop was out of hot pro`s. a great golf ball for year round play. just as far and just as much spin as the hot and hot pro`s. took a little getting used to off the putter face cause of the softness cause they go! a great all around golf ball! november 6, 2014 2015-12-29 t07:00:47.383-06:00 bvseo_lps, prod_bvrr, vn_prr_5.6 cp-1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_43, tr_43 loc_en_us, sid_balls-2015-supersoft, prod, sort_default 2 3 next>> your order status order number check status close password reset provide your email address below and we will send you a new password shortly. e-mail send password close sign up today!
