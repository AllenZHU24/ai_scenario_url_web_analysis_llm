codes.we do not accept competitor coupon codes or discounts.when purchasing single or multiple items, we will accept one coupon code or promotional discount per order.coupon codes cannot be used in conjunction with a promotional discount in the same order. when a coupon is entered, if that coupon has a greater value than the promotional discount, the promotional discount will be removed and the coupon will be applied. if the promotional discount has a greater value than the coupon, the coupon will not be applied.for example, a catchers set (chest protectors, leg guards, and catcher's helmet) for $250 is added to the shopping cart and a 10% discount ($25) is automatically shown in the cart for a total of $225. during checkout, a coupon code is applied for $20 off a $200 purchase. the $250 catchers set will not receive the $20 off for the coupon code since the promotional discount has a greater value. so, the total for this purchase will be $225.minimum advertised price (map)minimum advertised price (map) a map is an agreement between suppliers and retailers that specifies the lowest price at which an item is allowed to be advertised. if you've ever tried to shop around for an item and kept coming across the same price, you probably discovered that item's map.rawlings performance products fall into this category. as part of the map policy, these performance products also
