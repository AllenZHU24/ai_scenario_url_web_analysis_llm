at this point in time, baseball’s postseason awards focused almost entirely on offensive excellence. the following scrollable timeline captures rawlings’ product innovations that forever changed the game of baseball: 1877 first-ever fielder’s glove the original leather hand wrap model, popular until 1886 when the first gloves with fingers were introduced, could be worn on either hand 1899 regulation league catcher’s mask made of heavy black-enameled wire and padding faced with specially-tanned horsehide, this original catcher’s mask was “warranted first-class and reliable in every particular” 1901 newly designed catcher’s mask touted as “rust-proof, break-proof and injury-proof,” the redesigned construction consisted of heavy, hardened tinned wire frame and large, laced padding 1905 infielder-specific glove designed to increase durability and protection for infielders who handle the ball more frequently than other position players, these gloves added larger, heavier padding around the edges and on the wrist 1910 10-ounce fielder’s glove tested the 10-ounce fielder’s glove performance limit set in 1895;
