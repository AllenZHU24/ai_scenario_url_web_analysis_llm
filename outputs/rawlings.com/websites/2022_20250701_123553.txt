bats. this normally takes the form of a negative number; for example, we may offer certain bat models in â€śdropsâ€ť of -5 and -10, among other â€śdrops.â€ť typically, a lower drop will feel heavier than a higher drop of the same model and length, so a -5 bat will feel heavier than a -10 bat of the same length. drop is intended to give you a relative idea of how heavy or light a bat feels. but drop is not intended to and should not be relied upon to calculate the actual weight of a bat. many factors may affect the actual weight of a bat. further, as a result of differing certifying entities, requirements, standards, or procedures, bats with varying finished weights may be certified as a certain â€śdropâ€ť. and rawlingsâ€™ internal manufacturing tolerances, and finishing materials rawlings adds to the bat such as grip tape, paint, glue, stickers, and decals, may affect the weight of rawlings bats as they are sold to the consumer. these and other factors may mean that, by way of example only, a 30â€ť bat certified as a -10 drop may be more or less than 20 oz. if placed on a scale after purchase, and it may feel heavier or lighter when swung and may perform or sound differently than another 30â€ť -10 bat. ultimately, the best way to know whether you feel comfortable swinging a bat is to try it out first.how to submit a warranty claim for bats purchased outside the u.s:do not return the bat directly to rawlings! return the defective bat along with the proof of purchase to the sporting goods dealer from which it was purchased. if the dealer determines that the bat is eligible for warranty coverage, he or she should provide you with a replacement bat or order one from rawlings if the desired model or size is temporarily out of stock. if the dealer deems
