amount of the purchase. 4.exclusions.members earn program points only on the purchase price of qualifying products if they are logged onto the website. calculation of program points excludes payment by the member for shipping charges and all taxes, including without limitation, federal, state, and local taxes or use taxes. program points will not be earned on any discounts or other credits offered in connection with a product. for example, if a product that is normally $100 is on sale for $75, a member will only earn points on the purchase price of $75. purchases of gift cards, redemption of merchandise vouchers, and any type of price adjustments, including merchandise returns, are not eligible for points. all purchases made: (i) by a member prior to such member joining the

return, refund, returned check due to non-sufficient funds, or other credit will be deducted from the member's account in an amount equal to the points earned for the original transaction, including
