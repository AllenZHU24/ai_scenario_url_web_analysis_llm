we don’t recommend that you wear suede in wet weather. we would recommend using a good quality suede protector, especially on lighter coloured suedes, which will help if you get caught out in the rain. how to clean leather shoes we would suggest using a professional leather cleaning specialist who uses an environmentally friendly method to protect your footwear when needed. leathers can also be cleaned with a soft, dry cloth to remove any dirt, or with a small footwear brush. suede and nubuck can be cleaned gently with a suede brush. removing stubborn marks will require a suitable product available in good-quality shoe care stores. canvas can be cleaned with a damp soft cloth - never use the washing machine as it will damage the footwear and your machine. care must be taken when cleaning canvas uppers as finishings are applied. brighter colours may change if water and excessive rubbing is applied. how to protect leather footwear smooth leather footwear can be cleaned with a soft, dry cloth to remove any dirt. gently clean suede and nubuck footwear with a suede brush. removing stubborn marks will require any suitable shoe care product. polishes and creams may damage hand-finished leather and leather details. test in a discreet spot before applying to the whole shoe. if in doubt see your local cobbler or footwear specialist. liquid polish applicators on fine leather footwear is not recommended as it would destroy natural leathers. to protect textile uppers, they can be treated on a regular basis using a good quality shower guard spray. this helps create a barrier to make it slightly shower resistant and prevents excess dirt from sticking. it is advisable to use a shoe horn when putting on footwear to avoid damage to the heel area. before applying any polish or sprays: - remove the laces and undo any straps. place a correctly sized shoe tree into your shoes. - remove any dust and dirt with a small footwear brush how to store leather footwear store in a warm dry environment. should your leather shoes become wet, allow them to dry naturally, never dry them using direct heat or a radiator. natural leather heels and soles are often made up of several layers. leather will expand when wet and should be dried slowly to avoid separation of these layers. store footwear with limited exposure to heat and sunlight. most leathers become hard if they get very wet. once fully dried they may need a day or two to soften up again. using shoe trees or shoe moulds whilst footwear is in storage will maintain the shape of your footwear and help absorb moisture. your shoes will proportionally last longer if you alternate between two or three different styles. we don’t recommend that you wear the same shoes every day as they need time to breathe and to completely dry out. repairing and replacing the sole fine leather soles will wear out quicker than rubber or resin soles. as shoes wear out, a good shoe repair shop should be able to add a fine rubber sole over the damaged sole. heel top pieces wear down and can easily be repaired to prolong the life of your shoes/boots. never allow your heels to wear down past the top piece. how to prevent colour transfer allsaints selects leathers with rich character and natural finishes. due to the natural finishes of our leathers, colour transfer can occur on other materials. avoid contact with light coloured garments. how to break in leather boots when you purchase any footwear, it is always best to wear them for short periods for the first few days to allow the materials to mould around your foot naturally to prevent blisters. it is advisable not to wear the same footwear over consecutive days, this is to allow your feet to relax. how to clean trainers ideally use a professional service. many high street cobblers now have this service. if not, you can clean light marks using a damp (nearly dry) cloth or soft brush. what shoes to wear with midi dresses biker boots, heels, trainers, or even knee high boots hidden underneath - take your pick, anything goes. what to wear with knee high boots from minis to maxis, shorts and culottes - knee high boots work with a range of outfits. whatever your vibe. top back to top customer services customer services contact us delivery returns faqs klarna legal & cookies legal & cookies terms & conditions terms of site use privacy policy cookies tax policy modern slavery act gender pay gap our company our company store locator conscious site map careers press follow us instagram tiktok discord facebook twitter youtube pinterest new to allsaints?
