we're in the midst of our final components, and then all we have to do is put it all together! how did your first sleeve go this week? the trickiest part of the process is picking up stitches. that's not all that difficult once you get the hang of it, but i know i always have trouble keeping them evenly spaced. i mentioned this last week, but in the pattern it suggests using markers to divide the cable band into four sections, and that really helped me. i'm seeing some people in the ravelry group who are already done, and they all look amazing! i'm loving seeing the different colors people chose -- including a couple of people who used more than one. another one this week we are working the second sleeve. i like to keep the first one nearby while i work, so i can make sure everything is matching up exactly. it was a pretty straightforward week, and i managed to finish early. one cure for second sock syndrome is working quickly! i moved ahead to get a jump start on the seaming. put it together i started by laying all the pieces out, to make sure everything was even and i didn't need to fix any mistakes. then, i started pinning the first parts together. the pattern directs you to start by sewing the shoulders, then finishing and attaching the neckline. the shoulder seams are small and quick. you then do a three-needle bind off to attach the two halves of the collar. i had never actually done it before, but it's described well in the pattern. we also have a tutorial if you need extra help. you may prefer other grafting methods, but this one leaves a neat little seam. once you've done that, you pin the collar to the neck of the back piece so it's even and sew it down. once that's attached, it's time to move on to setting in the sleeves and sewing the sides. i'll do that for you next week. then we'll be done, and can figure out how to wear this thing! tagged in: kal, heartland, knit-along, curvy girl cabled cardigan, curvy girl collection, curvy girl knit along, curvy girl kal read more charity 86-year-old donates hundreds of preemie hats by liza eckert november 18, 2016 (photo: the atlanta journal-constitution) retired engineer ed moseley, 86, learned to make hats for preemies, and as a result has now donated hundreds of them to a local neonatal intensive care unit, according to the atlanta journal-constitution. moseley lives in an assisted living facility in acworth, ga, near atlanta. the facility asked its residents to take part in an outreach program making preemie hats for the nicu at nearby northside hospital. he wanted to help, but didn't know how to knit. so he taught himself using a loom. “when they started this project a few months back, i told my daughter about it and i said, ‘how can i knit? what do i need to do?’ and bless her heart, she went to jo-anns [fabrics] and got a kit, yarn and instruction kit for me. so i started slowly and learned it just takes patience,’” he told the ajc. now that he has the hang of loom knitting, a little hat takes about an hour. he often makes them while watching tv. he inspired his neighbors at the assisted living facility, too, and many of them are learning to knit the hats. people have been bringing him their completed hats to donate, as well as balls of yarn for him to use. november 17 was national preemie awareness day, and moseley donated 350 of the hats to the northside hospital nicu. tagged in: loom knitting, charity knitting, knit hats, baby hats, preemie hats read more crocheting, crochet-along ella tied cardigan crochet-along: week 5 by kristy november 18, 2016 welcome to our final post on the ella tied cardigan! i can’t believe it’s over already! it went by so fast! if you are not finished yet (or haven’t even started!), no worries, the posts will always be up and our ravelry thread is not going anywhere! if you are like me, when you purchase or make a piece of clothing with a waistband, it goes missing almost immediately!  i did not want that to happen with this cardi!  after i seamed my sweater and created my waistband, i decided a few waistband -keeping loops were in order!  this extra step was easy!  i tied the waistband in place where it felt most comfortable and marked that with a few pins along the seam line under the arms: i then made two loops by chaining 12, and single crocheting 1 row! tada! i sewed it into place right where i had marked it with the pins.  i repeated for the other side and my waistband was now safe and secure! styling the loops allow me to style the sweater with a bow in the back, leaving the front open and exposing more of my outfit! i had a very difficult time narrowing down which outfits looked best with this cardi. here i included my top 9. i am finding more and more looks every day as the season continues to require additional layers. take a look at the outfits i created here. i find this cardi goes so well with cozy loungewear all the way up to black tie!  i paired it with work wear, date night clothes, sunday best, apple-picking, lunch date, girls night out and on and on and on. tied in front, tied in back, or hanging loose, it’s versatile and cozy and a great outer layer!  pair it with neutrals, stripes, prints or complimentary colors, you may just wear it every day! aren’t you glad you made it? if you look closely you may spot a few other lion brand items in there—my version of loop scarf (my version coming soon in a look for less lion brand yarn youtube video) made up in a bulkier weight, and my giant pom pom pink hat is made with hometown usa in colors: phoenix azalea and new orleans french berry i am so anxious to see your complete ella tied cardigan and how you are styling it.  head on over to ravelry to share and love on everyone’s photos of their creations. thank you as always for having me, until next time, never stop crocheting! tagged in: crochet, cal, kristy glass, crochet-along, 24/7 cotton, ella tied cardigan, fall 2016 crochet-along read more 1 2 3 previous ... next follow us blog facebook twitter youtube pinterest instagram newsletter sign up free patterns, product alerts, and special offers. sign up preferred message format prefer html messages prefer plain text messages our company about us press studio outlet catalog help faqs contact us copyright © 2015 lion brand® yarns. all rights reserved. privacy policy terms of use
