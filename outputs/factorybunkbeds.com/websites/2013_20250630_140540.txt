still save with flat rate $99 shipping to most of the usa! - with standard shipping, consumer costs can double, or even triple by the time you add up all the extra fees per item... but not at factorybunkbeds.com. we use flat rate shipping where there are no hidden costs - you know exactly what you're paying. and because of the large volume we do, we are able to secure the best rates in the industry. flat rate shipping gives you the option of accessorizing to fit your personal style and needs without having to pay additional shipping. our free shipping option, provided by ltl-freight is curbside service only. if you do require inside delivery you can always upgrade your shipping services at checkout. we will customize your delivery to suit your needs. plus, we custom palletize your order so you receive it in pristine condition. some brands have items that are less than $349 that still qualify for free shipping, look for the free shipping icon on the product page. a few exceptions on shipping locations: please understand that we ship from florida, and even though we do ship to all 48 contiguous states there are some remote areas in wa, or, id, mt and ca (furthest away) that we are unable to ship to for this flat or free promotional rate. if your order falls into this category we will call or email you with any extra shipping surcharge the freight company charges us, and you will have the option to cancel your order or pay the extra shipping fees (fees can range between $20-80). additionally, if you are attempting to order only 1 smaller item by itself to any state, we may have to crate this box instead of palletizing in order to protect the contents. if this is the case we will inform you of the extra crate costs and again you will have the option to accept and pay the extra cost, or we can simply void/cancel the order and refund your credit card the full amount. *canada: to our friendly neighbors in the great white north, we offer the always low, flat-rate shipping cost of $249! currently, products made by discovery world furniture and hillsdale furniture are eligible for shipping into canada. requirements for canadian shipments are as follows: first there are the standard shipping charges added to all canadian orders. secondly, after the order is placed a 3rd party broker is contacted to calculate the taxes and duties. orders will not ship out until those fees are collected.the fastest way to order is to place the order online using a visa, mastercard or another credit card so that broker's fees, duties & taxes may be run as soon as they are calculated. this keeps your order moving as quickly as possible. orders paying with paypal historically take a day or two longer because an invoice must be created, emailed to you, the customer and you will have to use the "send money" option to cover the fees. currently, there is no way to list the total costs of duties, taxes and fees prior to making a purchase as they are calculated based on your postal code and the specific products you purchase.as always, we do everything we can to make your experience a pleasure at factory bunkbeds. please leave feedback on your experience. we welcome all comments or questions!what about sales taxes?
