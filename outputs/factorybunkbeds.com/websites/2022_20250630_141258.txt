world furniture finishes discovery world furniture finishes developing a finish is an exhaustive process for discovery world furniture. we strive to make the most our line by offering every relevant model configuration as well as finishes that appeal to most all consumers. our bread and butter style is transitional/mission and we offer a light, a dark, a white, a grey and an espresso. in our new hardwood driftwood collection, we similarly offer a light, a dark and a grey but they are custom multi-process finishes. our finishes are developed to coincide with the style of the piece as well as blending with flooring and wall color tones found in most homes in the us. mission finishes merlot discovery’s merlot finish is our most popular selling finish and the name describes it perfectly….the color of merlot wine. it is our twist on a standard dark finish. it is a 4-step lacquered finish that contains mainly a brown tone with a red highlight and top-coated with a mild sheen. many of our customers call it dark cherry and it works well with the transitional mission styling. honey discovery’s honey finish represents our light finish. there are many honey finishes on the market today and discovery has been developing ours over the past 27 years. it is a 4-step lacquered finish that contains mainly a light neutral tone with a golden highlight and is top-coated with a mild sheen. it is a longstanding winning finish because it adapts well in most home environments and it works well with the transitional mission styling. espresso the name describes it perfectly….the color of espresso coffee. it is a 6-step lacquered finish that contains a very rich, dark brown tone and is top-coated with a moderate sheen. in photography, the finish appears to be opaque but the 6 step finish allows the grain of the wood to shine through. the espresso finish and the line itself is geared toward those looking for a more contemporary higher end feel. the finish works well with the brushed nickel hardware and softens the appearance of the sturdy, beefed up wooden elements of the line that contains 25% more lumber than anything else its class. charcoal discovery’s charcoal finish is extremely popular and represents our version of a grey finish. we found that most grey finishes in the youth market today have an industrial feel. in contrast, charcoal stays true to our transitional/mission roots while adding an exciting brushed texture and slight black glaze that gives it a high-end weathered appearance. charcoal is a 6 step finish and is top coated with a durable wax with a subtle sheen. the finish works well with the brushed nickel hardware and while transitional, can certainly work as a contemporary or coastal finish. white white sounds simple but there are 1000’s of variations of white. discovery’s white is a true pure white. white is a complex finish and if applied correctly, requires multiple steps in the sealing process on solid wood and is typically more expensive. in our case, white is a 6 step finish and is top-coated with a mild sheen. while discovery utilizes mdf on non-structural areas of our white furniture, the use of solid wood is required to insure structural integrity and safety. isolating and sealing the knots is the key to a quality white finish on solid wood. discovery has a developed a cost effective white finish and is a true value in the white youth marketplace. all of this considered, discovery’s white, or any other manufacturers white finish is finicky. expect minor imperfections and understand that a perfect white finish on solid wood is not attainable. driftwood finishes sand discovery’s sand finish is a light rustic finish on solid hardwood. it is a high end finish by any standard. it is a 7-step textured, brushed, wash-glazed and lacquered finish that contains a light neutral base tone and allows us to accentuate the character of the acacia hardwood. the finish is top-coated with a subtle sheen. the sand finish works well with the antique english hardware and is considered to have both a coastal and farmhouse feel. chestnut discovery’s chestnut finish is a dark rustic finish on solid hardwood. it is a high end finish by any standard. it is a 7-step textured, brushed, wash-glazed and lacquered finish that contains a rich dark brown base tone yet allows the character of the acacia hardwood to shine through. the finish is top-coated with a subtle sheen. the chestnut finish works well with the antique english hardware and is considered to have a coastal, a nautical and a farmhouse feel. grey
