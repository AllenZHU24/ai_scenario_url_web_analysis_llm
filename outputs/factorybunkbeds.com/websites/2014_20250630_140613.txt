 we ask that you do not buy from us, rather you take a drawer or piece of the furniture to a local store so you can better match.  the resown being is that when you buy any natural products it can be difficult to match existing items because of the natural variance that occur in solid wood product, and that is the beauty of natural wood.if you are asking because you are worried how we handle damaged or missing pieces then i can tell you that we take care of all replacement parts quickly and at no cost to you, should you have noted freight damage claim or a defective piece or part.  obviously we need you need to visually inspect and count the boxes when they are delivered to protect you and us from shipping damage. if you find a piece with damaged don't panic just notate that part damage and accept the order knowing that we will send you the replacement part you need for free!all that being said this is our return policy ( links below ) and i will tell you that the way we ship the average person could not ( unless you have a forklift and pallet ), meaning that all bed orders ship out on a pallet the boxes are banded and shrink wrapped to the pallet for protection then loaded with our forklifts so drivers do not have to touch our orders.  if you were to want to return the order and the order was already removed from the pallet you would be forced to return the boxes loose thus exposing them to damage.   this is why our return policy has teeth, because almost all returns arrive with at least 25% of the boxes damaged.it is almost better if you wanted to return because you measured wrong or the bed just wont work in the space or for what ever reason, that you try to sell the furniture on craigslist or ebay local pick up only that way you can close to the full price that you paid.  simply cut and past our bed pictures to your listing and put "brand new" in your listing or donate to a local charity or chuch at least you would not give all you money to the shipper.  we have have very few returns and it always pains me when customer have to pay all that money to the freight company because they are the only ones that wins when this happens.  click the links below to see the legalese.shipping information ….   http://www.factorybunkbeds.com/terms-of-use/refund policy ….  http://www.factorybunkbeds.com/refund-policy/shipping policy …..  http://www.factorybunkbeds.com/free-shipping/i hope that this information helps you!thanks, drew posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.how do the metal center support attach on a bookcase day bed.posted on february 10, 2014 posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.how can i replace the bunk bed slats with 3/4" plywood?posted on january 31, 2014 posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.protect you children from bad toothpasteposted on december 4, 2013green square at the base of the tooth paste is natural.....black square is pure chemicaljust fyi   thanks, drew posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.question........can we use a freight forwarder to ship to alaska?posted on november 15, 2013  yes we can ship to a forwarder in seattle, however, we cannot ship replacement parts for free no can we handle any freight claims once the forwarder signs for the order.  you have to pay for them directly and make claims with them should damage occur on their watch.  make sure they can accept and keep the entire order palletized the entire journey we will photograph the inspected order for your protection and ours before the load gets picked up!alaska marine lines can provide this servicethanks, drew posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.simple life hacksposted on november 14, 2013 posted in fun facts and furniture tips by factorybunkbeds.do you sell extra side rails for the lower bed?
