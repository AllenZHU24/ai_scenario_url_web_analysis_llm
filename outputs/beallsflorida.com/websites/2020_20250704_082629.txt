listed on the packing slip but not included in your package, item received differs from item on the packing slip. returning merchandise purchased with a single item promotion returns on single item promotions like “% off one regular, sale or clearance” item may be prorated in certain instances. although at the time of purchase the promotion looks to apply at the item level, there is a scenario where the price reduction on a quantity of 2 or more of the same products will apply equally between each. as a result, if you choose to return a portion of the same merchandise, that applied the single item promotion, your return will be prorated across the quantity of the same merchandise. for example, if there was an extra 40% off a single regular, sale or clearance priced merchandise: $10 (original price) x 2 (quantity) = $20.00 the $4.00 discount is spread across 2 quantity ($10 - $2 = $8.00) $8 x 2 = $16.00 each sku is sale priced at $8.00 on return the customer will receive $8.00 this is a simplified example where additional promotions, rewards, tax, and shipping are not included. cmc content name: mfes footer email sign up get inspired by your inbox the latest looks, the
