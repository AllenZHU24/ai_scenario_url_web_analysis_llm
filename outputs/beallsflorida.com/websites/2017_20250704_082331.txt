physiques. here’s how to decide what will look best on you whether you’re at the pool or on the beach. what is your body type? are you thin and tall, well-muscled or are you a bit on the stocky or round side? you’ll want to choose the most flattering cut depending on your physique. if you’re tall and thin, you may look good in classic boardshorts. men who are big and tall should choose men’s beachwear that’s darker in color and not too tight or too baggy. what do you want to do? if you plan on being active – such as surfing, swimming or playing beach volleyball – you’ll want a different type of men’s swimwear than if you were spending the day lounging in the sun. what do you feel comfortable in? some guys like super-baggy board shorts while others prefer more form-fitting swim trunks. try on a couple of different types to see what is right for you. how many will you need? again, this is a personal preference. if you only go in the water a couple of times a year, then you can get away with one or two swimsuits; if you’re regularly swimming, surfing or participating in other water sports, then you’d probably want to own three or four bathing suits each season. make this
