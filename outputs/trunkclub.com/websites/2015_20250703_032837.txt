right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these terms of service at any time if we do this, we will post the change(s) on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. we will also notify you, either through the services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. your continued use of the service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new terms of service. in addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the service from time to time, including, without limitation, the privacy policy located at www.trunkclub.com/privacy. all such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these terms of service. access and use of the service services and membership description: the service is designed to provide men with great clothes (“items”) selected by our personal stylists from time to time (each shipment of items, a “trunk”). once you create an account, you will become a “member.” for more details about the service, please see www.trunkclub.com. with each trunk, you have ten (10) days after it is delivered to review the selection of items and try them on (“try-on period”). we charge you for all items not returned in accordance with the return policy, below, at the end of the try-on period, although we may bill you earlier in certain circumstances (for example, if you return your trunk before the try-on period is over, if you request us to, if we have reason to believe that the order is fraudulent, if there has been a pattern of credit issues, or if we notify you that we will do so). there are no order minimums or long-term ordering commitments. you may suspend your membership at any time by contacting trunk club customer support at service@trunkclub.com. trunk club reserves the rights to terminate your membership, to refuse any and all current or future use of the site or the service, and not to do business with any member or anyone else, each as trunk club deems appropriate in its sole discretion for any reason. return policy; shipping: you may return any item from a particular trunk you receive through the service (in accordance with the instructions below and those provided with such trunk) within ten (10) days after it is delivered. for free returns, any items must be returned using the pre-paid return label and box provided by trunk club, and items must be unworn (other than “tried-on”), in their original condition and include all original tags and packaging. shipping is not available to all locations. members will not be charged fees for shipping or return shipping, except in special circumstances (where we will give you advance notice) all items you receive through the service will be shipped by a third-party carrier. gift certificates: the purchase of a trunk club gift certificate cannot be redeemed for cash, except to the extent required by applicable law. trunk club gift certificates cannot be resold and are otherwise non-transferrable. referral rewards: we invite and encourage members to earn certain rewards (e.g., credits toward future purchases from trunk club) (“referral rewards”) when they invite friends to become members and those friends make a qualifying purchase from trunk club. your earning and redeeming of referral rewards (the “referral rewards program”) is governed by these terms of service. please see more details on our current referral rewards program at www.trunkclub.com/invite. this offer is limited to one referral and email address per friend, although there is no limit to the number of friends you can invite. you may not spam or send unsolicited emails to persons you do not personally know to collect referral rewards and you may not collect referral rewards by posting on message boards or other online venues in violation of such venues’ terms of use. you agree that your fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by inviting fake people to join trunk club, using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses to sign up for the service, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information to us) or otherwise trying to circumvent the referral rewards program is a violation of these terms of service, which may result in the voiding of your referral rewards and termination of your account. in such case, you may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law. referral rewards cannot be resold and are otherwise non-transferrable. if we terminate the referral rewards program, all referral rewards will be cancelled 30 calendar days after termination of the referral rewards program is announced. for more information about the termination of the service or any portion thereof (including the referral rewards program), please see the termination section, below. trunk club reserves the right in its sole discretion at any time to change or modify the terms applicable to the referral rewards program. such changes may include without limitation, the specific type of reward, how you may earn and spend referral rewards, how long referral rewards last, minimum purchase amounts with which rewards may be used and the lifetime maximum amount of rewards that you may earn. if we do this, we will post the changes to these terms on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. we will also notify you, either through the services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the referral rewards program or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. your

your violation of these terms of service or your violation of any rights of another. if you are a california resident, you waive california civil code section 1542, which says: “a general release does

debtor.” if you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine. disclaimer of warranties your use of the service is at your sole risk. the service is provided on

indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary damages, or damages for loss of profits including but not limited to, damages for loss of goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even

hundred dollars ($100). some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. accordingly, some of the above limitations set forth above may not apply to you. if you are dissatisfied with any portion of the service or with these terms of service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the service. dispute resolution by binding arbitration: please read this section carefully as it affects your rights. most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at service@trunkclub.com. in the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if trunk club has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than $75,000 in damages, trunk club will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. trunk club will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. however, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the aaa rules (as defined below). any arbitration under this agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. arbitration agreement trunk club and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. this agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. it includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this terms of service. references to "trunk club", "you", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the federal communications commission. such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. you agree that, by entering into this terms of service, you and trunk club are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. this terms of service evidences a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. this arbitration provision shall survive termination of this terms of service. a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute ("notice"). the notice to trunk club should be addressed to 325 west ohio street, chicago il 60654 ("notice address"). the notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("demand"). if trunk club and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the notice is received, you or trunk club may commence an arbitration proceeding. during the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by trunk club or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or trunk club is entitled. the arbitration will be governed by the commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively, "aaa rules") of the american arbitration association (“aaa”), as modified by this terms of service, and will be administered by the aaa. the aaa rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the notice address. the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this terms of service. all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. unless trunk club and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. if the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by aaa. if your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules. if your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. trunk club will pay all aaa filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the aaa rules. however, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the aaa rules. the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. you and trunk club agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. further, unless both you and trunk club agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. if this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. notwithstanding any provision in this terms of service to the contrary, we agree that if trunk club makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice address) while you are a user of the trunk club web site, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the arbitration notice address provided above. by rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision. termination you agree that trunk club, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the service and remove and discard any content within the service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if trunk club believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these terms of service. any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. trunk club may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. you agree that any termination of your access to the service under any provision of this terms of service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that trunk club may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the service. further, you agree that trunk club will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the service. user disputes you agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the service and trunk club will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. trunk club reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the service. general these terms of service constitute the entire agreement between you and trunk club and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements between you and trunk club with respect to the service. you also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. these terms of service will be governed by the laws of the state of illinois without regard to its conflict of law provisions. with respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and trunk club agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within chicago, illinois. the failure of trunk club to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms of service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. if any provision of
