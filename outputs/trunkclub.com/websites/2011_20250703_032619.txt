(acknowledge rampant speculation here.) what if i am near chicago? if you live in chicago or are planning a visit, come see us! we’d be happy to do an in-person fitting with you one-on-one at our headquarters. it usually takes about an hour and we do all the work for you. trunk club is not shopping. we offer complimentary shipping back home for visitors so you don’t have to do extra packing. once i sign up, how long will it take for someone to contact me? we’re frequently overwhelmed with the quantity of new clients signing up for our service. we want to ensure our existing clients are getting served before we take on new ones, so new clients may face a delay of a few days. if you’ve just signed up and haven’t heard back yet from a stylist, please bear with us, we haven’t forgotten about you! if you just can’t wait – you’ve had a critical wardrobe malfunction or face some other kind of clothing emergency – please contact our team at service@trunkclub.com with the nature of your emergency and we’ll connect you right away. how long will it take to receive my clothes? it depends on where you live. you can expect your clothes to arrive 3-5 business days via fedex after your first conversation with your expert. for in-person fittings, you take your clothes with you out the door. how do returns work? when we pick out a trunk for you, we understand that not everything in it is going to work. when you receive your trunk, try everything on at home. if something doesn’t fit or you just don’t like it, send it right back to us in its original condition. we ask that you get any returns back in the mail within 10 days of receiving it. we include a pre-paid fedex return label in every order to make shipping highly convenient. when do i pay? we’ll ask for your credit card information before sending your order, but it won’t be charged until you’ve had the chance to try on the clothes we’ve sent you and decide what to keep. we’ll assume you’re keeping the whole thing if we don’t receive a return from you within 30 days of ship date. how frequently will you send me a trunk? it’s up to you. we send you trunks when you request them. however, if you’d like to schedule trunks to arrive on a periodic basis, just discuss it with your expert and he or she will keep your wardrobe updated at the period you specify. who are trunk club’s experts? trunk club experts are trained in men’s clothing and have a keen eye for style and significant experience in the fashion industry. several of our experts are regular contributors to fashion publications, television shows, and well-read blogs. do you serve women? we don’t sell women’s clothes, but… we help women help their guys to dress better! (if you want to grease the wheels, try a gift certificate. works every time.) ladies tell us they love our service too! is trunk club connected to bonobos in some way? brian spaly, our ceo, started bonobos. bonobos is one of our favorite brands to send to customers, but there is no official connection between the two companies other than a vendor relationship. do you have gift certificates? yes, we can mail or email you one in any amount over $250. purchase one here. do you custom tailor clothes? no. we do not currently offer custom suits/shirts or tailoring. who at trunk club headquarters has the most mellifluous voice? our chief of staff, neil kamireddy, hands down. please call (312) 266-8700 and ask for neil to hear for yourself. (neil had to give up several million tastebuds to achieve this. but that’s a longer story.) my question wasn’t answered! that’s not a question. email our team anytime at service@trunkclub.com and we’ll get right back to you. tweet in chicago? come see us. get outfitted in person at our headquarters. “i loved my clothes: my shoes. my pants. my new jacket. i even had fun getting them. within an hour i had a completely new wardrobe. why spend a precious saturday hitting crowded department when i could get everything i need in one session - and have a blast at the same time?” babak, chicago get started about us blog careers contact us developers how it works our clothes faq chicago testimonials press gifts for men privacy facebook | share this twitter | share this contact our trunk club team anytime: service@trunkclub.com | (312) 266-8700 | 311 w. superior st, ste 504, chicago, il 60654 powered by olark
