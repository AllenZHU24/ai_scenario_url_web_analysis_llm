trunk club welcome to the trunk club trunk club is revolutionizing the way men buy apparel. we do the shopping and the styling, ship product to you, and you keep only the items that fit well and look great. you pay retail prices and all of our services and shipping are free. we make money because we buy product at wholesale just like a retail store. you make out like a bandit because you never have to set foot in the dreaded shopping mall again. you should join our club if you like the idea of having a supportive and proactive personal concierge to take care of your wardrobe needs at a reasonable price. we started trunk club because we realized that most guys don’t enjoy the process of shopping, and most guys don’t have time for it anyway. you’d rather be spending time with your family and friends, reading and relaxing, hunting and fishing and watching football. but you don’t want to look like a buffoon when you are doing all those things – you want clothes that fit well and bring an element of style and cohesion to your overall appearance. trunk club is a service designed for all men. personal shopping has existed forever, but has almost exclusively focused on the high net worth individual, the private jet guy with $200 underwear who showers in patron silver tequila and plays tennis barefoot on bentgrass courts with ruby-encrusted lines. our trunk club members are more likely to play softball in beer leagues, enter triathlons, and eat at the buffet in vegas. there are no hidden membership fees or expenses. there are subtle benefits: better style, more free time, and expert advice at your fingertips. here is more detail on the process: we connect you with one of our trunk club “experts”. this person becomes your friendly and supportive liaison and strategist throughout the process. the expert listens to your clothing needs, style preferences and desired spending levels and synthesizes them for our creative team in chicago. you interact with your expert primarily over email and webcam for ease and convenience. (if you don’t have a webcam, we’ll send you one free when you try our service.) the next step of the process is for the chicago style wizards to assemble and ship you a “trunk” of hand-selected apparel from leading men’s brands from around the world (john varvatos, agave, tommy john, ben sherman, bonobos). when you receive your “trunk,” you reconnect with your expert via webcam and get unfettered, honest feedback on how all of clothes we send you look and fit. often times our members will invite their wife or girlfriend to participate in that session as well. single and married members alike value the direct and candid opinions. that said, only you decide what to keep and what to send back. returns are easy: a prepaid fedex return shipping label is included. as seen on the today show ©2009 the trunk club | all rights reserved
