close × watch video close please make sure that your password is entered in correctly by using the show button located next to the password field. keep in mind that passwords must contain at least 8 or more characters, a mix of upper and lower case letters (at least one upper case letter), and at least one number. if you're getting a "please correct your email or password" error, you may be inputting an address or password that does not match what we have on file for your account. some of the more common reasons for this are: - quotation marks, brackets or spaces before or after the email address - automatic fill-in of password information by your computer - additional characters or spaces from your email address we recommend that you manually type your email address and password. if that does not resolve the issue, you can also reset your password. how do i add a gift to my ecard?
