(hint: this would make a great gift for the grandparents!) visit the old stomping grounds our hometowns are very much a part of who we are today. although they grow and change, we can still find parts of ourselves in familiar places. have your parents give your kids a glimpse into what their childhood was like. if your mom and dad’s hometowns are relatively local, have them take your kids on a car ride to where they grew up. this could be a drive by their respective childhood homes, stopping for a bite to eat at their favorite restaurant, or seeing where they used to hang out. pen pal project we may be biased, but we think handwriting cards and letters is still alive and well. sure, texting is great, but cards and letters give us something tangible to hold on to and cherish for years. (and who doesn’t love getting snail mail from someone special?) have your child start writing letters to grandma and grandpa. maybe each letter or card exchange follows a theme. for example, each of you has to describe your dream vacation—where it’d be, who you’d go with, and what you’d do. another fun variation of this idea is to create a bundle of open when cards. both grandparents and grandkids will look forward to opening cards with personalized messages throughout the year. video chat dates schedules fill up and distance can keep us from seeing our loved ones as often as we’d like. keep the lines of communication open by scheduling a weekly video chat date between your kid(s) and their grandparents. just like the pen pal idea, these chats can have a different theme each week, or they can use it as a chance just to catch up. bon appétit! they say cooking feeds the soul, but you don’t need to be julia child to appreciate spending some quality time in the kitchen. cooking with someone you love is a great way to make lasting memories, so grab an apron and whip up your favorite recipes with your grandma or grandpa. is there a recipe he or she loves most? a meal they especially enjoy making? swap ideas or even experiment with different ingredients to come up with a new recipe that’s completely your own. keeping their memory alive if you or your children no longer have grandparents, consider doing something to honor their memory, whether it’s thumbing through an old photo album, recounting your favorite stories of them, or quietly remembering them in a spot they once loved. no matter how your children nurture their relationship with their grandparents, it’s vital that they (and you) seize the opportunity while they can. quality time, good communication, and love are what it’s all about! filed under: uncategorized 5 tips for connecting with your middle schooler (plus free coloring pages!) july 6 by american greetings leave a comment got a middle schooler? we feel you! and they’re feeling everything. puberty isn’t just kicking things up a notch; it’s kicking everything completely off the charts, leaving you trying to connect with them as best as you can, while simultaneously parenting from the sidelines. though you might be feeling like […] continue reading » filed under: diy, downloadables, family meaningful summer printable print june 18 by american greetings 1 comment here we are in the heat of summer – floating in a sea of freshly-made memories or anxiously awaiting the ones that lie just around the bend in the lazy, hazy, sunshiny days ahead. in either case, we’re all grabbing hold of all of the meaningful moments that come […] continue reading » filed under: diy, downloadables, printable, quotes, summer printable summer quotes june 17 by american greetings 1 comment blue skies. warm sunshine. gentle, swaying breezes. summer’s such a beautiful time of year, isn’t it? yet with the many demands of our busy lives, we may all be just a little guilty of forgetting that we can make it as fun and rewarding as we want to. the […] continue reading » filed under: fun activities, inspiration, printable, printables, quotes, summer, tips tagged with: give meaning, making a meaningful summer, meaningful summer, printable summer quoteshello, summer!
