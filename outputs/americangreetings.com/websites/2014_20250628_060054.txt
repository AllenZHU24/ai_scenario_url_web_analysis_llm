do you know someone who could use a helping hand or just a little hello? add your signature to a card for addie by friday, december 19, 2014 and american greetings send a card on your behalf for free. also, you can find out more ways that kathy davis studios is living their mission to “scatter joy: joy through art, joy through living, joy through giving” here. filed under: christmas, kathy davis a free printable hanukkah game december 15 by american greetings leave a comment happy hanukkah! this year as we look to celebrate the festival of lights, we also thought that it might be fun to create a free printable hanukkah game to test your holiday history skills. you can either take the test below on your own or save it to your desktop […] continue reading » filed under: downloadables, hanukkah tagged with: free printable hanukkah gamechristmas cards for addie december 9 by american greetings leave a comment when we heard the story of little addie, we couldn’t help but be touched by the difficulties her family is facing right now.  at the age of 6, addie has experienced an unexplained atrophy of her brain that has left her losing muscular control as well as suffering from […] continue reading » filed under: uncategorized warm, personal christmas card sayings december 9 by american greetings leave a comment last week one of our incredibly talented christmas card editors, courtney rabideau, shared some great tips on what to write in a christmas card. we’re hoping it got you in the christmas spirit and ready to write out those christmas cards! we know a lot of people struggle with finding […] continue reading » filed under: christmas tagged with: christmas card sayingswhat to write in a christmas card december 4 by american greetings leave a comment these tips come to you from american greetings christmas card editor, courtney rabideau… to me, christmas is about moments. in one of my favorites from my childhood, i am seven, and my parents have just given me the christmas present of my dreams – an oak bookcase. the picture of […] continue reading » filed under: christmas, what to write tagged with: what to write in a christmas carddecember birthday fun facts november 30 by american greetings leave a comment tis the season! happy birthday to all december babies! during this wonderful (although cold) month, winter officially begins in the northern hemisphere. but are all of you snow babies really in the know about your birth month?
