oil for hair, castor oil has numerous benefits, including nourishing the hair and promoting and improving scalp health. castor oil contains high levels of ricinoleic acid, a humectant that stimulates blood flow to the scalp, thus strengthening hair strands. featuring antimicrobial properties, castor oil can reduce scalp inflammation. you can also use castor oil as a moisture sealant, shine enhancer, or pre-shampoo treatment that opens up the cuticle. what are the benefits of coconut oil for hair? coconut oil can benefit hair in many ways, such as by moisturizing hair and strengthening the hair cuticle. additionally, coconut oil can prevent hair damage and, when applied to wet hair before shampooing, protect against protein loss. by helping to keep your strands hydrated and strong, the coconut oil in our goddess strength 7 oil blend hair & scalp oil may also promote healthy hair growth. what are the benefits of jojoba oil for hair? many are curious about the benefits of jojoba oil for hair. jojoba oil has numerous benefits for the hair, including nourishing strands and reducing frizz by sealing in hydration when hair is wet. other benefits include antifungal and antibacterial properties, which can help to keep your scalp healthy and your dandruff under control. jojoba oil can also act as a heat protectant by creating a protective coating for your hair. additionally, jojoba oil can be helpful for those experiencing postpartum hair thinning, as jojoba oil contains linoleic acid and is rich in vitamins a and e, all of which promote hair growth and thickness. what are the benefits of olive oil for hair? olive oil has many benefits for hair, such as moisturizing and nourishing hair strands. rich in antioxidants plus fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid, olive oil is ideal for dry, thick, coarse hair. when applied to the hair’s surface, olive oil smooths out the hair cuticle and locks in moisture, making olive oil useful for reducing frizz. olive oil also coats hair with shine, giving strands a glossy appearance. how often should you oil your hair? hair oiling is an important step for ensuring that your hair stays healthy. it is suggested that you oil your hair daily, but at least twice a week is recommended. those with coarse, thick curls and coils can use heavier moisturizing oils as their pre-shampoo or deep conditioning treatment. on the other hand, those with thin or fine hair are a better match for lightweight oils, which should be applied to the ends of the hair and, if needed, up to the middle of the hair shaft. blended with shea butter plus jojoba, coconut, olive, amazonian nut, and babassu oils, carol’s daughter born to repair reviving hair oil is a lightweight hair oil that is ideal for hair types 2a to 4c. what does a hot oil treatment do for your hair? if you’re wondering what a hot oil treatment does for your hair, a hot oil treatment offers many benefits, such as intensely moisturizing and strengthening strands and protecting them from damage. a hot oil treatment can also control dandruff and frizz, repair split ends, and improve scalp circulation. in addition, hot oil treatments can help add shine and, by sealing the cuticle, cut down on frizz. all these benefits make a hot oil treatment excellent for anyone with dry, curly, or frizzy hair. in a hot oil treatment, plant-based oils such as coconut oil or olive oil are warmed up and then applied to the hair to seal the cuticle. a hot oil treatment can be left in the hair anywhere from 15 minutes to overnight. to remove the hot oil treatment, shampoo your hair to rinse out the oil. how do you use hair oil? there are many ways you can use hair oil, before and after you shower, and on both wet or dry hair. moisturizing hair oils like coconut oil can be used as a pre-shampoo treatment, in which the hair oil is applied to your hair before you apply shampoo and conditioner. castor oil can be used as an intensely moisturizing hair mask to replace your conditioner. use a sealing oil like jojoba oil as part of the loc method. first, apply your moisturizing product, such as a leave-in conditioner or styling product, and then use your sealing oil. finally, layer a cream product on top to maximize your hair’s moisture retention. to tame frizz and flyaways, apply a little bit of olive oil or sunflower seed oil to your palm, rub your palms together, and then smooth your hands over the surface of your hair; both olive oil and sunflower seed oil are emollients that smooth the cuticle to add moisture and shine. carol’s daughter goddess strength 7 oil blend hair & scalp oil has coconut oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, sunflower seed oil, olive oil, and other oils. is oil good for curly

been. i am grateful for this oil. it is not heavy or greasy. it smells good and has pretty packaging. i’m definitely keeping this in my arsenal. date published: 2024-10-24 rated 4 out of 5 by stephanie smkslp from 5/5 thus far.... i just purchased this product today during my walgreens run after seeing an advertisement online on my ibotta app. i have blonde-brown, natural fine, rather thin hair. i've colored & highlighted it most of my life & it has stayed relatively healthy, no issues with my scalp. however, nothing is worse than the fact that i had become an absolute stranger, & with no informed consent, due to the menopausal changes occurring to my facial & decoletté skin, scalp & hair. i have finally gained some control over my entire skin with a new & varied routine, including gentle oils for the scalp. thus far, i have sucessfully avoided both chemical & botox/needle invasive interventions, processes, procedures or surgery by a dermatologist who would have to use invasive techniques, on an approximate 5-6 inch in diameter circle of skin on my scalp & including along the left frontal hairline. the left frontal scalp region that breaks out in the most awful sweat pattern, that is actually visible as the pores dilate & the sweat "bubbles & wicks" into the hair in this region. it has become so painful due to the dryness. i tried this tonight after my shower, & although it is just one use post-hair wash with my gentle chinese lonshen rice shampoo & conditioner to nourish scalp & hair after a 15- minute rosemary & biotin scalp pretreat, i must say, this feels beautiful on the hair and scalp. it feels much more like an actual beauty treatment (rather than the almost clinical aspect & trial & error of products & professional sought out advice i've had to do to get control of this issue) due to the smell & immediate soaking into the skin on my scalp. i have a distinct feeling this will become a ride-along partner in my continued journey towards healthy skin & hair. i'll do a follow-up review in about a months time to let you all know how it's going. oh, and p.s., my husband saw my new product & smelled my damp hair after my shower after my 1st treatment session, & he thought it smelled amazing. so much so, he let me put some in his hair after his bedtime shower & routine & he really likes the feel & scent. goes to show the product is not too heavily scented feminine vs masculine but just a nice, clean and natural fragrance due to the particular 7 oils carol's daughter used to create it. date published: 2024-10-22 rated 5 out of 5 by bri80 from great product love, love the smell and absolutely moisturizing for your scalp!!! i have tried so many products on my sons hair and this is the best!!! date published: 2024-10-13 rated 4 out of 5 by jsashaye from okay not bad. i used it for my daughter after braiding her hair and it helped keep her scalp moisturized. i just felt like getting hair was drying out kinda fast. the scent isn’t bad but not my favorite and the nozzle at the tip is convenient. date published: 2024-09-29 rated 5 out of 5 by stephs55 from great blend ❤️ i received two goddess strength products for free from influenster and carol’s daughter in exchange for my honest review. loved the 7 oil blend and the smooth and shape balm. they both kept our hair moisturized and the sweet scent was fantastic. the consistency of the cream was thick more of a butter i felt like it helped really penetrate into our hair when added with to the oil. date published: 2024-09-24 rated 3 out of 5 by chrissymonaee from it’s ok not the best oil i have used. i didn’t like the smell too much and the applicator tip was hard to use the first time. once i did get it open the oil was fine. date published: 2024-09-07 rated 4 out of 5 by seannap1 from great hair oil! loved the scent of this oil! it is lightweight and great for natural or relaxed hair. it great for the scalp or sealing the ends. the packaging is all sleek! date published: 2024-08-30 rated 5 out of 5 by lawrence0304 from feels great i’ve been using carol's daughter goddess strength 7 oil blend for just a few weeks, and the difference is incredible. my hair feels stronger, with less breakage, and has a beautiful shine. the oil is light, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly, leaving my scalp feeling healthy. plus, the scent is lovely and subtle. this has become a must-have in my hair care routine! date published: 2024-08-22 goddess strength 7 oil blend scalp & hair oil reviews - page 2 y_2024, m_12, d_11, h_8 bvseo_bulk, prod_bvrr,
