founder, carol’s daughter home about us our founder lisa price’s journey begins like that of many entrepreneurs—with curiosity and determination mixed with moments of panic and a resounding belief that products that were made with love and delivered on their promise would find their following. it was a company born of price’s love for fragrance and a passion for scent alchemy that formed the foundation of her high-performing products. more than a quarter of a century later, even amid massive industry disruption, new company leadership, and acquisition by l’oréal, carol’s daughter continues to thrive and remain relevant in an industry where brands come and go as quickly as trends change. carol’s daughter began in price’s brooklyn kitchen. with a career in tv production, mixing up fragrances, perfume sprays, and creams served as a creative outlet. it wasn’t long before price began dabbling in aromatherapeutic oils, educating herself on their healing properties. in 1993, price, with the gentle nudge from her mother carol, began to sell her products. with $100 in cash and a cramped kitchen, she crafted a collection that would become the foundation of a beauty empire. selling her homespun concoctions at flea markets, and later out of her living room, favorable word-of-mouth began to spread for early iterations of almond cookie, hair milk, and black vanilla hair smoothie—all of which retain their cult status today. “to name my company, i listed everything i was, and wanted to be, and realized the most special thing that i am, is lisa, carol’s daughter.” over the next few years, word spread, with celebrities like jada pinkett-smith, erykah badu, rosie perez, and halle berry becoming loyal customers. joining the l’oréal family in november 2014, carol's daughter widened its extensive footprint, selling its hair, body, and skincare solutions nationwide at key retailers. during the obama administration, price was appointed to the national women’s business council, an independent source of advice and policy recommendations to the president, congress, and the u.s. small business administration, on economic issues that face female business owners. price was featured in the film she did that (2019) and is the recipient of numerous awards, including the national black mba association's entrepreneur of the year award (2000), the working woman magazine’s entrepreneurial excellence award (2001), and a cosmetic executive women achiever award (2010). she is also the author of “success never smelled so sweet,” a memoir that chronicles her transformation from a young black woman deep in debt to president of a paradigm-changing business. price is also a member of the board of directors for first watch restaurants (july 2020.) in april 2021, price and carol’s daughter partnered with the world-renown doula latham thomas and her foundation, the mama glow foundation to launch love delivered, an initiative focused on raising awareness of the black maternal health crisis in the united states and the importance of advocates and doulas at the times when black birthing people and babies are most vulnerable---before, during and after birth. love delivered is working to positively impact the lives of black birthing people and babies by raising awareness about black maternal health amongst 100 million people and directly engaging 10,000 people to be advocates. price still plays the role of founder of carol’s daughter within l’oreal. it is who she is and who she will always be. she continues to oversee product development, brand vision, advertising and consumer communications, as well as actively educating the sales force on carol's daughter. price is also a part of the executive committee at l’oreal usa giving her perspective on black culture, diversity equality and inclusion and organizational topics. price and her husband, gordon, have three children and still live in brooklyn. when she can find the time, price enjoys going to the beach, reading, crocheting, knitting, and watching movies. curl type quiz hey curl, what's your type? take the quiz, learn your curl type, get matched with products to help
