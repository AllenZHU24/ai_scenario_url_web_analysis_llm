write a review read all reviews how to use what it does ingredients research let’s start with the monoi repairing shampoo, which is sulfate-free so you know it’s safe for color-treated or any other chemically treated hair, and it won’t strip away your natural moisture. wet your hair, start massaging your hair and whip up a good lather for 1 minute or 2 so the shampoo can do its job. rinse out the shampoo with warm water, then work the monoi repairing conditioner into your wet hair. detangle hair with your fingers and be sure to cover all your hair with the rich cream. leave in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes, then rinse out. next, shake the monoi anti-breakage spray well, making sure the two parts have fully combined. hold 6 to 8 inches away from wet hair and spray all-over to strengthen as you detangle. don’t rinse out. now let’s repair those split ends: lightly press down on the pump of the split end sealer to apply a pea-sized amount to wet or dry hair. make sure to smooth completely through to the ends. style as usual. clinically tested and proven results 1 use. 5x longer hair life. 92% less breakage.* the monoi repairing collection is the #1 selling hair

instrumental results versus control the sacred monoi ritual pure monoi oil draws its strength from the coral-rich soil of the tahitian islands that gives both the tiare gardenia and coprah coconuts concentrated proteins. tiare gardenia flowers and coprah coconuts, which are only found on the islands of tahiti, are harvested in the mornings when their nutrients are the most powerful. each island has its own dedicated mamá who holds the secret recipe. she selects only the fi nest tiare buds that are about to open and dries the best coconut pulp. the pistils are carefully removed from 15 tiare blossoms, making sure to keep the petals intact. then she takes 15 ounces from the fi rst cold press of the coprah coconut. then the blossoms, still unopened, are placed on top of the coprah coconut oil, and for 15 days, as the blossoms open, the oils blend together, forming the potent repairing monoi oil. no sulfates, no parabens, no petroleum, no mineral oil, no artificial colors monoi
