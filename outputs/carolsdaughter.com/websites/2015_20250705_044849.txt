" genetics also play a significant role in the growth or loss of hair. we're born with a specific number of hair follicles, which cannot be changed and typically we lose 100 strands per day. if you want your hair to grow faster or are experiencing hair loss, start with the basics: proper nutrition, lots of water, beauty sleep, and a less stressful lifestyle. make sure to treat your hair with care with active natural ingredients found in our hair products that are especially beneficial to the scalp. q: how do i keep my hair from getting too dry? a: many of the seasonal elements can damage hair and make it dry. uv rays, salt water, etc. first, switch to an extra-hydrating shampoo and conditioner. rosemary mint and khoret amen shampoo both contain conditioning sea moss which is especially beneficial for dry, brittle hair. also, for twisted tresses and unmanageably dry hair, a nourishing, leave-in conditioner twice a week is essential for restoring weight, texture, and moisture. and since dry hair means you're suffering from a dry scalp too, a hair oil or conditioning hair dress will help nourish and bring back sheen and suppleness. finally, never expose unprotected hair to the sun, salt, or chlorine for prolonged periods of time or it will get stripped of its natural color and be prone to frizz. q: how do i control the "frizzies?" a: fight the "frizzies" with a nourishing, leave-in conditioner that adds weight, texture, and moisture. but beware! less is more and too much will weigh down the hair, making it look greasy instead of gorgeous. face q: how do i get rid of dry, chapped lips and make them beautiful? a: the warm or cold weather can wreak havoc on skin and lips, causing severe dryness. you need treatments that will penetrate beyond the skin's surface to help heal and hydrate. all of our lip products contain extremely generous amounts of natural, healing ingredients. candy paint lip glosses offer all the benefits to have a picture-perfect pout. q: my face is very oily. how do i keep my skin clean and refreshed? a: the skin's oil is produced bysebaceous glands. these glands are located deep within our skin and are most plentiful in the face, neck, chest, head and back -- one reason that these areas appear to be affected by oil production the most. the amount of oil you produce can be inherited or affected by hormone levels or irritation. avoid the urge to get squeaky clean skin and cleanse gently with carol's daughter wash away the oil face wash. it will remove excess oil while leaving the oil your skin needs to maintain its health intact. take care not to over-wash oily skin as irritation encourages oil production. instead refresh with a toner such as carol's daughter lemongrass and geranium toner. because an oily complexion often feels moist to the touch, many people avoid using moisturizers, because they think they will only make matters worse. experts disagree. moisture retention is increasingly important as you age and during colder months... even for oily skin. skin q: i want my hands to be soft and young-looking. what do i do? a: your hands are a dead give away for your true age. turn back time with rejuvenating hand care products. treat the skin on your hands with the same care as the skin on your face. hands tend to show signs of aging first. during the day, hydrate hands with lemon and rose hand cream (voted "best hand product" by health magazine). at night, repair them with exfoliating sea salt in lemon ginger mint manicure in a jar. you'll wake up with the baby-soft hands. find us on... about us lisa’s story our mission in the press career opportunities stores & events mirror salon videos customer service faq's shipping policy international shipping return policy track your order sms membership contact us popular searches hair milk monoi lisa's hair elixir black vanilla natural hair almond cookie kids hairdress from humble beginnings in her kitchen, carol’s daughter founder lisa price transformed her beloved hobby of mixing fragrances at home into a beauty empire. after selling her natural beauty products at flea markets and from her living room, price officially established carol's daughter, lovingly named for her mother. today, we offer prestige hair, body and skincare products made with rare, natural ingredients like monoi oil, shea and cocoa butters and açai. we have collections that repair (top-seller monoi), perfect curls (classic hair milk) and soothe skin (favorite almond cookie). privacy policy terms *up to 10 autodialed marketing msg/mo. standard msg & data rates may apply. consent not req to purchase. help=help, stop=stop copyright carol’s daughter, consumer products division of l’oreal usa s/d, inc. 99 hudson st., new york, ny 10013. all rights reserved. our customer service hours of operation are monday – friday, 10 am – 6 pm (et). 877-540-2101
