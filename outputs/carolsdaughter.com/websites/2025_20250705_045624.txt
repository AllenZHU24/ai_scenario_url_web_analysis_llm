questions answers to your frequently asked questions what are the benefits of castor oil for hair? if you’re wondering what are the benefits of castor oil for hair, castor oil has numerous benefits, including nourishing the hair and promoting and improving scalp health. castor oil contains high levels of ricinoleic acid, a humectant that stimulates blood flow to the scalp, thus strengthening hair strands. featuring antimicrobial properties, castor oil can reduce scalp inflammation. you can also use castor oil as a moisture sealant, shine enhancer, or pre-shampoo treatment that opens up the cuticle. what are the benefits of coconut oil for hair? coconut oil can benefit hair in many ways, such as by moisturizing hair and strengthening the hair cuticle. additionally, coconut oil can prevent hair damage and, when applied to wet hair before shampooing, protect against protein loss. by helping to keep your strands hydrated and strong, the coconut oil in our goddess strength 7 oil blend hair & scalp oil may also promote healthy hair growth. what are the benefits of jojoba oil for hair? many are curious about the benefits of jojoba oil for hair. jojoba oil has numerous benefits for the hair, including nourishing strands and reducing frizz by sealing in hydration when hair is wet. other benefits include antifungal and antibacterial properties, which can help to keep your scalp healthy and your dandruff under control. jojoba oil can also act as a heat protectant by creating a protective coating for your hair. additionally, jojoba oil can be helpful for those experiencing postpartum hair thinning, as jojoba oil contains linoleic acid and is rich in vitamins a and e, all of which promote hair growth and thickness. what are the benefits of olive oil for hair? olive oil has many benefits for hair, such as moisturizing and nourishing hair strands. rich in antioxidants plus fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid, olive oil is ideal for dry, thick, coarse hair. when applied to the hair’s surface, olive oil smooths out the hair cuticle and locks in moisture, making olive oil useful for reducing frizz. olive oil also coats hair with shine, giving strands a glossy appearance. how often should you oil your hair? hair oiling is an important step for ensuring that your hair stays healthy. it is suggested that you oil your hair daily, but at least twice a week is recommended. those with coarse, thick curls and coils can use heavier moisturizing oils as their pre-shampoo or deep conditioning treatment. on the other hand, those with thin or fine hair are a better match for lightweight oils, which should be applied to the ends of the hair and, if needed, up to the middle of the hair shaft. blended with shea butter plus jojoba, coconut, olive, amazonian nut, and babassu oils, carol’s daughter born to repair reviving hair oil is a lightweight hair oil that is ideal for hair types 2a to 4c. what does a hot oil treatment do for your hair? if you’re wondering what a hot oil treatment does for your hair, a hot oil treatment offers many benefits, such as intensely moisturizing and strengthening strands and protecting them from damage. a hot oil treatment can also control dandruff and frizz, repair split ends, and improve scalp circulation. in addition, hot oil treatments can help add shine and, by sealing the cuticle, cut down on frizz. all these benefits make a hot oil treatment excellent for anyone with dry, curly, or frizzy hair. in a hot oil treatment, plant-based oils such as coconut oil or olive oil are warmed up and then applied to the hair to seal the cuticle. a hot oil treatment can be left in the hair anywhere from 15 minutes to overnight. to remove the hot oil treatment, shampoo your hair to rinse out the oil. how do you use hair oil? there are many ways you can use hair oil, before and after you shower, and on both wet or dry hair. moisturizing hair oils like coconut oil can be used as a pre-shampoo treatment, in which the hair oil is applied to your hair before you apply shampoo and conditioner. castor oil can be used as an intensely moisturizing hair mask to replace your conditioner. use a sealing oil like jojoba oil as part of the loc method. first, apply your moisturizing product, such as a leave-in conditioner or styling product, and then use your sealing oil. finally, layer a cream product on top to maximize your hair’s moisture retention. to tame frizz and flyaways, apply a little bit of olive oil or sunflower seed oil to your palm, rub your palms together, and then smooth your hands over the surface of your hair; both olive oil and sunflower seed oil are emollients that smooth the cuticle to add moisture and shine. carol’s daughter goddess
