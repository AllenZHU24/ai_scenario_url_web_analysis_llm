a friend told me about decorate today years ago, and i've used your products and your website ever since. thanks again for having such a wonderful website, products and people to help me out!” cheryl f. from south riding, virginia “tiffany has always been helpful, patient and pleasant and has made all my shopping experiences with your company such a pleasure. i enjoy working with her. it's is hard to find people that are willing to take the time and explain and review things with you when you are making a large purchase. she reassures me and makes me feel as if i am the only customer that matters.” debbie n. from “im just writing to tell you about the extremely positive experience i had with ashaunta. i called this morning with a question and a problem and ashaunta went above and beyond to assist me and rectify my problem. she was extremely courteous and professional and very knowledgeable regarding the product we were discussing. i not only have a positive impression of ashaunta, but with american blinds as well. i can assure you that i will definitely do business with your company again and i will recommend american blinds to all of my friends and family.” fran p. from new city, new york “your website, along with your customer service representatives, are first rate! i have always received my orders promptly, and i have never had any issues with products i have received from american blinds. my husband & i built our home in 2004. there are 43 windows in our home, and every one of them has been "dressed" by american blinds -- we get many compliments on our window decor, and i am always happy to recommend american blinds to everyone who sees our windows. thank you for such excellent products and customer service.” deborah h. from “thank you very much for your time and effort in trying to locate the wallpaper. you have been extremely helpful and i greatly appreciate your efforts. i believe you have done all that you can. i have been impressed with your level of dedication, persistance and desire to provide excellent customer service. i don't think that i have ever had such good customer service from a company. thank you again for all your help.” sandra l. from “thank you so much for the product and service you provide. i installed the blinds in my home and they changed the look of the room 100% for the better. we replaced regular shades with the 2" blinds and now the room has the resort feel. the product exceeded my expectations and they work beautifully.” kristin w. from “ i wish to thank you and customer service. the order shipped the wrong bar, but you all responded quickly and i just received the correct bar. there was no problem other than the wrong shipment. i'm pleased with your organization and customer support. i will recommend your shop to family and friends.” alvah s. from “we received our blinds yesterday, days before expected and they are beautiful! they were easy to install and we saved about $600 over ordering them from home depot! thanks and i will recommend your service to others.” theresa from west pawlet, vermont “i ordered all of my blinds from your company. the quality is great, the fit was perfect, the prices are the best i've found. free shipping has sold me as well! i will continue to order from your website! i've also recommended it to my friends!” maria from plano, texas “i ordered your 'sarah' curtains and am so pleased with them....they're beautiful. i was concerned about the material when i ordered them and your customer assistant told me i would love the material...she was right, i do!! i put white sheers behind them and they are elegant looking. fast shipping, good price and excellent customer service! you rate aaa with me!” jerri from nesbit, mississippi “i painted and wallpapered my bathroom over the weekend and it looks absolutely wonderful. the wallpaper was even prettier than it was on your website. i dont think my bathroom has ever looked this good. just wanted you to know. cant wait to have company so i can show it off.” susan h. from albany, new york email your testimonial or mail your testimonial to: american blinds & wallpaper attn:	marketing	department 10255 richmond ave, #300 houston, tx 77042 connect with us facebook youtube pinterest houzz blinds & shades cellular shades faux wood blinds mini blinds pleated shades roller shades roman shades sheer vertical blinds shutters (interior) vertical blinds window shadings wood blinds woven woods resource center customer testimonials decorating tips do it yourself videos featured articles how to install blinds how to measure blinds professional installation child safety matters wallpaper bath boys color search country eco friendly girls great buys kitchen murals textures top sellers traditional wallpaper trends about american blinds commercial quotes email customer service email sales support exclusive email specials free samples payment options want to be notified about sales? sign up now for exclusive offers!
