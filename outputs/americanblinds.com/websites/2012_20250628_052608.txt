another easyup. small children and elderly people sometimes need this option even on smaller shades. for blinds, consider dividing them up into multiple blinds on a single headrail, or order multiple blinds and install them side-by-side. usually there are multiple windows within a single opening, so you should usually divide up the blinds to line up with the windows. when you do this, order one valance to span all the headrails to make it appear to be one single product. hard to reach windows: consider specifying extra long cords so you can open or close a product. some honeycomb shades and blinds can be made with a remote control. view recommended shades. front of house windows: it is common to want the front of your home to be as uniform as possible-just how uniform is up to you. most people just make sure that the front products are generally white. most honeycomb shades have white backings despite their colored inside-facing fabric. some aluminum miniblinds can be made as "duo-tones" which are white on the back. if a stained room faces front and you're using stained shutters or wood blinds, then you'll have to decide if it's acceptable visually. most customers think this is fine. the more symmetrical your home the more likely the products should be similar. people often use one product across the front; however, many also use one for the first floor and another for the second. it's your house, so whatever you feel is appropriate should be fine. windows with humidity: all quality products are water resistant. even good wood blinds are varnished and perform well under humid conditions. if your window gets direct water pressure (it's located in a shower) only a 100% vinyl product will perform well. view recommended products for humid rooms. bright outside light: to eliminate glare on a tv or computer monitor, or to prevent a bright security light from beaming in to your bedroom, use blinds with no route holes. one vendor calls this the de-light feature and is excellent. the de-light feature is optional on wood blinds, and comes standard on some aluminum blinds. blackout shades are excellent, too. high abuse areas: if you have rambunctious kids in your home, you should get the highest quality, sturdiest products. aluminum blinds come mainly in two gauges (8 and 6) -get the 8 gauge. we highly suggest blinds with spring-tempered aluminum that resist kinking better than all others. some miniblinds have clutch systems on their tilting mechanisms preventing over-tightening. there are some blinds which have dustshield, to repel dust from collecting on your blinds. faux wood blinds are an excellent choice because they are durable, resist abuse, and are easy to clean. view recommended products for high abuse areas. shop for blinds & shades cellular shades faux wood blinds mini blinds pleated shades roller shades roman shades sheer vertical blinds shutters (interior) vertical blinds window shadings wood blinds woven woods shop for wallpaper bath boys color search country eco friendly girls great buys kitchen murals textures top sellers traditional wallpaper trends resource center how to measure blinds how to install blinds do it yourself videos decorating tips customer testimonials featured articles professional installation about american blinds commercial quotes free samples payment options return policies exclusive email specials email sales support email customer service sign up now for exclusive offers! sign up copyright american blinds and wallpaper and more ©2010 **multiple discount codes cannot be combined. discounts cannot be applied to prior orders. click for details. contact us |  privacy & security  | legal notices  | disclaimers  |  affiliate program  | site map
