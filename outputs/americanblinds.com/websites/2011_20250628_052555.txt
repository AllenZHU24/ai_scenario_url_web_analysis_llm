coordinate, we recommend you do not begin installation until you have received all of the items. carefully inspect and examine your wallpaper before beginning your project. we also recommend you purchase an extra double roll or spool of the pattern you select. this allows extra product on hand, in the same run number and dye lot to ensure a perfect match, for future repairs.once you have received your wallpaper/border, you may want to keep a record of the run number/lot number on the packaged rolls. the vendor does not keep this information and if you need to order more paper, you will need this number for an exact match. to ensure our customers receive their wallpaper as quickly as possible, orders go directly to the manufacturer. we understand that there are instances where customers may need to cancel their order. though we cannot guarantee that the manufacturer will be able to cancel the order, we will attempt to accommodate our customer's request. once we receive confirmation that the order can be stopped from the manufacturer, we will refund your money less the processing fee. if you plan to use a wallpaper hanger, make sure all of the paper has arrived, as if you have ordered more than one type of paper it could arrive at different times. also, make sure the paper is not damaged or defective before the hanger arrives. we do not pay for wallpaper
