vault points are just our way of saying thank you! you earn one vault point for every dollar you spend with us, and you can use those points on future orders. it’s super easy to earn points, and 10 points = $1 to spend on more sparkle. vault points are one-time use and non-refundable, so find something you love! how can i use my vault points?

most credit cards are declined because the billing address you entered does not match the address your bank has on file. please be sure to double check this, and if that does not work, please send us an email at helpme@baublebar.com. promotions can i apply a promotion code to an order i already placed? unfortunately, we cannot retroactively apply promotion codes to any orders. are any items excluded from promotion codes? in general, promotion codes cannot be used on buried baubles, platinum buried baubles and gift cards. styles from the monogram shop and from the sale are often excluded from promotions, as well. if you have questions about the exclusions or fine print, please email helpme@baublebar.com. how are promotional discounts applied to orders? all promotion codes are applied to the order after vault points are deducted from the product subtotal. for example, if you used 100 points on an order and you have a 10% discount, the percentage discount will apply after the vault points are deducted from the product subtotal. helpshipping & handlingreturn policyinternational ordersfaq about our products baublebar: a user guide find the buried bauble gift cards our company our story join our team loyalty & rewards program invite friends, get $15 press help shipping & handling return policy international orders faq contact us get help get styled getting married?
