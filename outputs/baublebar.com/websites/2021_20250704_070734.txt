gold vermeil consists of sterling silver plated with gold. gold vermeil is not regular gold plating, rather, it is a much thicker coat of the metal. here at baublebar, we use the highest possible carat, 18k, for all of our gold vermeil pieces, with the exception of a few items that are made in 14k in order to increase longevity. each piece has a minimum plating of 2.5 microns to ensure durability and long-lasting style. gold filled: if you’re looking for a step up from gold vermeil, opt for gold filled. gold filled pieces feature brass with a thick layer of gold. this is not a plating, but rather a high heat bonding process that fuses the gold to the brass base. this ensures that your piece will last a lifetime. our gold filled styles are 5% (1/20th) of the total weight of the piece in gold as required by the federal trade commission. sterling silver: our sterling silver pieces are made of the industry standard makeup, 92.5% pure silver. the other 7.5% is copper to reduce risk of discoloration and improve surface quality. for our own sterling silver jewelry, we include a 1-2 mils rhodium plating to increase shine and prevent tarnishing. solid gold: we use 14k for all of our solid gold fine jewelry. as opposed to 18k solid gold pieces, 14k is a bit more durable and guarantees a piece that will last a lifetime. diamonds: every diamond found in our pieces is conflict-free and sourced ethically from suppliers who ensure socially responsible practices. carat weights range from .035 to .18, and clarity is always in si i1-2 range. product commitment quality guarantee if your piece is less than perfect upon arrival, we want to know! please send a photo to helpme@baublebar.com and our customer care team will get back to you with a solution. we’re here to help monday - friday, 9am - 6pm (est), and aim to respond within 4 business hours. hypoallergenic and nickel-free all of our jewelry is hypoallergenic and certified nickel-free, lead-free, cadmium-free, and phthalates-free. we test every single style to ensure they meet all of our rigorous standards. shipping through what carrier do your orders ship?
