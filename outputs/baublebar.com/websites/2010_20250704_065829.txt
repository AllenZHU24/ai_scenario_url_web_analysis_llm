about us dear baublebar shoppers, our story began six years ago in a conference room in new york city.  we became fast friends after bonding over our love for afternoon shopping breaks at saks fifth avenue, located a dangerous two blocks away from our demanding jobs in finance.  our friendship followed us to boston when we both left nyc to attend harvard business school.  in the midst of one of our shopping sprees, we had a sudden epiphany: despite owning piles of shoes, closets full of handbags and fistfuls of pashminas, fashion jewelry was the one accessory that had yet to capture meaningful space in our closets.  we began to wonder why… selection:  department stores had too much to sift through and boutiques had too little.  we wanted a go-to retailer where the selection was just right – enough to find the perfect piece without the search being so overwhelming. value: fashion jewelry comprised of richer materials, like semi-precious stone and gold-plating, were often priced the same as those made of lesser expensive materials, such as resin and base metal, and it just didn't add up.  we wished that pieces were priced based on quality and materials, so we could splurge on some trends and save on others, making it easy to always stay in style. it was then that we decided to create baublebar - a new concept in fashion jewelry retail. baublebar is your one-stop boutique for a curated selection of gorgeous fashion jewelry that truly allows you to experiment with trends and update your wardrobe guilt free.  everything sold by baublebar is sourced from designers that sell to high-end retailers, so you can expect the best in workmanship and style. this is only the beginning so stay tuned by signing up for our mailing list, finding us on facebook, and following us on twitter. off to find your next favorite purchase, amy jain & daniella yacobovsky co-founders return policy at baublebar we fully encourage experimenting with trends and style.  more importantly, we recognize that with experimentation comes the occasional regret, and the consequent need for a take-back.  maybe those earrings don’t match that dress as you had hoped, or you just can’t pull off that statement necklace like you had wanted to.  it’s ok, we’ve got you covered!
