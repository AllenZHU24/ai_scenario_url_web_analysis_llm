the most flattering petite fit not only addresses height, but proportions, too. petite sizing is designed for women 5'4" and under, but there are other factors that determine who should wear petites. if you have narrow shoulders or proportionately shorter arms, you may be able to wear petite tops. if your legs are proportionately shorter than your torso, you may want to try petite pants and skirts. petites: it’s a proportion, not a size.® christopher & banks petites offer the perfect fit for your size. we have proportionately adjusted the bust, waist and hip measurements - it's what makes you a petite and makes your sizing unique. we have taken some of our best christopher & banks styles and scaled them to petite sizing. we are happy to offer these wonderful choices to our petite customers and hope you find some beautiful additions for your wardrobe. missy us size us numeric size bust waist hip xs 0 31 27 36 2 32 28 37 s 4 33 29 38 6 34 30 39 m 8 36 31 40 10 37 32 41 l 12 38½ 33½ 42½ 14 40 35 44 xl 16 41½ 36½ 45½ 18 43 38 47 xxl 20 45 40 49 22 47 42 51 petite – under 5’4” us size us numeric size bust waist hip xsp 0p 31½ 26½ 35½ 2p 32½ 27½ 36½ sp 4p 33½ 28½ 37½ 6p 34½ 29½ 38½ mp 8p 35½ 30½ 39½ 10p 36½ 31½ 40½ lp 12p 38 33 42 14p 39½ 34½ 43½ xlp 16p 41 36 45 18p 42½ 37½ 46½ women us size us numeric size bust waist hip x 14w 41 36 43 1x 16w 43 38 45 18w 45 40 47 2x 20w 47 42 49 22w 49 44 51 3x 24w 51 46 53 26w 53 48 55 4x 28w 55 50 57 30w 57 52 59 5x 32w 59 54 61 34w 61 56 63 missy diane gilman please note that sizing and specifications are specific to the diane gilman collection. tops us size us numeric size bust waist hip xs 2 33 - 34 26 - 27 36 - 37 s 4 35 28 38 6 36 29 39 m 8 37 30 40 10 38 31 41 l 12 39½ 32½ 42½ 14 41 34 44 xl 16 42½ 35½ 45½ 18 44 37 47 bottoms us numeric size waist low hip 2 27 37 4 28 38 6 29 39 8 30 40 10 31 41 12 32½ 42½ 14 34 44 16 35½ 45½ 18 37 47 women diane gilman please note that sizing and specifications are specific to the diane gilman collection. tops us size us numeric size bust waist hip 1x 14w - 16w 43 - 46½ 36½ - 40 46½ - 50 2x 18w - 20w 47 - 50½ 40½ - 44 50½ - 54 3x 22w - 24w 51 - 54½ 44½ - 48 54½ - 58 4x 26w - 28w 55 - 58½ 48½ - 52 58½ - 62 bottoms us numeric size waist low hip 14w 36½ 47 16w 38½ 49 18w 40½ 51 20w 42½ 53 22w 44½ 55 24w 46½ 57 26w 48½ 59 28w 50½ 61 pant lengths inseam range* height range missy average short long 31” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” 28” – 29” under 5’4” 34” – 35” 5’9” and over petite average short 28” – 29” 5’ – 5’4” 25” – 26” under 5’ women average petite tall 31” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” 28” – 29” under 5’4” 34” – 35” 5’9” and over shapewear shapewear body shapers us size us numeric size m 6/8 l 10/12 1x 14/16 2x 18/20 3x 22/24 4x 26/28 shapewear bras us size bust size m 36 l 38 1x 40 2x 42 3x 44 4x 46 shoes us size inches 6 8.875 7 9.25 8 9.5 9 9.875 10 10.125 — meet blogger — beth djalali from style at a certain age learn more give the gift of thanks this season. donate in-store: find a store donate online: go to st. jude.com learn more sign-up for the latest news, exclusive offers, and special invitations to events ★ ★privacy policy sign-up ★privacy policy customer service track your order faq shipping returns live chat size chart product articles coupons contact us manage your credit card apply now pay bill online credit card benefits access your account friendship® rewards sign-up friendship® rewards benefits check points balance service our company for investors community affiliate program careers privacy policy terms of use security sitemap stay connected facebook pintrest instagram twitter youtube message x give $5 to get $5. donate $5 and instantly save $5 off your orderplus receive a $25 value coupon book. learn more $1 $10 $5 $25 no thanks, countinue to checkout limited time only! give $10, get a gift free st. jude ornament plus a $25 value coupon book with a $10 or higher donation while supplies last. thank you for your donation! thank you, countinue to checkout thank you for your donation of $1 thank you, countinue to checkout customer service: live chat or ph: 1-800-890-9601 ©2016 christopher & banks. all rights reserved. back-to-top back to top
