the most flattering petite fit not only addresses height, but proportions, too. petite sizing is designed for women 5'4" and under, but there are other factors that determine who should wear petites. if you have narrow shoulders or proportionately shorter arms, you may be able to wear petite tops. if your legs are proportionately shorter than your torso, you may want to try petite pants and skirts. petites: it’s a proportion, not a size.® christopher & banks petites offer the perfect fit for your size. we have proportionately adjusted the bust, waist and hip measurements - it's what makes you a petite and makes your sizing unique. we have taken some of our best christopher & banks styles and scaled them to petite sizing. we are happy to offer these wonderful choices to our petite customers and hope you find some beautiful additions for your wardrobe. missy us size us numeric size bust waist hip xs 0 31 27 36 2 32 28 37 s 4 33 29 38 6 34 30 39 m 8 36 31 40 10 37 32 41 l 12 38½ 33½ 42½ 14 40 35 44 xl 16 41½ 36½ 45½ 18 43 38 47 xxl 20 45 40 49 22 47 42 51 petite – under 5’4” us size us numeric size bust waist hip xsp 0p 31½ 26½ 35½ 2p 32½ 27½ 36½ sp 4p 33½ 28½ 37½ 6p 34½ 29½ 38½ mp 8p 35½ 30½ 39½ 10p 36½ 31½ 40½ lp 12p 38 33 42 14p 39½ 34½ 43½ xlp 16p 41 36 45 18p 42½ 37½ 46½ women us size us numeric size bust waist hip x 14w 41 36 43 1x 16w 43 38 45 18w 45 40 47 2x 20w 47 42 49 22w 49 44 51 3x 24w 51 46 53 26w 53 48 55 pant lengths inseam range* height range missy average 31” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” short 28” – 29” under 5’4” long 34” – 35” 5’9” and over petite average 28” – 29” 5’ – 5’4” short 25” – 26” under 5’ women average 31” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” petite 28” – 29” under 5’4” tall 34” – 35” 5’9” and over learn more learn more sign-up for the latest news, exclusive offers, and special invitations to events ★ ★privacy policy sign-up ★privacy policy customer service track your order gift card faq shipping returns live chat live chat (currently unavailable) size chart product articles coupons contact us give feedback accessibility policy empty manage your credit card empty apply now pay bill online credit card benefits access your account empty friendship® rewards empty sign-up friendship® rewards benefits check points balance service our company for investors community affiliate program careers privacy policy terms of use security sitemap stay connected facebook pintrest instagram twitter youtube customer service: live chat live chat (currently unavailable) or ph: 1-800-890-9601 ©2018 christopher & banks. all rights reserved. questions?
