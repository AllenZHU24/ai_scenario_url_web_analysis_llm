the most flattering petite fit not only addresses height, but proportions, too. petite sizing is designed for women 5'4" and under, but there are other factors that determine who should wear petites. if you have narrow shoulders or proportionately shorter arms, you may be able to wear petite tops. if your legs are proportionately shorter than your torso, you may want to try petite pants and skirts. it's a proportion, not a size.® christopher & banks offers the perfect fit for your size. we have proportionally adjusted the bust, waist, and hip measurements to different dimensions for missy, women and petite figures—it's what makes your sizing unique. christopher & banks creates clothing scaled to proportionately accurate sizing, rather than making the same dimensions larger or smaller. we are happy to offer this variety and hope you find some beautiful additions for your wardrobe that fit your body, just as it is. missy us size us numeric size bust waist hip xs 2 33 28 37 s 4 34 29 38 6 35 30 39 m 8 36 31 40 10 37 32 41 l 12 38½ 33½ 42½ 14 40 35 44 xl 16 41½ 36½ 45½ 18 43 38 47 petite – under 5’4” us size us numeric size bust waist hip p/s 4p 33½ 28½ 37½ 6p 34½ 29½ 38½ p/m 8p 35½ 30½ 39½ 10p 36½ 31½ 40½ p/l 12p 38 33 42 14p 39½ 34½ 43½ p/xl 16p 41 36 45 18p 42½ 37½ 46½ women us size us numeric size bust waist hip x 14w 41 36 43 1x 16w 43 38 45 18w 45 40 47 2x 20w 47 42 49 22w 49 44 51 3x 24w 51 46 53 26w 53 48 55 pant lengths inseam range* height range missy average 29 ½” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” short 26 ½” – 29” under 5’4” long 32 ½” – 35” 5’9” and over ankle 27” 5’4” - 5'8½” petite average 26 ½” – 29” 5’ – 5’4” ankle 24 ½” 5’ - 5’4” women average 29 ½” – 32” 5’4” – 5’8½” petite 26 ½” – 29” under 5’4” tall 32 ½” – 35” 5’9” and over ankle 27” 5’4” - 5'8½” *see style for exact inseam length. inseam length is dependent on leg shape and fabrication. straight-fit pant lengths straight-fit pants/jeans missy (4-16) us size us numeric size waist hip s 4 30½” 37½” 6 31½” 38½” m 8 32½” 39½” 10 33½” 40½” l 12 35” 42” 14 36½” 43½” xl 16 38” 45” 18 39½” 46½” straight-fit pants/jeans petite (4p-16p) us size us numeric size waist hip p/s 4p 30” 37” 6p 31” 38” p/m 8p 32” 39” 10p 33” 40” p/l 12p 34½” 41½” 14p 36” 43” p/xl 16p 37½” 44½” straight-fit pants/jeans women/plus (14w-24w) us size us numeric size waist hip x 14w 37½” 42½” 1x 16w 39½” 44½” 18w 41½” 46½” 2x 20w 43½” 48½” 22w 45½” 50½” 3x 24w 47½” 52½” 26w 49½” 54½” visit the c&b holiday gift shop learn more sign-up for the latest news, exclusive offers, and special invitations to events ★ ★ privacy policy sign-up ★ privacy policy customer service catalog track your order faq shipping returns live chat live chat (currently unavailable) size chart wish lists contact us accessibility policy service our company careers for investors privacy policy calif. residents: do not sell my personal info terms of use security sitemap stay connected facebook pintrest instagram twitter youtube customer service: chat now or ph: 1-800-890-9601 ©2022 christopher & banks. all rights reserved. × first name last name email phone number (optional) customer number (optional) subject please select cancel an order company information finding shophq on my tv help with placing an order order status product information promotion issue registration & account help returns/exchanges shipping information technical website issues other start chat questions?
