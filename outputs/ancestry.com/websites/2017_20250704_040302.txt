what are you? what are you?” growing up, lezlie had always encountered curiosity about her ethnicity from people she'd meet. “i probably got the question 3 to 4 times a week if i was asian or moroccan or something else,” she shared. so she jumped at the opportunity to find out through ancestrydna. and it turns out, lezlie's dna results did include african, european, and asian. “it was great because it helped confirm what i knew in my gut… with a little surprise.” so i traded in my lederhosen for a kilt.” growing up, kyle’s family was german, no doubt about it. he even grew up wearing lederhosen in a german dance troupe. but when kyle began building his family tree, he couldn’t actually find any german ancestors. “so i decided to have my dna tested, and the big surprise was we're not german at all,” he says. and soon enough, ancestry hints led him to generations of scottish ancestors. what surprises are hiding in your family tree? i thought i had married an italian?” marrying into eric's family, katherine was told of a rich italian family history—"my lineage was all vecchios and the zuccolis," according to eric. but when eric's ancestrydna results said he was only 16%, katherine took on the search and discovered an eastern european ancestor he never knew he had. katherine and eric used both ancestrydna and a family tree to solve their mystery—how will you begin your journey?
