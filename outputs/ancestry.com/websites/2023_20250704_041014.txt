answers to some common questions. get answers to some common questions. what membership packages are available? you can choose between three packages: u.s. discovery membership includes: access to all u.s. records on ancestry®. world explorer membership includes: access to all u.s. and international records on ancestry®. all access membership includes: access to all 40 billion records from around the world on ancestry®, and everything on fold3® and newspapers.com™. what payment methods do you accept? you can pay for your membership with visa, mastercard, american express, discover, apple pay or paypal. what do i need to get started? you don’t need any special skills to get started on ancestry®. you can start with just your name, and then add in any names, dates or places you know about your parents and grandparents into your family tree. if you can, speak to relatives and ask them about your ancestors. members of your family may remember important details or have family heirlooms, records or photos that can help you start building your family tree. how do i get started? an ancestry® membership gives you access to historical records that can help you build and expand your family tree. it's usually best to start your tree with yourself and work your way backward, adding any names, dates or places you know about your parents and grandparents into your family tree. your tree is the best way to store and organize the records you find. who can i find records for? the records you can view on ancestry® depend on the membership package that you choose e.g. you can only see the full international record collection if you subscribe to a world explorer or all access membership. you can discover and add records for family members and ancestors to your family tree. however, as privacy laws vary around the world, in some countries, such as the u.k., if there isn’t a confirmed date of death, records containing personally identifiable information are redacted or obscured until 100 years after the date of birth of an individual. this is to ensure we don’t share any personal information of living individuals. due to our privacy rules, you won’t be able to see living people in other ancestry® member trees, unless the owner of the tree shares. what languages will the records/transcriptions be available in? all records are transcribed in the language found in the original document. will i receive updates from ancestry? subscribing to ancestry® emails can help keep you informed about new records and features, product improvements, tips from expert genealogists, success stories, special promotions and more. will i be charged during my free trial? the membership you choose for the free trial will be the membership your trial turns into after two weeks. for this reason, we ask for a form of payment to set up a free trial. a small pre-authorization charge appears and disappears at the beginning of the trial to verify the method of payment. if you cancel your free trial during the two free weeks, your trial will end immediately, and you will not be charged. what is included in my free trial? free trials are available for each of the three ancestry® memberships available. during the trial period, you have complete access to all records and features available with that subscription. the subscription you choose for the free trial will be the subscription your trial turns into after two weeks. how do i cancel my free trial? cancel anytime at least two days before your renewal date by visiting the account settings section or by contacting us. is my family tree private? living people in your family tree are always hidden from other ancestry® members by default. you control all other privacy settings on your family tree. you can choose to make your family tree public, which allows other members to review your tree. having a public tree enables you to collaborate on researching shared ancestors with other ancestry® members. it’s easy
