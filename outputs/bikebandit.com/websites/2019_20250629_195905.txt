control emissions in an ever-increasingly eco-conscious world. while some bikers will always prefer carburetors, even they can’t deny that fuel injection has made the science of air/fuel ratios and bike performance an easier task, as well as one that is kinder to the environment. if you have an older bike that uses a carburetor, bikebandit.com has a motorcycle fuel injection conversion kit and more to help you take advantage of the benefits of fuel injection. one of the reasons you ride a motorcycle is to take advantage of the better gas mileage it delivers when compared to automobiles. but you’re leaving part of that benefit on the table if you’re riding a bike with a carburetor. a motorcycle efi conversion allows the fuel injector to adjust the air/fuel mixture continuously, delivering the best combination for ever-changing driving conditions and the greatest fuel efficiency at all times. fuel injection for vintage motorcycles and for bikes that are not-so-classic is here to stay.
