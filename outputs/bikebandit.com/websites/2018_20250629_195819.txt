helpful oem parts reviews 3 reviewed by motobob on october 16 k & n filter stopped the dust! – i replaced the original paper air filter in my kawasaki terex with a k & n because the original filter would pass fine dust into the intake tract. no more with the k & n filter, the dust is caught in the filter and no more fine dust gets in the intake tract. it also can go longer between cleaning and has quicker acceleration. love not having to spend $20 bucks for an original filter every time it needs a filter. thanks, k & n for a great filter! 5 stars. keep your machine road-ready whether you want to clear your head, explore the countryside, or trek across the country, your motorcycle or atv is always there for you. even though your machine is tough, it isn’t indestructible. to keep your machine ready for the road, track, or trail, never ignore old, damaged, or worn parts. instead, replace faulty components with strong, durable upgrades to get the most out of your motorcycle or atv. when you order from bikebandit.com, you know you are getting oem parts for your motorcycle or atv. with our huge selection, we are sure we have everything you need to dominate wherever you choose to ride. demand high-quality parts with both extreme and casual riding, motorcycle parts eventually fail. when something breaks on your machine, you know you can’t scrimp on quality. choose oem parts to be certain your bike is ready to tackle any riding challenge. with factory-grade parts, you ride with confidence. find the right manufacturer as an avid motorcyclist, you simply can’t outfit your bike with parts made for another machine. whether you drive a sport bike, cruiser, atv, or another type of machine, we have you covered. choose honda atv parts or polaris parts to keep your 4x4 controlling the trial. or, opt for kawasaki oem parts or yamaha oem parts to be sure your bike is ready to fly down the highway or around the track. take advantage of our great deals here at bikebandit.com, we work hard to be your one-stop resource for motorcycle and atv parts and accessories. we also understand you would rather be on your machine than looking for the best prices for the products you need to take your ride to the next level. therefore, we proudly feature our best price guarantee. with it, you know you won’t find a better deal anywhere else. if you do, we’ll gladly match it. to help you save even more, we also offer free shipping on orders over $99. shop oem by make & riding style bmw oem parts bmw street oem parts bmw cruiser oem parts bmw dual sport oem parts bmw dirt oem parts bmw scooter oem parts can am oem parts can am street oem parts can am atv oem parts can am utv oem parts honda oem parts honda street oem parts honda dual sport oem parts honda atv oem parts honda scooter oem parts honda cruiser oem parts honda dirt oem parts honda utv oem parts honda generator oem parts husqvarna oem parts husqvarna street oem parts husqvarna dual sport oem parts husqvarna dirt oem parts kawasaki oem parts kawasaki street oem parts kawasaki dual sport oem parts kawasaki atv oem parts kawasaki pwc oem parts kawasaki cruiser oem parts kawasaki dirt oem parts kawasaki utv oem parts kawasaki generator oem parts ktm oem parts ktm street oem parts ktm dual sport oem parts ktm dirt oem parts ktm atv oem parts polaris oem parts polaris street oem parts polaris atv oem parts polaris utv oem parts polaris pwc oem parts sea-doo oem parts sea-doo pwc oem parts suzuki oem parts suzuki street oem parts suzuki cruiser oem parts suzuki dual sport oem parts suzuki dirt oem parts suzuki atv oem parts suzuki utv oem parts suzuki scooter oem parts triumph oem parts triumph street oem parts triumph cruiser oem parts triumph dual sport oem parts yamaha oem parts yamaha street oem parts yamaha dual sport oem parts yamaha atv oem parts yamaha scooter oem parts yamaha snowmobile oem parts yamaha cruiser oem parts yamaha dirt oem parts yamaha utv oem parts yamaha pwc oem parts yamaha generator oem parts become a bikebandit insider!
