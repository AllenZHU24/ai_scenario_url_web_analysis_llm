yes (0) no (0) flag as inappropriate january 26, 2018 scott l purchased over 2 years ago was this review helpful? yes (0) no (0) flag as inappropriate would you recommend yes sweet hydraulic clutch the magura hymec clutch system works really great. my factory clutch cable was awful, it had a fair amount of resistance and was notchy, even after lubricating the clutch cable repeatedly (it basically needed to be replaced). i am so glad i invested in the hymec, it works fantastic. extremely light clutch pull, it makes shifting my tiger 800 xc buttery smooth and effortless. note the instructions provided were poor, the pictures were tiny and dark, and way too little info was provided for how to mount the slave cylinder (it varies greatly by bike). i stalked all the magura info and videos i could find online and finally learned enough to install it. took well over 2 hours to figure out and install, i could now remove and re-install it in 30 minutes or less. i would rate it 5 stars but for the poor directions. great product! was this review helpful?
