order as soon as possible! most orders will ship within 3-5 business days, though sometimes unexpected delays caused by a manufacturer can result in a delay. the bikebandit.com system will automatically notify you as soon as we are made aware of any delay in the fulfillment of your order. information concerning your order status may also be found by logging in to your account at bikebandit.com and clicking on view order history just below your login name on the left side of our homepage. shipping options / international shipping in the first step of the checkout process, we'll ask which shipping method you'd prefer. bikebandit.com offers a choice of two shipping methods for most orders: ground and express. for orders under $20.00 in value, we provide super-discounted ground shipping for a flat fee of just $6.95. for larger orders, our ground shipping charge is a flat $8.95. bikebandit.com charges a flat $27.95 fee for express shipping. orders shipped ground may be sent by ups or usps. orders sent express will be shipped using a premium service such as ups 2nd day service or usps priority mail. large or heavy orders may only be shipped ground. bikebandit.com may ask for authorization for additional shipping charges for oversized or heavy orders. international orders will be shipped by ups. all duties, taxes and brokerage fees are included in the order total. shipping to po boxes bikebandit.com is usually unable to ship to po boxes. many post offices will not accept larger parcels and will return such packages to the sender, a process that can take several weeks. if you provide a po box as your shipping address, the bikebandit.com customer service team will contact you for a complete street shipping address. if you are certain that your post office accepts larger parcels (we know that some of you regularly receive large packages at your po box), please let the customer service team know and we will be happy to ship your order to the po box address provided. order status / tracking my order bikebandit.com has developed the best online real-time order tracking system in the powersports industry! to view the status of any of your orders, just log in to www.bikebandit.com and select view order history from directly under your name on the left side of the screen. you will be able to see every order you have placed with bikebandit.com along with the status of each item ordered. there are six different status designations for each item you've ordered: pending – the item has been ordered from the manufacturer or supplier and we are awaiting confirmation that it is available. on order – the item is in transit from the manufacturer or supplier. shipped – bikebandit.com has already shipped the item to you! cross-shipped – the item is not available from the manufacturer or supplier’s main us warehouse but is in transit from an alternate warehouse. this will usually add 1-4 business days to our normal order fulfillment time. bikebandit.com will wait for cross-shipped items before shipping your order. backorder – the item is currently out of stock in all of the manufacturers’ us warehouses but is still in production and is therefor not considered to be discontinued. bikebandit.com will ship all non-backordered parts as soon as possible and will ship the backordered item - when it arrives from the manufacturer - by ground service at no additional charge. if the backordered item does not arrive within 25 days, it will be cancelled from your order. not available – the item is no longer in production and has been discontinued by the manufacturer. bikebandit.com isn't able to acquire discontinued parts! if your order has already been shipped, the view order history page will display the package tracking information from fedex or usps. this page will also show the amount billed to your credit or debit card. our customer service team will be happy to answer any specific questions you have regarding your order, but the view order history page is a great way to quickly check on order status and get tracking details. combining / adding items to my order unfortunately orders cannot be combined nor can items be added to an existing order. the bikebandit.com system automatically routes orders to our suppliers based on their previous performance. this means that two orders from the same customer placed seconds apart may actually be routed to and filled by two different suppliers. we cannot add parts into an existing order because bikebandit.com does not store credit card data online for security purposes. canceling an order if you need to cancel an order (or a part of an order), send an email to cancel@bikebandit.com. please be sure to provide us with the order id! bikebandit.com works extremely hard to fill orders in the shortest amount of time possible. orders for oem parts may be cancelled with no restocking fee within one hour of being placed. after one hour, cancelled orders for oem parts are subject to restocking fees of 20% of the merchandise value. orders for all other parts may be cancelled with no restocking fee provided the order hasn't already entered the shipping process! why does bikebandit.com charge restocking fees on cancelled oem parts orders? we return all cancelled oem parts to the manufacturer and in doing so face two charges: the cost to return the item to the manufacturer and a restocking fee charged to us by the manufacturer. bikebandit.com will cover this return shipping expense but we pass on a portion of the restocking fee charged to us by the manufacturer. customer service contacts we do our best to answer all the frequently asked questions in the topics outlined above. if your question hasn't been completely addressed, use the links below to contact our customer service department. live support (online chat help): email support (answered within 1 business day): bikebandit.com customer support dept
