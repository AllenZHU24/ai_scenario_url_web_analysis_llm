i have a ural sidecar rig. the tire size i'm interested in is 110/80-19 which is designated as a front tire. i would like to use this size tire for my rear drive wheel on my rig. i am wanting to do this to have a smaller wheel diameter than stock to up the engine rpm at highway speeds. i have read that the urals use two different size wheels. 18 and 19 inchs wheels. the 18 inch is able to go faster than the 19" due to higher engine rpm. mine is 19 inch and can barely hold 55 mph. i only want 60.can you tell me if using the front as a rear would be okay or not.thank you for your help. country3wheeler on nov 25, 2012 best answer: thank you for your question. it is not recommended to use a front tire on a rear tire application. the shape is completely different and can affect handling. in this case your bike is equipped with a side car, so the shape may not be as crucial. one thing to consider is, will the front tires have the load index to handle the weight of your rig? are parts readily available for the bike, it would be easier to replace a sprocket than a wheel. reply inaccurate staff staff on nov 27, 2012 hide answers add answer answer i have this question too (2) 0 best answer: thank you for your question. it is not recommended to use a front tire on a rear tire application. the shape is completely different and can affect handling. in this case your bike is equipped with a side car, so the shape may not be as crucial. one thing to consider is, will the front tires have the load index to handle the weight of your rig? are parts readily available for the bike, it would be easier to replace a sprocket than a wheel. reply inaccurate staff staff on nov 27, 2012 vote for the best answer above!
