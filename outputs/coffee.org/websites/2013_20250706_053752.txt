they are two very different drinks, even though they are often treated like one in the same. caffeine content one of the first differences that people consider between coffee or tea is the caffeine content. there is a general assumption that coffee has more caffeine than tea, and some people even think that green tea is caffeine free. well, it is true that a typical cup of brewed coffee will have more caffeine than tea but all teas do have some caffeine. one cup of coffee will have between 60 and 100mg of caffeine (depending on the roast) and a cup of black tea will have about 45mg. so the difference isn't that extreme. green tea has about half the caffeine as black, and white tea has even less. in coffee, lighter roasted coffee beans will produce a cup with the most caffeine because the roasting process cooks off some of the chemicals including caffeine. ironically, this is the opposite of what people think. a darker roast will have less caffeine per volume than a lighter roast. tea works the opposite way. the more processed it is (black), the more caffeine it will have because it has gotten more concentrated in the leaves. a significant difference between coffee and tea is the variety. though coffee beans can be roasted to different degrees, all coffee is generally the same and has a very common flavor. on the other hand, tea comes in more forms such as black, green, white or oolong. green tea tastes quite different from black tea, while there isn't an equivalent "green coffee". the effects of coffee and tea on your health are varied, and are still up for debate. the idea that coffee is bad for you (or good for you) seems to change every few years. even caffeine itself may have a few beneficial effects for your body, though most people do agree that excessive caffeine is not healthy. the one area where coffee and tea differ is in antioxidants. they are not that easy to explain, but antioxidants are chemicals that help your body fight aging and disease by "cleaning up" cellular damage caused by natural oxidation. green tea has more of them, because these chemicals are destroyed by the roasting and fermenting process that makes black tea. it's the antioxidants that make tea such a healthy drink, compared to coffee. some studies have shown that coffee many also have antioxidants but it's not a widely accepted notion. shop by shopping options brands b.w. coopers (8) bigelow (18) cruisin cool (13) crystal light (7) cup of colorado (4) fruitastic xs (4) higgins & burke (8) lipton (3) miss ellie's (48) organa tea (2) red diamond (4) tazo (10) timothy's (19) category tea realcups (8) tea bags (37) ice tea (20) tea concentrate (17) b.w. cooper's tea (10) tea pods (3) teas & drinks (97) loose leaf tea (36) product size 24 count (7) 48 count (7) 96 count (7) 1 oz (32) 1.75 oz (2) 2.5 oz (2) 3.5 oz (27) 9 oz (1) 1 lb bag (30) bag (1) bean (28) bottle (28) box (20) case (36) product type accessories (8) drink mix (8) filter packs (17) hot chocolate and cappuccino (2) k-cups (19) mini bottle (4) real cups (8) real fruit smoothy (13) slushies (4) supplies (1) tea (36) tea bags (39) tea concentrate (8) tea pods (3) weekly deals - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - latest testimonial magebuzz_testimonial_model_testimonial object ( [_eventprefix:protected] => core_abstract [_eventobject:protected] => object [_resourcename:protected] => testimonial/testimonial [_resource:protected] => [_resourcecollectionname:protected] => testimonial/testimonial_collection [_cachetag:protected] => [_datasaveallowed:protected] => 1 [_isobjectnew:protected] => [_data:protected] => array ( [testimonial_id] => 979 [name] => martha huntley [email] => [avatar_name] => [avatar_path] => [website] => [company] => [address] => [testimonial] => i had never tried city stream coffee before - ordered it just to try it, and loved it! i like all your varieties, and i like the variety. the order came promptly, beautifully packaged, in excellent condition, and even included a couple of complimentary raisin-oatmeal cookies. nice touch! i hope to be ordering often!
