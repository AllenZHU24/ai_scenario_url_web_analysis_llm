shipped within 24 hours from items in-stock at our arkansas warehouse. many times we ship your order the same day we receive it. orders requesting air delivery generally ship same-day when we receive your order by 12:00 noon central time. orders for whole bean coffees may be custom roasted-to-order. see our roasting & shipping cycle. how is shipping calculated & how much is my shipping? shipping rates are determined on the selected shipping speed and weight/size of your total order. to get an estimate of your shipping cost you can do the following: add all items to your cart. scroll to the bottom of the cart to find the shipping calculator like the image on the right. fill out the form on the cart page with your information and click calculate. delivery times & tracking your shipment for delivery times, click on the shipping map shown at the right. this map shows the total shipping days (via ground service) for your order to arrive – shipped from our arkansas warehouse to your front door. most all shipments come from our arkansas warehouse – except commercial beverage equipment which generally ships factory-direct from the manufacturer. all shipments – air & ground air shipments of multiple items when you order multiple items via air delivery, an additional shipping charge may apply to each item shipped (that's how ups and fedex charge us). we will let you know your total air shipping cost if it differs from the amount automatically calculated on our web site. weekends and holidays do not "count" as a shipping day example: your order ships on friday via next day air. it is scheduled for delivery the next business day, tuesday. your order does not move on saturday or sunday (the weekend), or on monday (the national holiday). it is delivered on tuesday, the next business day, right on schedule. the day your order ships does not "count" as a shipping day example: your 2nd day air order ships monday for scheduled delivery on wednesday, the 2nd business day. the day your order ships (monday) is not counted as a shipping day. example: your ground order ships on tuesday for scheduled delivery on the 3rd business day, friday. the day your order ships (tuesday) is not counted as a shipping day. economy shipping method (fedex smartpost) for many items, we offer an economy shipping method. if you select this shipping method, your order will be shipped via the least expensive method available, which is almost always fedex smartpost. smartpost is a special shipping method designed for smaller, lighter packages. it is intended to save you money when speed is not an issue for you. smartpost packages are carried from our location by fedex and deposited at a smartpost hub. at the hub, your package is handed over to the u.s. postal service for "final mile" delivery to your door (or po box). please note that if you have a po box, you should always use it. if not, you should use your complete street address, including business name or suite number (if applicable). please note that smartpost (unlike other shipping methods) do not have a guaranteed/predictable delivery date. smartpost packages are pooled together and move around the country based on carrier volume and logistics on their end. economy packages usually take between 6 and 10 business days to be delivered, but could be delivered several days sooner or later than that. if you would prefer your package to be delivered more quickly, consider upgrading to ground shipping. hawaii shipping method shipments to hawaii are shipped us priority mail. u.s. territories shipping
