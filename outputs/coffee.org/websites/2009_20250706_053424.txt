"in the morning you want a good cup of coffee to get you going and in a good mood to run out the door," she says. "the coffees i choose for miss ellie’s will definitely do that." then there was the business itself. see, miss ellie does not believe in ravaging the environment or misusing people. it is probably in the way she was brought up. raised to do well and do right, she wanted those principles reflected throughout the entire coffee.org company. she found the perfect way to do this, through coffeekids.org, an organization that helps coffee-farming families improve the quality of their lives. "i was a school teacher, and i just fell in love with kids," she says. "they’re so imaginative and curious and innocent. if i could have kids working in our business, i would. however, since i cannot, it is important for me to do my share in helping children have better lives. i wouldn’t be involved in any kind of business that didn’t look at a bigger picture than just the bottom line." "since i can’t get there and do it myself, this is the next best thing," miss ellie says. "this way i know that every pound of coffee we sell helps the effort." "this isn’t about just roasting a bunch of coffee and seeing who wants to buy it," miss ellie says. "i drink my product. i am my own best customer. i hate horrible coffee. i am not going to let anything get to my customers that i don’t absolutely love. my name’s on the bag, and where i come from, you have pride in your good name." ellie glidewell is a managing partner of coffee.org. she graduated from the university of arkansas, fort smith, and loved teaching school before deciding to have a coffee named after her. she is married to nick glidewell, whose family has operated glidewell distributing, a leading food-distribution business, since 1946. ellie and nick proudly live in fort smith, arkansas, the heart of the true south. sign up for email savings bookmark coffee.org | site feedback coffee | about us | contact us | privacy | terms of use | shipping informationfax order | site map | miss ellie story | testimonials | government | credit application | catalog
