i have been a customer for years and you never offer free shipping for tea orders under $100.00. my order is usually $65.00 to $75.00. a anne in ca now that paradise doesn't make decaf i really miss the decaf paradise ice tea - but since it has been discontinued - this is the next best option. the tea bags make nice strong tea. a awesomex love all day gourmet! all the adg flavors are awesome. i have a 3 gallon dispenser that i keep in the fridge that is always full of some kind of iced tea. i drink iced tea like its water and prefer it to be somewhat diluted. with paradise tropical brand i have to use 3 (1) oz bags per 3 gallons of tea, but adg i only need to use 2 because it tends to be a bit stronger. this is a good thing obviously because it's maximizing my tea dollar! the only somewhat negative comment i have is i wish each tea bag were individually packaged in cellophane like paradise tropical. 123 shop our favorite brands customer service customer service contact us about us shipping terms of service privacy policy coffee roasters popular pages popular pages government supplier hospitality articles fundraising ideas rewards & referrals how to grow your coffee business brewed knowledge coffee service affiliate express government orders promotional products capability statement coffee subscription gift subscriptions free trial product keep in touch sign up for our newsletter and be the first to know about coupons and special promotions. email join coffee.org © 2024 copyright to 1997 - 2023 (coffee.org). keurig® and k-cup® are registered trademarks of keurig inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of green mountain coffee roasters, inc. our brands are not affiliated with green mountain coffee roasters inc., or keurig inc. american express diners club discover mastercard paypal shop pay venmo visa
