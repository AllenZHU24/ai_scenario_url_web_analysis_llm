consider a single-serve brewing system that uses pods. for a larger family, get a machine that will make at least 8 cups at a time. besides all the various features, the basic machine is still the drip coffee maker though the pressurized single-serve systems are gaining in popularity. filters drip machines that use loose coffee will also need filters. they may seem insignificant, but they really are essential coffee supplies. a paper filter is easiest to use, but you will have to keep replacing them and they can give your coffee a papery taste. permanent gold filters are cleaner and won't change the taste of your coffee. they cost more, but will last you nearly forever. if you are using a pod-system for your brewing, you won't need any filters since they are built-in to the pods. choose a coffee brewer for yourself that is easiest to always have all the supplies on hand for it to function as it should. creamers and sweeteners: unless you drink your coffee black, you should always have the right "extras" on hand as part of your coffee supplies. most people add a little creamer and/or sweetener to their coffee, and both of these come in many forms. heavy cream is the richest but can add quite a load of extra calories to your coffee so many drinkers stick with milk (even soy milk for the vegans). powdered creamer is shelf-stable and lasts a very long time, so you can always keep a jar of it on hand for the day when you find yourself without any fresh milk. for sweeteners, you can go with sugar, honey or artificial sweetener. stevia is a nice herbal alternative with no calories. a squirt of flavored syrup is a decadent touch. your coffee condiment supplies can be as extensive as your taste!the coffee: last but certainly not least, the coffee itself needs as much attention as the machine you brew it in. pre-ground coffee is convenient, though it won't make you the best cup of coffee in the long run. try buying whole bean coffee, and grind it yourself right before you fill up your coffee maker. don't limit yourself to one style of coffee either. experiment and keep a few different varietals or roasts on hand so you'll have a few options to choose from. some days you might feel like a dark colombian roast, and other days you might prefer a lightly roasted hazelnut jamaican. bean grinder while bean grinders may seem like more of a luxury than true essential coffee supplies, many coffee lovers would disagree. being able to grind your roasted coffee beans right before brewing can make a world of difference in the flavor of your coffee. travel mug: unless you are able to sit at home to enjoy your coffee, you really should have a good-quality thermal mug. what is the sense of brewing up a fantastic cup of coffee if you have to rush and finish before you leave for work. have a mug handy. sign up for our email newsletter get the latest information about new products, special deals, news, top-rated items, promotions and more! about us company info miss ellie's story customer contests terms of use privacy policy trademarks, copywriters bbb accredited business customer service contact us my account/order status return policy shipping information miss ellie's shopping info gift certificates rewards program coffee articles affiliate program free demo product index category index bulk order form contact coffee.org inc. fort smith 5705 steep hill road, building 10712 fort smith, ar, 72916 1-800-344-2739 fax: 479-434-4645 about us company info miss ellie's story customer contests terms of use privacy policy trademarks, copywriters bbb accredited business customer service contact us my account/order status return policy shipping information miss ellie's shopping information gift certificates rewards program coffee articles affiliate program free demo product index category index bulk order form contact coffee.org inc. fort smith 5705 steep hill road, building 10712 fort smith, ar, 72916 1-800-344-2739 fax: 479-434-4645
