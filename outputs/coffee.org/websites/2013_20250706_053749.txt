history of coffee the history of the coffee bean and the beverage made from it is filled with legends and folklore. it is hard to decipher the truth from legend simply because there is no documentation that goes back that far and most of the stories are simply handed down through the ages. the most famous story in the history of the coffee bean is that they were discovered by goats. according to the ethiopian legend, kaldi, a goat herder noticed that his goats were jumping and dancing from one shrub to the next eating the berries. legend has it that he ate some and soon joined the goats in their dancing. nearby monks noticed this and picked the berries for himself and his brothers. the legend goes on to say that the monks received divine inspiration after eating the berries from the coffee bush. the story is probably stretched to make it more interesting and it is more likely that the herder noticed the goats had more energy after eating the berries and thus tried them. it would be years later in arabia that coffee began to be consumed as a beverage more closely resembling coffee today. muslims in arabia began roasting the coffee beans and drinking the beverage left behind in the water around 1000 a.d. this broth made from the coffee beans became a religious drink to keep the worshippers awake. over time, the energetic properties of the coffee broth moved over to secular life as well as religious life. as the monks travelled the coffee bean did as well and soon began to show up in other countries and cultures. eventually the coffee bean was showing up around the world and growing this exquisite plant became a race to grow the best coffee and create an empire from the coffee bean. brazil moved ahead in the game and by the 1800s was producing enough coffee to allow it to become a daily drink that even ordinary people could enjoy. originally coffee was made by boiling the coffee beans in water. the length of time the coffee beans boiled determined how strong or weak the coffee beverage would be when ready to drink. at some point it was determined that pulverizing the coffee bean released the flavor of the coffee more quickly than allowing the whole bean to simply steep for long periods of time. this led to grinding the beans and allowing them to brew the coffee. shop by shopping options brands brown gold (6) cafe bustelo (2) city steam (7)
