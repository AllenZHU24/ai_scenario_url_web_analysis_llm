before the checkout process: simply click on the "my account" link at the top of the page and follow the steps for new customers. after you've created the account, or if you already have an account/login, click the "my account" link at the top of this page to sign in. then, from your "my account" page, click the "add loyalty card" link to join/activate** the rewards program for your account. during the checkout process: on the "checkout" page simply fill out step 1 - billing info and enter a valid e-mail address. below a yellow box with "create an account" and "sign up for loyalty program" will be selected for you. next create a password and confirm it to complete the signup process. that's it, now you can start earning and redeeming your reward points, just remember to sign in each time you shop with us! how does it work? when you log in to your account every time you shop at coffee.org, we will put one point for every dollar you spend in your rewards account. once you accumulate at least 100 points you'll be awarded a $5.00 merchandise discount you can use on your next purchase. don't worry if your purchase is not $100, we'll simply track your points for you in our online account tool, which you can check any time by going to coffee.org and clicking "my account" at the top of the page. if you have enough points to generate multiple $5.00 discounts, you may use them together, up to the merchandise value of the purchase. please be aware that points are awarded 5 days after purchase, and are good for one year from the time they are awarded, and once expired will be considered forfeited. give me an example? say you spend $134.50 on a master case of all day gourmet coffee. we'll put 134.50 points in your account. the next time you make a purchase with us, you can use 100 points to create a $5.00 discount, and save the other 34.50 points in your account as you build up to 100 points again. just make sure you tell your customer service agent you'd like to use your reward or log in to your account to redeem your reward before you compete your order! how do i redeem points? online: first you will need to login to our web site using your coffee.org rewards account. you can do this before or during the checkout process. next continue through the checkout process to step 4 - payment info - where you will see a link labeled "reward". click the link to expand your available options and select the amount(s) you would like to apply to your puchase subtotal. review your order where you will see the reward dollars subtracted under "order discounts" from the subtotal price. to check your available reward points without going through the checkout process login to your account and under "loyalty card information" you will see all the following information; points balance, points until next reward, total reward rg, and reward available. on the phone/in person: even though your customer service agent can see your rewards program details, be sure to remind your customer service agent that you participate in the rewards program before you provide payment information. they will be able to check your rewards balance and notify you of rewards earned, at which point you can apply the rewards or save them for a later purchase. note that there is no minimum purchase amount to use a reward, and you may use all earned rewards, up to the price of the merchandise. rewards do not apply to shipping or tax. what if i have a return? we hold points for thirty days after purchase to allow for return. if a return is made, the points earned for that purchase (or amount of the return if it is not the entire purchase) will be deducted from your points balance. * shipping and tax not included ** the loyalty program accrues points on purchases made after joining. prior orders will not be applied to the points program. we reserve the right to modify or terminate the coffee rewards program or its benefits at anytime without notice. if we materially modify the benefits, we will notify you by e-mail and/or in our coffee rewards information page. loading... × sign up for our daily deals learn about our daily deals as soon as they are available and be the first to take advantage of great offers! about us company info sacred grounds coffee sacred grounds franchise miss ellie's story customer contests terms of use privacy policy trademarks, copywriters bbb accredited business customer service contact us my account/order status return policy shipping information miss ellie's shopping info gift certificates rewards program coffee articles affiliate program free demo product index category index bulk order form contact coffee.org inc. fort smith 5705 steep hill road, building 10712 fort smith, ar, 72916 1-800-508-6540 fax: 479-434-4645 about us company info sacred grounds coffee sacred grounds franchise miss ellie's story customer contests terms of use privacy policy trademarks, copywriters bbb accredited business customer service contact us my account/order status return policy shipping information miss ellie's shopping information gift certificates rewards program coffee articles affiliate program free demo product index category index bulk order form contact coffee.org inc. fort smith 5705 steep hill road, building 10712 fort smith, ar, 72916 1-800-508-6540 fax: 479-434-4645
