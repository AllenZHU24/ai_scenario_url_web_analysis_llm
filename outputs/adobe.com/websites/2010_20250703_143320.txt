section might look a bit scary and so we want to point out a few things. this section only applies to those portions of our sites, such as user forums, where we intend for users to share content freely with adobe and with each other. it does not apply to all of the content that you share, contribute or post to our sites. for example, it does not apply to content hosted by cs live online services, photoshop.com or acrobat.com. for services like those, we will provide customized license grants that are consistent with the spirit and intent of those services and that are appropriate for the kinds of content we expect you to share within them. (we say this more formally below.) so we encourage you to be selective when deciding which content to contribute under this license and we want you to be sure that you are comfortable granting the rights in this section when it comes to that content. a. adobe does not claim ownership of your content. however, except as provided in section 8(b), you grant adobe a worldwide (because the internet is global), royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display your content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate your content into other materials or works in any format or medium now known or later developed. b. the terms of section 8(a) shall not apply to your content: i. when specifically agreed that section 8(a) shall not apply in any additional terms that may accompany certain services (such as those provided with cs live online services, photoshop.com and acrobat.com); or ii. when your content is made available through services that are intended for private communication or which allow you to limit public access or use to your content and you do in fact limit public access or use. in the case of your content covered by section 8(b)(i), you grant adobe only those rights set forth in such additional terms. in the case of your content covered by section 8(b)(ii), you grant adobe a worldwide (because the internet is global), royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable, and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, publish and translate your content solely for the purpose of enabling your use of the service. you may revoke this license and terminate adobe’s rights at any time by removing your content from the service; provided that you agree that adobe may retain and use copies of your content for archival purposes and pursuant to section 7 (investigations), above. 9. feedback. you have no obligation to provide adobe with ideas, suggestions, documentations and/or proposals (“feedback”). however, if you submit feedback to adobe, while you retain ownership in such feedback, you hereby grant adobe a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, unlimited license under all of your intellectual property rights to use and otherwise exploit your feedback for any purpose throughout the universe. further, by submitting feedback, you represent and warrant that (i) your feedback does not contain the confidential or proprietary information of you or of third parties; (ii) adobe is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the feedback; (iii) adobe may have something similar to the feedback already under consideration or in development; and (iv) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from adobe for the feedback under any circumstances. 10. right to derive revenue/advertisements. except for your content subject to section 8(b) above, you agree that adobe may derive revenue and/or other remuneration from your content that you make available via the

connection with your content, and you agree that you are not entitled to any compensation for any such advertisements. the manner, mode and extent of advertising or other revenue generating models pursued by adobe on or in conjunction with the services and/or your content are subject to change without specific notice to you. 11. links to third party sites. the services and materials may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the services (“linked sites”). the linked sites are provided by adobe to you as a convenience and the inclusion of the links does not imply any endorsement by adobe of any linked site. adobe has no control of the linked sites and you agree that adobe is not responsible for the availability or contents of any linked site (including any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such linked site), any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to a linked site. 12. modifications to services and materials. adobe may at any time and from time to time modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the services or materials, or any portion thereof, with or without notice. you agree that

termination of your account (and accompanying deletion of your account information), or access to the services and materials, including your content. f. upon expiration or termination of the terms, you shall promptly discontinue use of the services and materials. however, any perpetual licenses you have granted, any of your indemnification obligations hereunder, any of adobe’s disclaimers or limitations of damages of liabilities hereunder and sections 2, 3, 6(b-d), 7, 9-13, 14, 16, 19, 20 and 21 will survive any termination or expiration of the terms. 14. disclaimer of warranties. you expressly understand and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: a. the site, services and materials are provided by adobe “as is,” without warranty of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. without limiting the foregoing, adobe makes no warranty that (i) the site, services or materials will meet your requirements or will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free; (ii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the site, services or materials will be effective, accurate or reliable; (iii) the quality of the site, services or materials will meet your expectations; or that (iv) any errors or defects in the site,

control, endorse or accept responsibility for any materials or services offered by third parties accessible through linked sites. adobe makes no representations or warranties whatsoever about, and shall not be liable for, any such third parties, their materials or services. any dealings that you may have with such third parties are at your own risk. d. managers, hosts, participants, moderators and other third parties are not authorized adobe spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of adobe. to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, adobe will have no liability related to user content arising under intellectual property rights, libel, privacy, publicity, obscenity or other laws. adobe also disclaims all liability with respect to the misuse, loss, modification or unavailability of any user content. e. adobe will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account or account information in connection with the site or any services or materials, either with or without your knowledge. f. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, the limitation or exclusion of implied warranties, or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. 15. international users. a. the services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and materials that are not available in your country. these references do not imply that adobe intends to announce such services or materials in your country. b. these services are controlled, operated and administered by adobe systems incorporated from its offices in the united states of america. adobe makes no representation that the

advised of the possibility of such damages, or based on any theory of liability, including breach of contract or warranty, negligence or other tortious action, or any other claim arising out of or in connection with your use of or access to the site, services or materials. nothing in the terms shall limit or exclude adobe’s liability for gross negligence or intentional misconduct of adobe or its

and notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. c. the limitations and exclusions in this section 16 apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in your jurisdiction. some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or punitive damages. accordingly, the limitations and exclusions set forth above may

access to the allegedly infringing content, terminating the accounts of repeat infringers, and/or making good-faith attempts to contact the user who posted the content at issue so that he may, where appropriate, make a counter-notification. b. if you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is hosted on the services, on web sites linked to or from the services, or in connection with the services or materials, please provide, pursuant to the dmca, written notification via regular mail or via fax (not via e-mail or phone) of claimed copyright infringement to adobe’s copyright agent (contact information below), which must contain all of the following elements: i. a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest that is alleged to have been infringed; ii. a description of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim have been infringed and

by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. before you file such a notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the “fair use” doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. if you are unsure whether a use of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. in addition, you may wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at www.chillingeffects.org. c. if you believe access to your content was disabled or removed by adobe as a result of an improper

which must contain all of the following elements: i. a physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; ii. identification of the material that was removed from the services and the location of the service on which the material appeared before it was removed; iii. a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of

and v. a statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the federal district court for the district where you reside (or of santa clara county, california if you reside outside of the united sates) and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under dmca subsection (c)(1)(c) or an agent of such person. before you file such a counter-notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of the copyrighted material at issue is infringing, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees in the event that a court determines your counter-notification misrepresented that the material was removed by mistake. if you are unsure whether use of the material at issue constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. in addition, you may wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at www.chillingeffects.org. d. adobe’s copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached

agent should be contacted only if you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and that such infringement is occurring on the services or on
