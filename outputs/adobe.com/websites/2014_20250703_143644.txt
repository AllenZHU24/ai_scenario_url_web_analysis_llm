no, the desktop applications in creative cloud, such as photoshop and illustrator, are installed directly on your computer, so you don't need an ongoing internet connection to use them. an internet connection is required the first time you install and license your apps, but you can use the apps in offline mode with a valid software license. the desktop apps will attempt to validate your software licenses every 30 days. for annual members, you can use the apps for up to 99 days in offline mode. month-to-month members can use the software for up to 30 days in offline mode. am i required to store my files in the cloud? no, your files remain on your local hard drive. you can also choose to take advantage of the ability to synchronize your local files with your creative cloud storage. even if you choose to sync your files to creative cloud, you will retain a local copy of your files. can i use the software i download from creative cloud on multiple computers? yes, you can install and activate creative cloud desktop applications on two computers, regardless of operating system, for use by the individual associated with the membership. see the product license agreements page for more information. what happens to my files in the cloud if i cancel or downgrade my membership? your cc files are stored on your desktop as well as on the cc servers. if you cancel or downgrade your paid membership, you will still have access to all of the files in the creative cloud folder on your computer and via the creative cloud website. your account will be downgraded to a free membership, which includes 2gb of storage. if you're using more than 2gb of storage, you will not be able to sync files until the amount of online disk space used in your account drops below your allotted amount. if you are over your quota, you have 90 days to reduce your online usage or you may lose access to some or all of your files through the creative cloud website, although you'll still have the files on your desktop. can i purchase a single desktop application membership, such as photoshop? yes, we offer a single-app membership for most of our products. this plan gives you access to one desktop app of your choice, plus updates and upgrades the moment they are released, 20gb of online storage, a customized online portfolio on your own url with behance prosite, and integration with behance. you also get access to the new creative cloud desktop app so you can keep track of your creative world in a single activity stream, and the ability to sync your settings, fonts, and colors (in select apps, with more to come soon). find out more on the creative cloud plans page. can i prepay for my creative cloud membership? yes, you can prepay for one year for a creative cloud complete individual membership or a student and teacher edition by purchasing on adobe.com. this gives you the same price as purchasing an annual plan, but you pay up front instead of monthly. your credit card will automatically be charged for each subsequent year on the anniversary date of your membership. you cannot prepay for a creative cloud for teams membership. you can also prepay for one year of membership when you purchase through a retailer or etailer. this gives you the same price as purchasing an annual plan directly from adobe, but you pay up front instead of monthly. in which countries can i purchase a creative cloud membership?
