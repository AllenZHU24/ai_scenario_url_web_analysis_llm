does that slow the process down? when you design your custom labels using one of our label wizard templates, we will provide an online proof of the design. you design your labels online and the proof is instantaneous. for uploaded designs, we typically will also provide you a proof. as long you quickly review the proof for errors, graphics, your custom label order will not be delayed. top peter can i add checkboxes to my tag design? yes, just give us a note when you place the order. some customers just show where they want a check box by typing two brackets (for example "[_]"). we offer free design service for your custom tag design, so you can always just fax us a sketch. top maureenframingham, ma what are the different parts [or layers] to a label? are there special terms for each part? custom labels, typically, have the following parts: â¢ lamination. this is top layer and optional. lamination adds to the cost of a label and is generally only used when the application requires special durability. this lamination (sometimes called an âoverlaminationâ) is clear and typically made from clear polyester, acrylic or polypropylene. in most cases, the lamination is glossy and the lamination is not writable. â¢ base material. this is the main label component (and is often called the custom labelâs âface stockâ). paper is most common, but other base materials include vinyl, paper, polypropylene and polyester. â¢ adhesive. the next layer is the adhesive layer. common adhesives are either solvent-based (more costly and, generally, better performing) or water-based (more affordable). the range of adhesive choices can quickly become rather daunting â so please call up our labellab experts if you want to learn more. â¢ liner. the bottom layer is [most often] a throw-away paper liner. the liner has a ârelease coatâ on one side that allows the liner to be removed from the adhesive easily. top asset tags christopherbrooklyn park, mn i do not see an asset tag template that i want. can you create one for me? our programmers can add an asset tag template just for you. we can place your asset tag template under the my designs area. top triciasterling, va are your asset tags semi-permanent? we want to use asset tags to label our computers. can i remove the labels later? yes, having semi-permanent asset labels for computers and laptops is a great idea. you may want to sell your computers or apply a new asset tag. in this application, we recommend our alumiguardâ¢ asset tags. while permanent and very difficult to remove by a casual user, these asset tags can be removed with the proper tools. it is kind of like shucking an oyster! use a knife and pry underneath the asset tag. the metal asset tag should come off. any residual adhesive from your asset tag can be removed with an adhesive remover. top banners robertnew york, ny how big should our banner be? and can i have it printed on both sides? to answer you second question first, because it is so simple, the answer is yes. the only difference will be in the material we print it on â we will use a more opaque white, because it will provide better color visibility on both sides of the banner. another option is to put two banners back-to-back. we will even sew them together for you if you would like! just let us know. the advantage of the back-to-back method is that you get the less opaque white material, and you could separate the two sides if you ever felt like it. as far as size goes, the size of the text is much more important than the size of the banner. see the size chart for text visibility. but a general ârule of thumbâ is that every inch of text can be seen 25 feet away. in short, your banner size will depend mostly on how much text you want to have on it. another often overlooked but critical factor in determining visibility is the color contrast. make sure that text stands out from the background, and it will be much easier to read. letter sizeviewing distance1"40 ft.1.25"55 ft.1.5"65 ft.2"85 ft.2.5"115 ft.3"135 ft.4"150 ft.6"200 ft.letter sizeviewing distance8"350 ft.9"400 ft.10"450 ft.12"525 ft.15"630 ft.18"750 ft.24"1,000 ft.30"1,250 ft. top braille / engraved signs howardcross keys, md how small can the letters be for a braille sign? must we use capital letters? the characters must be in capital letters. here is an excerpt from the ada rules (section 4.30.4 ): letters and numerals shall be raised 1/32 in, upper case, sans serif or simple serif type and shall be accompanied with grade 2 braille. raised characters shall be at least 5/8 in (16 mm) high, but no higher than 2 in (50 mm). pictograms shall be accompanied by the equivalent verbal description placed directly below the pictogram. the border dimension of the pictogram shall be 6 in (152 mm) minimum in height. top judysan jose, ca what is california braille? is all grade 2 braille suitable for california? california braille is a spacing and dot height standard which is different from the library of congress standard braille spacing. it has nothing to do with translation or meaning, like the distinction between contracted (grade 2) versus standard (grade 1) braille. all signs are written in grade 2 braille. in california, grade 2 braille specifications for spacing and height were modified specifically for signs. designed by a leading expert (who is, in fact, blind), the california spacing was calculated to be easier to read. beginners and elderly people, who have less training in braille or less sensitive fingers, could still read the simple text on signs (such as "male" or "exit" or "203") and find the right door. the california braille standard is legal in 49 other states too. there are no federal regulations on spacing and dot height in conflict with the california standard. all of our ada signs are made with california braille, and we strongly recommend using this standard for your signs. top evolis printers haley briggsyork beach, me what is the biggest issue to consider when choosing a printer? there are many issues to consider before you choose a printer, and the most important is knowing exactly how you'll be using your printer. is it for a school or university? is it for a secure organization? is it for one-at-a-time company ids? all of our evolis printers are designed for particular needs. our securion model, for example, is specially designed for secure laminated id printing, ideal for large, high-security facilities that may require unique holograms or special card protection. the quantum is built for high-speed bulk printing, which is great for a large-scale organization that can benefit from fast, simple id card prints. if you are a smaller organization, our best-selling pebble4 is a user-friendly option for high-quality single-sided prints. take a look at our specs for more information, and consider exactly what you want out of your id card printer. top sally knollportland, or how do evolis genuine ribbons benefit my evolis printer? why shouldn't i buy other card printer ribbons? there is good reason why we recommend evolis genuine ribbons for your evolis printer. not only are our ribbons designed especially for particular evolis models, but every ribbon is quality-tested before shipping, so you know you aren't just getting a good printer ribbon or laminate, you're getting the best. we also offer the widest range of hologram, blackwax and scratch-off ribbons, as well as patches and laminates for all of your printing needs. top exit signs shelly couturewilmette, il should i install green or red exit signs for my establishment? does it matter? these color choices are based on building codes that vary state-by-state. most u.s. states require the color red; however, parts of california, oregon, washington state, colorado and international codes require green signage. we offer both options to accommodate the needs of your state. take a look at our state-by-state information, and call your local fire marshal for a personal, local recommendation. top pamela smartconcord, nh do these exit sign comply with nfpa life safety code? do they have to be ul924 qualified, too? nfpa 101 (life safety code) compliance involves not only the type of sign, but the way it is installed and its precise location. all of our exit signs will already have the ul 924 seal on it, which is determined at the point of manufacture. nfpa-recommended graphic symbols, such as the running man graphic, are helpful additions to your ul924 signage. however, nfpa regulations are merely recommendations, and it is up to your fire marshal to enforce them. while nfpa 101-compliant signs are not required, they are widely and increasingly used across the country to communicate vital, universal instructions. we offer a number of glowing and non-glowing graphic signs that reach across language barriers, provide vital instructions and save time in an emergency situations. top sarah peterschicago, il is it true that my exit signs have to be wired on their own, individual circuits? i am guessing that will be costly. generally, yes, this is true. and, as you have guessed, this could mean some serious electrical work. for this reason, we see many building owners, when faced with various retrofit options are now buying photoluminescent signs. they require no wiring. top building superintendentnew york, ny do photoluminescent signs require 24 hour lighting for activation? doesn't that add to their costs? photoluminescent signs do not require 24-hour lighting, but state codes requires that lights be on at all times when the building is occupied. the signs themselves only require a few minutes of light exposure to operate in darkness. since you should already have your lights on during operating hours, this should not add to the total cost of ownership. top fire extinguisher inspection tags elainecolumbia, sc what needs to be included for the yearly agency fire extinguisher maintenance records? the maintenance recordkeeping should indicate more than just the service technician's name. see nfpa 10: "each fire extinguisher shall have a tag or label securely attached that indicates the month and year the maintenance was performed, and that identifies the person performing the work, and identifies the name of the agency performing the work." our custom fire extinguisher service tags also ask you to define a permit number. top brendendaisy, tn what do we need to inspect, during our monthly inspections? first, note that the monthly interval may be adjusted, "... extinguishers shall be manually inspected at a minimum of 30-day intervals or electronically monitored. fire extinguishers shall be inspected at more frequent intervals when circumstances require." [nfpa 10] the particular inspection information is often the following: [nfpa 10] (1) location in designated place (2) no obstruction to access or visibility (3) pressure gauge reading or indicator in the operable range or position. (4) fullness determined by weighing or hefting for self-expelling type extinguishers, cartridge operated extinguishers and pump tanks. (5) for wheeled extinguishers, the condition of tires, wheels, carriage, hose and nozzle shall also be checked. (6) for non-rechargeable extinguishers using push-to-test pressure indicators, test the indicator. top labels mikecarthage, mo are there any industry standard color-codes for quality labels? let's go back in time a bit. during the 80's, the color coding was rather straight-forward. calibration legends were in green; "rejected" used red; and, various inventory and sample labels used black. over the last ten years, however, these color meanings have eroded. we now sell calibration labels in 12 different colors. each month, for example, may have a different color-code for their calibration labels. more and more calibration labels are printed locally, at the users' own laser or ink jet printers. as such, colors have lost some of their original meanings and "industry standards" (at least regarding colors) are far more flexible. top mattelk river, mn i need a special shape for our custom labels. can you help out? we have several hundred label dies and many of these are not listed on our custom label quoters or wizards. if your special shape, however, does not match a die within our library, we then have two choices. in one option, we will just digitally cut your labels. this eliminates the cost of a label die. a label die may cost from $100 to $500, depending upon complexity and label type. the second option is to order a special die for your shape. please contact us and, together, we can determine the best option. top kimbrooklyn, ny i need help with designing a custom label. who can i call? call us up at 800-952-1457 and follow the prompts for customer service, we would be delighted to help you through the process of designing your custom label. we always invite your suggestions on how to make our custom label programs better. top daniel how is an rtk label different from the msds? note that the hazard communication standard is performance-oriented standard. as a result, you will not find specifications on the exact design for our right-to-know label (or even your msds). thus, labels and msds' follow many different formats and there can be no side-by-side comparison made between the information placed on the msds versus a label. to gain more insight, however, review the following excerpt from a july 25, 1991 letter from patricia k. clark, director, directorate of compliance programs at osha:"a material safety data sheet is not an "appropriate hazard warning"; the purpose of a label under the hcs is to serve as an immediate visual warning of the hazards associated with the chemical. the identity of the chemical leads to the more detailed information on the msds, but the hazard warning gives immediate information to employees working with the substance about the hazards associated with exposure." of course, an entire msds cannot fit onto your rtk label. vital information can be lost in the clutter of a badly organized label. rtk labels should make searching through the msds easier. a label is, a just a single component of your hazardous communication system. no doubt, it is the tangible evidence of a rtk system that spans not only the chemical database, your msds's, emergency response protocols and protective equipment and handling training. for many of the comprehensive label designs that we offer in our custom rtk label section, each area of a label links to a particular section of the 16-part msds. by creating a way to connect the label and the msds, and adding an msds reference to the label, the msds becomes less intimidating. top joe should rtk labels cover the worst case scenario? rtk labels are not written to cover every exposure situation. instead, they are made for the worst-case situations. many times that safety officer can decide to make the ppe requirements more flexible when a substance is handled in small enough quantities that they do not present any danger. here are a few examples: â¢ in situations when small quantities are used, a lab coat or apron is adequate enough to shield the body from contamination. however, many labels still have the full body suit symbol and are written for the worst-case exposure situations as a precaution. full body suits are generally used to protect one from liquid a corrosives as well as other liquids and solids that can potentially harm the host human, and gases which have the ability to invade the body through absorption or form corrosive mixtures with moisture. â¢ it is recommended that gloves be worn at all times when handling chemicals. this is a principle rule when managing with various gases. many gases, when placed under extreme pressure or very low temperatures turn into liquids. should these compressed gases be released and make contact with a human, frostbite will likely occur. gloves are greatly suggested for that reason, as well as to stop one from touching their eyes while chemicals still reside on their hands. top lockout tags brian do you have lockout tags that show a photograph of the electrician? yes, we have several designs that allow you to add a photo to your lockout tag. adding your photo to your tags is a terrific idea and increasingly popular. with the cost of digital camera dropping it is very easy to create and then print a small photo. many electrical departments find that personalized lock-out tags not only help you find someone, especially when you have so many contractors on site, but help convey the singular immediacy of the electrical hazard. i have even seen examples of electrical workers using pictures of their own children. for example, a tag had this type of photo and the message, "my dad's life is on the line. do not operate!"). top lee i see that many tags come with ties or wires. can't we just use strings on the lockout tags? most of our tags use plastic tie wraps. in general, we do not recommend strings. for a bit of background, see the following letter from john miles, directorate of compliance programs at osha: [excerpt only] "specifically you requested clarification on the possible use of a cotton-rayon cord of more than 60 pounds (13.49 newtons) breaking strength or a nylon cord of more than 100 pounds (22.48 newtons) breaking strength for attachment of tagout devices to energy isolating devices for the purpose of complying with the tagout requirement at 1910.147(c)(5)(ii)(c)(1). "by 1910.147(c)(5)(ii)(c)(1), the employer is required to provide a means of tagout device attachment having the general design and basic characteristics of being at least equivalent to a one-piece, all environment-tolerant nylon cable tie. the lockout/tagout standard uses performance language in imposing the above requirement. as such, an employer must be prepared to demonstrate equivalency to the osha compliance safety and health officer on inspection of his or her worksite. "in your letter you provided a sample tag with samples of the cords described above. the cords, alone, would not meet the following means of attachment requirements in 1910.147(c)(5)(ii)(c)(1). tagout device attachment means shall be of a non-reversible type, self-locking and non-releasable with a minimum unlocking strength of no less than 50 pounds (11.14 newtons). neither the cords nor the tag appear to be all environment-tolerant, that is, if wet, neither would hold up." top mats lonnie schwalmhattiesburg, ms why does one mat hold more water than another? different mats hold water for two primary reasons: the ridge depth of the mat pattern and the pile height of the fabric material. the ridge depth allows water and soil to settle below the shoe print and keeping dirt and moisture away from your floor. the height of the material that is affixed to the mat allows a mat to hold more water. the longer the pile and the deeper the ridge depth, the more the floor mat will hold. the waterhogâ¢ series boasts deep ridges and pile height to hold more water and dirt than the competition. top jessie cottoneeugene, or how color-fast are your custom logo mats? do they fade in the sun? our custom logo mats are made from long-wearing, static-dissipative nylon and should only be used indoor or under well covered outdoor areas. since we use a detailed, custom printing process, the vibrant colors of your custom logo are best preserved in a controlled environment. top darryl addariodouglas, wy how are your mats shipped to me? how much are shipping costs? all of our custom mats, safety mats, and other varieties are shipped using ups ground shipping. charges can vary by the size and weight of the mat. you will be shown your shipping charges at the time of your mat purchase. top kurt cedanobelen, nm are your mats imported? where are they made? our mats are all manufactured here in the united states and are backed with a 100% satisfaction warranty. top glenfielding, ut my old mat seems to creep along the floor. we are endlessly straightening them out. how can we avoid this problem? use the gripper backing for mats that are placed on hard surfaces. the gripper backing provides extra surface area for the mat to rest on, providing better protection from mat slippage. on carpeted surfaces, choose an underlayment depending on your type of carpet. all interior and entrance mats have this option. top parking permits joe rehmermissoula, mn it's important that my permits can be seen from a distance. are there parking permits that are compact, but are easily visible? yes! our big number parking permits feature extra-large numbers and lettering that can be seen from security vehicles and more! also, our brightly colored permits grab attention. with a bold color and large text, we give you the best combination of compact-sized parking permits and highly visible letters and numbers. there are no extra charges to add numbers to your parking permits, and all of the numbering is consecutive and unique, so you'll never have to worry about duplicates. we also offer permits with glow-in-the-dark numbering for even better nighttime visibility. at night, the date of the permit glows brightly and acts as a validating watermark for the parking permit tag. top candyhapland, mo can anybody order handicapped permits and ada parking permits? no. our customer service personnel will be happy to give you more information about obtaining authenticated handicapped parking permits. these permits are not sold to individuals. if you are legally permitted to have this restricted permit, contact us for more information and we will help you get everything you need. for critical applications, it is best to design custom handicapped permits or to control your handicapped parking with unique permit numbers that are easy to trace by your organization. top joshuarocky mount, va why do some of your parking permit tags have a hole at the top? this hole can be used for suction cups â which can be ordered separately. the suction cups are a good option when a car has not interior (rearview) mirror. certain vans, for example, do not have a rearview mirror. top nickfaiburn, ga can i add [our company's name] to your parking tickets? yes, this is very easy. just give us the information that you want and we can produce a proof for your approval. also ask about our parking violation manila and ncr tags. these two-part tags can also be customized with your name. top billhunting park, pa we have a special color. can you match it? many of our customers ask for a specific color. specify a pms number or send us a color chip to match. for most materials, there is no extra charge for a special color match â but we will confirm this with you prior to printing. top restroom signs robertnew york, ny i want to put a sign on my men's restroom. there is a ramp leading from the door down to the floor of the bathroom, which is about 2 feet lower. should i use the wheelchair graphic in conjunction with a "ramp" graphic, or does it have to be by itself in order to display accessibility and comply with the standards? you can use the wheelchair graphic in conjunction with a ramp graphic. in fact, we think that it is quite intuitive to do so when it is appropriate. but just remember - use good judgment when deciding what signs to install. we only recommend installing a "wedge" ramp graphic below the wheelchair pictogram when there is actually a ramp in that area. but, there is no regulation about this except that accessible restrooms must display the wheelchair pictogram. top davidkent, ct i have been looking at the restroom signs at the mall where i shop, and they have a different wheelchair pictogram than the signs at my gym. are there different symbols which are allowed? who regulates these signs? yes, there are two symbols in common use. they are the isa and the segd.isasegdwe prefer the segd pictograms, and, at least for us, this pictogram is more common. the older isa figure seems to be fading in general use.the international symbol of accessibility (isa) "stick-figure," is shown in the federal ada standards. it was originally supposed to be a wheelchair itself. and â its original intent was not to represent a person in a wheelchair! this comes as a surprise to almost everyone who has seen the symbol. the round shape at the top of the chair, to some, appears to be a head.the other pictogram in the common signage vernacular is known as the "segd pictogram." it is similar to the "male" and "female" pictograms that are seen on restroom signs all over the world. this segd pictogram was developed in response to the isa "stick-figure" pictogram, and was drawn so that it would specifically match with other widely used pictograms. most felt that the isa figure was not well designed, and, to some, even misguided. some felt that the wheelchair symbol should show a more active figure. disabled individuals are on the move, often athletic, and a static chair symbol was felt to be unbefitting.the segd figure, however, has not yet been recognized by the ansi committee that oversees the pictogram design specifications ... so there remains some controversy about its use. ultimately, it is up to the building owner to decide which symbol they want to employ. we find that most people prefer the segd wheelchair pictogram when it is used in conjunction with gender pictograms. the pictograms "match" stylistically â their line widths, spacing and body styles are consistent.in practice, and in our experience, we have yet to find an inspector that objects to the use of the segd pictogram. but at the end of the day, the choice of which pictogram to use is up to the building's management.if you want to substitute the isa "stick-figure" pictogram for a sign we now show with the segd pictogram â please contact us and we will gladly use the isa pictogram for your sign. top bradst. paul, mn are there alternative pictograms for the typical men and woman symbols? there is no legal set of pictograms defined by the federal or state governments for restroom signs. the common "man" and "woman" gender pictograms that you see everywhere are called dot pictograms. they were standardized by the us department of transportation (e.g. the "dot"). most restroom signs use these dot pictograms. for the visually impaired, however, there are sometimes concerns that the woman and man pictograms look too similar at a distance. alternative designs have been offered by several people. but none of these designs (other than the california title 24 designs) seem to have developed legs. they have not developed a following; the dot pictograms predominate. top scoreboards jacksonfrisco, co iâve just purchased a safety scoreboard for the factory i manage and am ready to set it up. how should i install my safety scoreboard? installing a safety scoreboard is extremely simple â they are made to give you as many options as possible for mounting them. our scoreboard is designed with two holes positioned at the top for easy mounting. the most common method is to place two hooks in the wall, where you want to install your scoreboard. but, really, you can mount the unit onto anything that works for the space you have â hang it with wire, nails, weld it onto something, or even just sit it on a ledge! there are a few critical considerations that we ask you to remember, however. for electronic scoreboards, you should place your safety scoreboard less than six feet away from a 120 v power source. and for indoor/outdoor models we remind you to be conscious of the electric hazard of an outdoor installation and use a gfi outlet. top signs bradlakeland, fl what grade of aluminum is used to make road sign blanks? we offer aluminum sign blanks in two alloys, 5052-h38 and 3105-h191. we carry multiple guages (thickness) including .040", .063", .080", .100", and .125". all aluminum is processed in-house to better control quality. we level, treat, cut, punch and radius aluminum coils into road sign aluminum blanks, all within our 65,000 square foot production facility. top deanvictor, ny who would ever spend 2-3x more for a diamond grade stop sign? yes, these diamond grade stop signs are much more costly. but, they are increasingly popular. use them for high traffic areas, areas with plenty of other visual distractions, or, when you want superb durability. many sign companies [and even film manufactures] have been heard to complain that diamond grade signs last too long. with a warranty of 12 years, we have seen most stop signs last longer. some states even have their dg3 signs on a 17 year replacement cycle â even though the warranty is only for 12 years. if you do the math, it is easy to see why a more expensive sign, once you consider the lifecycle costs and greater safety becomes, in fact, the most economical choice. top richardrancho cordova, ca what is photoluminescence? and, how is this different from fluorescent signs? these are two common material features for signs. photoluminescent signs glow-in-the-dark. fluorescent signs just exaggerate the impact of the color during the day time (and, especially, at dawn and dusk). click here to learn more. top thunaples, fl when i look at your site, i see that the supplemental ada sign that you recommend shows that the fine is $100. yet, i know that our community has fines that are larger. what is wrong? we show the state rules. understand that, in some communities, the local law may mandate a slightly greater fine. if so, please use one of the custom templates and add the correct fine amount. in our experience, however, only a very small portion of the [roughly] 3,000 counties or parishes across the us have special rules that overrule the state guidelines. please check, to make sure. top robertnew york, ny arenât the rules for reflective signs about to change [again] in 2009? yes, this is likely to be true. i may be stepping out on a limb, but here are some of our predictions: â¢ high intensity or diamond grade sheeting will be required for all traffic signs. â¢ engineer grade signs, however, are likely to be acceptable for parking signs. â¢ the official rules will take another two years in gestation. and, once they go into effect, traffic sign users will have from seven to ten years to phase in new signs. â¢ the impact will be that most sign buyers will start to switch all orders for traffic signs to these brighter materials. given the liability and lifecycle economics, this is probably the rational outcome. understand, of course, that rules change and that politics [can you imagine this!!] may interfere with the trends that look to be in place now. so, please check the rules as the develop! top michaelchesterfield, ma do you sell taller posts? a 10' post? note that we do not list these larger size of posts, although we certainly could ship these to you. the trouble is with shipping. ups handles posts that are 8' or shorter. longer posts must be shipped via a trucker. in most cases, the minimum trucking fee is $75.00. we have had too many customers (understandably) upset with a shipping bill that is $125 for a post that, itself, only cost $35 each. in many cases, it is easier to buy two smaller posts and bolt them together. there is further benefit too â you do not have to climb such a high ladder to drive the post into the ground. a heavy sledge hammer is tough enough to wield with two feet on the ground, let alone when you are precariously perched onto a ladder. top judybrunswick, nj when are 360â° breakaway posts used? these types of posts are found often for signs mounted in medians. the post can be hit from any direction. top stamps marilyneagle, id can my stamp have a custom graphic or logo? yes, but it must be a graphic or logo that is 1 color. the graphic must be a .bmp, .jpg, .wmf or .tif file type. top fredaurora, co do you have a catalog? not currently. we offer low prices and ease of use on-line. this saves us money on catalogs and helps deliver a great value to you, the customer. top |  about us |  contact us |  help & faqs |  disclaimer |  policies |  shops © 2010, smartsign.com
