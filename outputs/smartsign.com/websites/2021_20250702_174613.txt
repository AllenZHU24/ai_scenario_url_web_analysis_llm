a. custom signs give you the freedom to design your unique sign. these are usually in a template form where you can add your text, upload a logo, etc. our completely customizable ‘upload your own art’ signs bring personalization to the next level by allowing you to do more. with these signs, you can have your design transformed into a sign. this can include everything from the sign text, font, and alignment to colors, motifs, graphics, and more. q. how do i create a sign message that works? a. creating an effective sign message is easy as long as you keep a few things in mind. your message should be specific and clear, as a vaguely worded text can defeat the purpose. ensure to put clear instructions, prohibitions, warnings, contact details, etc. at that same time, you may not want to use too many words on your sign but only use the words that are absolutely necessary to get the message across. it is mostly a good idea to keep things short and simple. it is also recommended to create a sign message with three parts, a headline text, an explanatory text, and a call to action. you could, where possible, try and include an element of humor as such signs tend to work better as attention grabbers. some smart wordplay or a cleverly drafted text can get you all the eyeballs you desire and more! you may refer to this tiny video tutorial that we have created to help you create your perfect text! q. are reflective my custom signs available? a. yes, most of our custom signs are offered in both non-reflective and reflective formats. the ‘upload your own design’ custom signs with up to four colors on a single sign are available in three reflective options: engineer-grade, high-intensity, and diamond-grade. q. i want my custom sign in octagon shape. is it possible? a. it certainly is! this quote generator lets you choose from a variety of sign shapes, including octagon. you may further choose from sizes ranging from 12”x12” to 36”x36”, select the material and color, mounting hole preferences, any special instructions, and share your design for us to transform it into your perfect custom sign! q. are these fully custom signs offered in the wall or post mounting layout only? a. in addition to rigid aluminum signs, we offer custom signs in a variety of other layouts as well. you may explore our custom slipsafe™ floor sign, coneboss sign, floorboss standing floor sign, bigboss portable sidewalk sign, and lawnboss® sign & stake kit. q. how durable are custom full-color signature signs? a. made of 80 mil thick, rustproof aluminum, our custom full-color signature signs last at least seven years outside. these are available in a variety of stylish colors and shapes and have pre-drilled holes for easy installation. q. what is the 3m smartshield pof laminate? a. smartshield™ pof laminate is a way to enhance the durability of signs further. this 3m laminate prevents graphics from weather and fading, significantly extends the life of your sign, and makes it extremely easy to remove marks and graffiti from the sign. q. how do i select the right font for my custom sign? a. the font you should choose for your custom sign will depend on the message the sign conveys. when it’s a simple, straightforward message such as a warning or a prohibition, it may be a good idea to stick to an easy-to-read, headline-style font. an example of this is franklin gothic. when you are using a sign like a designer sign, you may opt for a more elegant or fancier option, such as helvetica. when deciding the font for your sign, it may be a good idea to stick to one or maybe two styles to prevent the sign from looking cluttered. font size is an equally important consideration and will depend on factors such as sign size, which part of the text must be emphasized, viewing distance, etc. please watch this short video that explains how you may finalize the right font for your sign. q. is it possible to provide any special design instructions for my custom sign? a. of course, it is. while placing the order, you will find an instruction box titled “special instructions”. you may leave your instructions there for our team, who will send a proof to you for approval. q. how long will my custom sign take to be delivered? a. all of our custom items are made to order and can take anywhere between three to five business days in production before they are shipped. the order is released into production the business day after the proof is approved, and the order is delivered within seven to ten business days. customer reviews donald dec 06, 2021 customizable sign : custom horizontal 1-color printed... part #: k-3408-h-a1 12" x 18" engineer grade reflective aluminum sign verified purchase custom pool sign they were very easy to work with and sent me an alternative to my custom design that met new florida requirements for pool signs. they followed up with a final version for my approval before making the sign and shipment. and it arrived exactly as ordered. michael dec 06, 2021 18in. x 18in. custom dome shaped... : upload your own art (full color) part #: k2-3424 18" x 18" reflective aluminum signature designer signs verified purchase custom sign i was able to upload an image and it came out perfect. josie dec 06, 2021 18in. x 18in. custom dome shaped... : upload your own art (full color) part #: k2-3424 18" x 18" reflective aluminum signature designer signs verified purchase custom artwork looks great on sign this custom sign is perfect. the artwork was made in procreate on the ipad and it turned out awesome on the sign. there was a small dent in the bottom left corner from shipping, but it's an outdoor sign and i'm very happy with it! luxx dec 06, 2021 18in. x 18in. custom palladio sign™ : upload your own art (full color) part #: k2-3427 18" x 18" aluminum palladio designer signs verified purchase beautiful sign the sign is beautiful. definitely, if i need another sign, i will do business, again. also, you have an excellent customer service skill. thank you. luz cecile dec 03, 2021 customizable sign : custom horizontal 1-color printed... part #: k-3408-h-a1 12" x 18" high intensity reflective aluminum sign verified purchase great sign. great service. great sign. great service. see all reviews categories custom metal signs custom plastic signs sidewalk signs popular signs numbers & letters support contact us reviews about us terms privacy products videos free sign pdf's blog accessibility ca privacy rights bbb rating © 2021, smartsign.com top
