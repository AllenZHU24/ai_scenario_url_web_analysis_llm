you may refer to this tiny video tutorial that we have created to help you create your perfect text! q. are reflective my custom signs available? a. yes, most of our custom signs are offered in both non-reflective and reflective formats. the âupload your own designâ custom signs with up to four colors on a single sign are available in three reflective options: engineer-grade, high-intensity, and diamond-grade. q. i want my custom sign in octagon shape. is it possible? a. it certainly is!

q. are these fully custom signs offered in the wall or post mounting layout only? a. in addition to rigid aluminum signs, we offer custom signs in a variety of other layouts as well. you may explore our custom slipsafeâ¢ floor sign, coneboss sign, floorboss standing floor sign, bigboss portable sidewalk sign, and lawnbossâ® sign & stake kit. q. how durable are custom full-color signature signs? a. made of 80 mil thick, rustproof aluminum, our custom full-color signature signs last at least seven years outside. these are available in a variety of stylish colors and shapes and have pre-drilled holes for easy installation. q. what is the 3m smartshield pof laminate? a. smartshieldâ¢ pof laminate is a way to enhance the durability of signs further. this 3m laminate prevents graphics from weather and fading, significantly extends the life of your sign, and makes it extremely easy to remove marks and graffiti from the sign. q. how do i select the right font for my custom sign? a. the font you should choose for your custom sign will depend on the message the sign conveys. when itâs a simple, straightforward message such as a warning or a prohibition, it may be a good idea to stick to an easy-to-read, headline-style font. an example of this is franklin gothic. when you are using a sign like a designer sign, you may opt for a more elegant or fancier option, such as helvetica. when deciding the font for your sign, it may be a good idea to stick to one or maybe two styles to prevent the sign from looking cluttered. font size is an equally important consideration and will depend on factors such as sign size, which part of the text must be emphasized, viewing distance, etc. please watch this short video that explains how you may finalize the right font for your sign. q. is it possible to provide any special design instructions for my custom sign? a. of course, it is. while placing the order, you will find an instruction box titled âspecial instructionsâ. you may leave your instructions there for our team, who will send a proof to you for approval. q. how long will my custom sign take to be delivered? a. all of our custom items are made to order and can take anywhere between three to five business days in production before they are shipped. the order is released into production the business day after the proof is approved, and the order is delivered within seven to ten business days. customer reviews mary may 26, 2025 18in. x 24in. custom palladio signâ¢ : upload your own art (full color)... part #:k2-3428 18" x 24" aluminum architecturally designed signs - engineer grade reflective verified purchase custom parking sign. the staff was really good to work with. this is the second sign we ordered in a brown background color. it was offered on a competitor's site but we asked if they could do it and the design team said "you got it!" lisa may 19, 2025 18in. x 24in. custom dome shaped... : upload your own art (full color)... part #:k2-3425 18" x 24" high-intensity reflective aluminum signature designer signs verified purchase sign once the artwork was approved the sign was delivered timely and it was just what we were looking for. laurence may 19, 2025 customizable sign : custom horizontal 1-color printed... part #:k-3408-h-a1 12" x 18" heavy-duty aluminum sign, 63 mil verified purchase sign of the times jenny lugo deserves a "signing bonus" for great service laurence may 12, 2025 customizable sign : custom horizontal 1-color printed... part #:k-3408-h-a1 12" x 18" heavy-duty aluminum sign, 63 mil verified purchase nicely done multi colored sign came out well jenny deserves a âsigning bonusâ. laurence may 12, 2025 customizable sign : custom horizontal 1-color printed... part #:k-3408-h-a1 12" x 18" heavy-duty aluminum sign, 63 mil verified purchase signing bonus well designed see all reviews × categories custom parking & traffic property & security safety door & facility posts & bases by industry address signs support contact us reviews about us terms privacy products videos free sign pdf's blog accessibility ca privacy rights w9 form bbb rating follow us on visitor no. 388 059 361 © 2025, smartsign.com top loading... accessibility menu accessibility profiles reset all motor impaired color blind dyslexia visually-impaired cognitive & learning seizure & epileptic adhd contrast + highlight links bigger text text spacing pause animations hide images dyslexia friendly cursor line height text align saturation report accessibility reset all accessibility settings
