smart signs are clear. your signs are about you. they advertise your message, which needs to be crystal clear. our award-winning symbols and industry-leading range of customizable designs makes sure that your message is not only read but understood. smart signs are affordable. why spend more than you should? at smartsign, our customers are important to us, so much so that price takes a back seat to customer loyalty.. we know that when you compare us to the competition, youâll always smile at the money you save. find a lower price elsewhere? give us a call and weâll match the price, no problem. sign buyers have paid too much, for too long! smart signs are easy to find. in the past, the right sign was nearly impossible to find. you may have had to dig through massive mail order catalogs, carpet-bombed to your address, to find your message. or, you may have designed your own sign, and paid heavily for that privilege. smartsign continually updates its unique design tools so that you are more than a few clicks away from the right sign. your days of blind searches and sky-high prices are over. at smartsign, instant searches, focused sites. and compelling landing pages all work together with you to find (or design!) your perfect sign. smart signs are durable. smartsignâs products are the most durable on the market today. while most internet retailers will rely on cheaper ink jet printing to create so-called âbannerâ presses, smartsign uses only 3m inks and films. weâre in the business of safety, and weâll never risk your message on low-quality ink that will never last outside, or indoors at some of the large municipal and industrial distributors that rely on our products. our policy: when your life is on the line, buy smart. our mission: smarter signs save lives âwe take the agony out of finding and ordering your perfect sign.â — blair brewster, smartsign founder traditionally, signs with the right message have been hard to find, hard to design, and hard to order. smartsign changes all that. our office motto, after all, is âsigns as solutions.â through highly targeted, content-rich and authoritative sites, smartsign provides specific solutions to specific problems. looking to keep our roads safe and our children safer? we have your customizable and regulation signs, that remind drivers to take caution around parks and school zones. weâve also got parking signs of all types and highway regulation signs for all states, through which we work to decrease distracted driving, and encourage drivers to put down the phone before they start the engine. are you an employer dedicated to a safer workplace?
