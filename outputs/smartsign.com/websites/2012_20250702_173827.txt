cashier's check, or credit card (visa, mastercard, discover or american express cards are accepted). we do not accept cod orders. for your added security, we use encrypted payment systems (128 bit ssl) on our website so no clear text copies of your credit card number are transmitted over the internet. because smartsign.com is a smartsign store, your credit card statement will show the name, smartsign. we reserve the right to require a deposit of up to fifty percent (50%) of the order value for all orders over one-thousand dollars ($1,000) before beginning production. a late charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, eighteen percent (18%) per year will be applied to account balances not paid in accordance with our terms. any account balances still owing six (6) months after

an order does not constitute an offer to sell. each order shall be reviewed on its merits and is subject to acceptance by seller. post order paperwork: one of the reasons our prices are so competitive is that we keep our overhead to a minimum. the internet allows us to keep our distribution and paperwork costs extremely low. except for providing a w-9 and/or an invoice, we will not countenance any requests from our customers to comply with their post order paperwork needs. so if your purchasing procedures require your suppliers to complete a questionnaire, certify that they have not bribed a foreign government, register, provide bank account information or references, or even just sign a purchase order, we suggest you take your business elsewhere. by ordering on our website you agree that you are liable to pay for the goods we sell you even if we do not meet any of your post order paperwork demands. top delivery we begin processing all orders the day that you finish your design. most orders of stock items are shipped in one (1) to three (3) days. most custom orders are shipped in two (2) to seven (7) working days. for rush orders, please contact our csr department. use our
