shipping and returns shipping and returns how will my order ship: beyond stores is committed to making sure that we use the safest and most reliable shipping method available. every product and supplier on our site has been carefully selected to ship by a particular shipping method in order to make sure that you get an optimal shipping experience. when your order ships, we will notify you via email. included in the email, will be your tracking # and a phone number to contact the carrier. we encourage you to call the carrier directly to arrange for your delivery. additionally, your tracking # will be available when you sign into your customer portal. we ship our orders out using three different shipping methods: they are small parcel, truck freight, and white glove delivery small parcel - whenever possible, beyond stores will ship out our smaller and lighter items using fedex, ups, or usps. these companies provide the quickest and most efficient service for the smaller items that we sell. regular transit time will be between 1 and 7 days once the item(s) ship from the warehouse. we do not send our items out with a signature required. however, since the driver has the final discretion, please leave a note on your door that asks the driver to leave your package with no signature required as well as your name and tracking number. truck freight - freight delivery means that your product is shipped via a large truck. freight service is used when the item shipped is too large or too heavy to ship via small parcel. freight items will arrive between 2 and 8 business days from the time the item leaves the warehouse. deliveries are made between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. from monday through friday. the delivery agent will call in advance to schedule an appointment time, which is generally a 4 hour window. there are different methods of freight delivery that we use. curbside - the driver will deliver your items to the driveway or curb outside the delivery address provided upon purchase. the delivery agent may require assistance with bulkier or heavier items. it is the customers responsibility to transport the item into their home or another area of choice. often times a driver may provide assistance, but is not required to. the delivery driver will not dispose of packaging material and will not assist in setting up your items. front door service - this method of service is similar to above only the delivery agent will deliver your order inside your garage or inside the threshold of your front door. please note: if you live in an apartment complex with no freight elevator or have exterior steps, this service will not be provided. room of choice - a two man team will deliver the product inside your home, to the room of choice designated by you. this service includes one flight of exterior and one flight of interior stairs. the product will remain in its original packaging. no assembly will be performed. room of choice with packaging removal - this option includes the services provided in room of choice. in addition, the item will be unpacked, basic setup is provided (no tools or assembly) and all debris will be removed. full assembly service - this option includes all those listed in room of choice with packaging removal. in addition there is 30 minutes provided for assembly service using basic hand tools. white glove premier - many of our large and fragile items will ship via a specialized furniture white glove service.. unlike many of our competitors who hire "last mile agents" who only receive your freight from a freight carrier and may not be trained on assembling your items correctly, for this service we utilize companies who only move and assemble furniture. this means that from the time your item leaves the warehouse up until the item reaches your home, it has been handled by a company who knows how to handle furniture and delicate items. this extra care cuts down any potential damage significantly. the items are inspected at the delivery companys warehouse and once the item(s) pass inspection, the scheduling agent will be contacting you to set up a delivery time for full assembly. due to the careful nature of this delivery process the items may take from one week to four weeks. this means that at least two individuals will bring the items into your home from the truck, take your items up two flights of stairs if required, unpack your items from the box, and assemble your items ordered to your satisfaction. once we email you the tracking #, please feel free to contact the shipping company directly for any additional services. you will be responsible for directly paying the truck freight carrier should you choose additional services. what to do upon delivery: please make sure you inspect your items before you sign the delivery receipt. please make sure all the items that you ordered are correct and all pieces are accounted for. if a box is missing, you may accept the delivered pieces, notate on the drivers receipt that there is a shortage of items and send us a claim via email at [email protected]. we will make sure that your missing item(s) are delivered to you promptly and free of charge. if your order arrives damaged, you may choose to refuse the delivery. if you choose to do so, you must write on the delivery receipt refused due to damage. if only part of an item or part of your order is damaged, you may accept the order and must notate on the delivery receipt "refused piece(s) due to damage". we will make sure that a replacement to your damaged item(s) is promptly sent to you free of charge. once you have signed the delivery receipt with a notation of damage or missing items, please make sure to ask the delivery agent for a copy of the receipt. if you discover damages after the delivery is complete, and it is within 24 hours, please email us at [email protected] explaining the situation and attach relevant

to withstand any damage that would occur during shipment. beyond stores regularly does a full evaluation of all lines we carry to make sure that the vendor is keeping packaging to a high standard. however, despite all of these precautions listed above, damage does occasionally occur. if you receive an item and it appears only slightly damaged, please write package damaged on the form the driver hands to you at the time of delivery. this step is very important. if the package looks like it is significantly damaged, you may refuse delivery. please notate on the form the driver hands to you, refused due to damage. this damaged package will be returned to us and we will send out a new package out to you. if you did not notice any damage while receiving the item and accepted the package, you must notify us within 24 hours so we may file a claim with the carrier. if only part of your order is damaged, we will send you replacement parts if available. if replacement parts are not available, we will have the carrier pick up the package in the original packaging and send out a replacement item. if the item received is defective due to a manufacturers issue, we will either replace the defective part or if necessary replace the entire defective unit. please send us an email for your claim to [email protected] so that a claims specialist can start working on your issue right away. if you choose that you do not want a replacement part or unit, you may return the item under our standard return policy. if a product arrives damaged, or we errored by sending the wrong product and we cannot remedy the situation with either a full replacement or replacement part, we will pay to return the item to us and refund you in full. canceling an item or order you may cancel an order or item at any time until the item has shipped out of the warehouse. once the item ships out of the warehouse, we cannot cancel your item. you may however, elect to return your item under our standard return policy. please note: any item that is estimated to ship out within two days cannot be canceled as the item is immediately pulled from the warehouse and packaged for shipment. when will my order arrive? on each of our products, there is an estimated ship date as well as an estimated delivery date. to provide our customers with a large selection, we ship from many different warehouses around the country. each product lead time depends on many variables. some warehouses have the items in stock and just need to process and prepare the order for shipment while other warehouses may have to wait a longer time to receive the item in stock. this is why we give our customers an idea of lead time, by stating usually ships in so that you will have an idea of how quickly the order will leave the warehouse. once the item leaves the warehouse the time it takes to get to you will be dependent on the method of shipment. on our product page, it gives an estimated shipping date. for small parcel shipments, the item(s) take between 1 and 6 business days from pickup .for truck freight, delivery usually takes between 2 and 10 business days from the time your order ships. for white glove shipments, your order takes between one and four weeks from the time the item(s) leave the warehouse. tracking packages go to your customer portal to track the status of your shipment and click on the tracking section. if you have multiple orders or an order that might have multiple items from different vendors, you will be able to select the specific order or item you are looking for. if the items you are trying to track have shipped, the tracking information with carrier will be listed. shipping to canada: shipping policy to canada we are happy to ship to all canadian provinces. we
