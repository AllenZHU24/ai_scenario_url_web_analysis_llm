(take that jason!) we've known jillian for a while now ... she's been a customer of ours for years. so when we heard that jillian was picked to be the next choosy single, we invited her down to the store for an afternoon of shopping fun. four hours later she walked out with a new aritzia wardrobe including select pieces from wilfred, talula, current/elliot and more. watch her turn 25 eligible dudes' heads on the next season of the "the bachelorette" airing on abc this may. good luck jilly! we'll be watching. comments (0) policies sitemap aritzia © 2009. all rights reserved.
