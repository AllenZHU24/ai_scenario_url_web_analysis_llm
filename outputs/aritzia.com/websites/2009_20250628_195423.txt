comments (0) just in stores: wilfred lux jersey tee! june 1, 2009 by aritzia in raw style, style highlights every girl has a set of t-shirts in her drawer.  it really is the most basic of essentials but wilfred has changed it up a little bit with their light-weight, perfectly cut jersey tee.  done right, we think there is nothing more fresh yet classic. comments (0) just in stores: tna crew neck sweat shirt! may 21, 2009 by aritzia in style highlights some pieces are just classic...like this heather grey tna crew neck.  it's soft, beautifully fit, and simple to wear.  a must for this season but we bet you'll wear it long after summer has passed. comments (0) just in stores: the oversized button-up shirt may 13, 2009 by aritzia in style highlights the oversized button-up shirt by talula just hit our stores! during the hot and sultry weather ahead, this is what we'll be wearing! neither under or overdressed, the oversized button-up makes looking good simple! comments (0) just in stores: all day i dream hoodie! may 8, 2009 by themarianista in style highlights this tna hoodie pretty much sums up what we've been feeling lately... when we finally do hit the ocean this summer, we'll spend the entire day soaking in the sun and waves and we will not leave until long after the sun has gone down!   as we make our way home, we'll reach for this very hoodie, put it on to keep us warm, and dream of doing it all over again! comments (0) new summer lookbook may 7, 2009 by aritzia in style highlights our summer lookbook is up and you can check it out here. if you didn't get our email this week, be sure to sign up for our email list.  we'll send you updates on when our new collections come out, new stores open, or when have new content we're excited about on aritzia.com.  sign up here. comments (0) summer lookbook coming soon! april 29, 2009 by themarianista in behind the scenes, style highlights we've been working to finalize our selections for the summer lookbook update... almost there.  can't wait to post them! comments (0) warm weather! march 31, 2009 by themarianista in style highlights is it just me or is it starting to feel like summer might actually come this year? here at the office we've been dying to rock our cut-off denim shorts sans black tights and everything else that comes with warm weather! with spring in the air we thought we'd look at our spring/summer runway show to see what else is coming ... i usually get most excited about dressier fashion items - but since my boyfriend will probably kill me if i don't get my own oversized hoodie soon, this oversized tna hoodie is on my list. i had almost forgotten how amazing this graphic tna tank is! i just looked into it and its hitting the stores in just a few weeks. also in this photo, and also tna ... that sleeveless flannel. oh the layering possibilities! i am all over this light denim bag. light denim is the rage this season and i love the idea of wearing a black dress but still getting a hit of light denim. good one talula. so good. okay, here's the deal - if you like this shirt as much as we do at the office, i suggest you *get on it* because everyone is talking about this owl graphic oversize tee. the fit is awesome, as is the print - and there just might be a bit of fight for these. i'm not even sure how many we're getting. also, these current/elliot jeans are rad. they're already in stores and the slashes will keep you cool well into the heat of summer. comments (2) wilfred spring + summer 2009 march 26, 2009 by aritzia in style highlights some of our top fashion in store this season is from wilfred's spring/summer collection. if you haven't already check out the new wilfred spring site. we're loving the lookbook shot by fashion photographer derek kettela (who's shot for uniqlo, karen walker sunglasses, w magazine to name a few). comments (1) mackage x aritzia jacket gets around march 19, 2009 by themarianista in style highlights our mackage for aritzia exclusive collaboration is going on strong! we were pleased to find out via the globe and mail that it had made its way to the streets of paris during fashion week. and right up to the doors of the christian dior show no less! here's our two exclusives with mackage this season. and stay tuned for more exclusive mackage for aritzia pieces this fall 09. comments (1) 1 of 2 ›› policies sitemap aritzia © 2009. all rights reserved.
