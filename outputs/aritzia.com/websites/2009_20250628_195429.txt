(take that jason!) we've known jillian for a while now ... she's been a customer of ours for years. so when we heard that jillian was picked to be the next choosy single, we invited her down to the store for an afternoon of shopping fun. four hours later she walked out with a new aritzia wardrobe including select pieces from wilfred, talula, current/elliot and more. watch her turn 25 eligible dudes' heads on the next season of the "the bachelorette" airing on abc this may. good luck jilly! we'll be watching. comments (0) earth hour march 23, 2009 by aritzia in our stores earth hour is a global wwf climate change initiative. individuals, businesses and governments will turn out their lights for one hour to show their support for action on climate change. this year, earth hour aims to reach 1 billion people in 1,000 cities. on march 28th aritzia stores will participate by dimming their lights or shutting the lights off completely during earth hour. by participating in this event we hope to help show the world that if we work together we can help in the fight against climate change. you can help too! for more information or ways to get involved in earth hour, please visit earthhour.org. comments (2) yyellowbird’s art photography march 2, 2009 by aritzia in art & design, our stores, projects cari wayman is our featured artist for spring 2009. you probably don't recognize her name ... until recently, we didn't even know what her real name was; she was known to us only as "yyellowbird," the young and talented flickr user we stumbled upon last year. cari isn't your average photographer, in fact, she doesn't even consider herself to be a "photographer" - instead she says that she "takes pictures". and though this may be an accurate statement, we think cari is being very humble: her pictures have caught the attention of visual scavengers worldwide and have since been popping up all over the internet - posted on blogs, being flagged on ffffound, and favorited on flickr. we are very excited to be the first to take cari's work out of the virtual world by working with her as our spring 09 featured artist. look-out for more about cari in the coming weeks! check our cari’s flickr page. comments (5) ryan ryan ryan february 3, 2009 by r in art & design, our stores yesterday the blog a year in pictures posted this shot of photographer ryan mcginley. ryan is trying out the other side of the lens for the current marc jacobs campaign ... which, as usual and as expected, was shot by the very talented jurgen teller. if you didn't know already, aritzia has been working with ryan for the past few months - featuring his work on our bags, collateral, and website. we love how he seems to create and capture the essence of spontaneous moments. obviously we're not the only people who admire his work ... because he has teamed up with british art star dinos chapman to create the spring/summer 09 stella mccartney campaign (below). it has a different look to it than his other work but is still beautiful. comments (0) new! tna store opening toronto eaton centre november 25, 2008 by themarianista in events, our stores excited to open our first tna store in toronto, we've been working around the clock! so we're pleased to announce that our doors are opening ahead of schedule next weekend on saturday december 6th! our newest tna eaton centre store will be our biggest location to date and will carry every style & colour in the tna collection. the store will also feature a custom built-in photo booth (fun!) and as always our favourite artwork. be sure to come by to check out! oh and keep your eyes peeled for our first tna artist series, a julia feyrer hoody (shown below), t-shirt and tote ... comments (12) 1 of 2 ›› policies sitemap aritzia © 2009. all rights reserved.
