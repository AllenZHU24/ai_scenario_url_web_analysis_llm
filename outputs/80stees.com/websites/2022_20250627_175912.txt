from $39.99 view all 80s cartoons products a message from the founder i launched 80stees.com in 1999 because i would wear my favorite 80s cartoons on tees and people would ask me where i got them.to this day my t-shirt wardrobe is not much different from when i was a kid.  it's filled with he-man, transformers, and gi joe shirts and lots of superhero shirts which of course include the classics like superman shirts and spiderman shirts.  spider-man has been my favorite super hero since i was 2 years old when i had the mego doll with the fabric costume.  and don't tell anyone but i even sometimes sport a deadpool shirt even though he wasn't even created until the 1990s.i plan to stay on target with our star wars shirts and provide the most fun collection of 80s pop culture t-shirts on the web for a long time to come, because i think it's what is best in life.  we don't plan to stop, even if frankie says relax.  after all, there are tons more corny ways i can use my favorite top gun quotes on t-shirts.  and it's not all about me, our goal is to have something for everyone that loves retro pop culture.  whether your favorite cartoon is jem and the holograms or robotech, or your favorite movie is the karate kid or sixteen candles, my goal is that you'll find something you love.- kevin founder of 80stees.com wwe have a macho christmas randy savage t-shirt from $39.99 have

details? we offer free shipping on orders of $100 or more. most shirts print in 5-7 business days before shipment. you can see your shipping options before paying by proceeding through checkout. what are your product sizing details? each product with a size has a unique size chart associated to the product. on any product page, click on "view size chart" to view sizing information specific to that product. measurements are provided in in. and cm. so that you can compare those measurements to something that fits well from home. do you have any discounts? you can receive a discount by subscribing

wholesale orders? here is our info on bulk ordering why are your shirts expensive? we did raise our prices due to the free shipping option, but that is only a small part of the price increase. we just were not making any money. the prices of the blanks and the licensing agreements have been rising much faster than our pricing. we had to make a decision if we are going to stay in business to raise our prices. as a result of that, we will also be able to have more sales and promotions which you can receive by subscribing to the newsletter. here is the founder's blog about the change. do you have

✉email us so we can see if it's possible with the licensing. are your shirts soft? the 100% cotton shirts tend to be the sturdier, heavier shirts. the cotton/poly blends are the softer styles. you can see the specifics on fabric by scrolling down the product page to the details section. we don't currently have a filter for fabric composition, but here is a link to all of our styles that contain any polyester, which may help narrow it down a bit. are your shirts officially licensed? yes, we've been in business for 21 years selling officially licensed shirts. you can find that info on each product page. why can't you ship to the uk? we are not currently shipping to the uk with the new vat laws that are going into effect. it will take us some time to adjust our ordering software to accommodate the new regulations. my question isn't listed here. if you have another question, please ✉️ send us a message at help@80stees.com and we will get back to you with an answer. more questions?
