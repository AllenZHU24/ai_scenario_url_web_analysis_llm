and to top that off, his mom even made him a birthday cake with an outline of a t-shirt on it when he was a kid. kevin was born in 1977 and grew up with practically all the characters and titles we sell and he has always loved t-shirts! here are some pictures showing kevin wearing some original 80stees. kevin's favorite toys of the 1980s were, by far, the masters of the universe collection. one day at penn state, he walked by a little shop and saw a he-man and the masters of the universe t-shirt. amazing! he bought the shirt and it was immediately his favorite t-shirt. the 80stees business idea really started in the summer of 1999 when kevin wore the he-man t-shirt to kennywood, a pittsburgh amusement park. throughout the day many people approached him and asked, "where did you get that shirt?". he realized that these shirts obviously were not easy enough to find, and he changed that by creating 80stees.com. kevin graduated in 1999 from penn state university with a bachelor of science in geo-environmental engineering. upon graduation, he had a few weeks to kill before starting his new job for an environmental consulting firm. so he made a deal to bulk purchase some retro shirts from the small store in state college, pa, where he bought his original shirt. he started out selling transformers, thundercats, care bears, and strawberry shortcake t-shirts on ebay. after the first he-man shirt sold for over $30.00, he knew he had stumbled onto something that people wanted to buy! it was at this point that he began selling shirts on http://www.80stees.com, paving the way for the website you see today. where do you get those wonderful shirts? just as the joker wondered where batman gets all his wonderful toys, many people also wonder where we get our t-shirts. 80stees does not own the rights to all of the characters & licenses that we sell. rather, we buy most of the shirts wholesale from the license holders. for instance, we buy our star wars shirts from a company that has an agreement with george lucas. the company we buy from pays george lucas a royalty for every shirt they sell to us. providing a license to wear we do have a few license agreements that allow us to produce our own t-shirts. that is why our selection of top gun t-shirts is the best on the web. you can check out all of our original shirts in the exclusives section of the site. as we grow we will be adding even more licenses so that we can continue to offer the best selection of licensed t-shirts on the web. 80stees in the media it's likely that you have seen one of our many print advertisements in magazines such as maxim, us weekly, rolling stone, in touch, etc. our shirts have also been featured in the following tv shows and movies: how i met your mother (cobra kai gi worn by neil patrick harris) everybody loves raymond (batman shirt worn by chris elliot) blade: trinity (lost boys shirt worn by punk kid who attacks jessica biel) good morning america valentine's day (joel siegel gave a jake ryan shirt to a weekend anchor for a valentine's day segment on romantic movies) stacy keibler requested our shirts for a photo shoot for sole collector magazine. at the time stacy was known for being a wwe wrestler, but now she has shot to fame with her success on the abc show dancing with the stars. she appeared in a rainbow brite shirts and jem and the holograms shirts. mtv2 vj jim shearer has requested and worn 80stees' shirts wild hogs: tim allen's character wore our who made who ac/dc t-shirt ssl certificate home | help center | size chart | checkout | lookup order | contact us | press | delivery time | affiliate program | privacy terms of service | customer testimonials | email newsletter | returns | shipping | site map | about us copyright © 2000 - 2013 80stees.com, inc. 40 year old virgin 7up a-team adventure time aerosmith airplane alice cooper alice in wonderland always sunny in philadelphia american pie an american tail anchorman animal house aquaman arkham city arnold schwarzenegger arrested development atari avengers back to the future bad news bears barbie barney and friends batgirl batman battlestar galactica beastie boys beatles beavis and butthead betty white big bang theory big bang theory - bazinga!
