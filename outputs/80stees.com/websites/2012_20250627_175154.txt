i loved the shirts that i purchased from your company. thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! linda parkville, mo first off, let me just say that i'm sorry i'm not using your help center correctly. i don't know any other way to contact you guys to let you know that you're all awesome. i love your selection, quality of items, and the speed in which i receive my items. the main reason i wanted to email you though, is to give a huge special thanks to whoever drew iron man on my black sabbath shirt's packaging. you made my freaking day with that, whoever you are! thanks for everything! gavin gresham, or dear 80s tees, you really made my day. let's hang out. much love, nadya australia hello, i just wanted to thank you for your great products and customer service. i have been wanting to place an order with you for a while now, for some christmas pressies, and your 20% off offer couldn't have come at a better time! i found i was able to buy a t'shirt for everyone i wanted to (including me!) and furthermore, the 'star trek' monopoly was about a third of the price of what i would have paid for here. what a bargain!! in fact, the only thing that stopped me buying more was the jump in shipping when i reached a certain amount. after selecting and paying for my order, i was prepared to wait several weeks for it to arrive (i live in australia). so i was pleasantly surprised at how fast it got here! lastly, i am absolutely thrilled with the quality of your product. so, i will definitely be shopping with you again in the future. thanks again, and keep up the great work! regards, jacqui australia i just got my order of 3 big lebowski bowling shirts and i just love them. my bowling buddies and i are going to look too cool. i was afraid that they were going to be kinda cheap looking, but they look and feel like real bowling shirts. i can't wait to bowl tomorrow night to show them off. thanks again for the great product and quick service. linda wisconsin, us hello, just wanted to drop a note & say how incredibly quick & awesome you guys are. i didn't realize when i ordered that you guys are a local company. i used to work in the sony plant right there and have friends from scottdale. at any rate, i love the shirts & the site! you processed & shipped my order lightning quick, & it was even a short drive for ups. i'll be back! -eric pennsylvania, us hi!! i wanted to thank you and your company again for the awesome customer service 80's-tees gives. i have ordered from your company 3 times so far. the quickness of getting product to the customer is very impressive. my girlfriend and i were so impressed with the way your company handled the issue when the design on the shirt i bought her for her birthday peeled off after washing. we received a replacement the very next day after i emailed customer service!! we look forward to ordering more from your company & have told all our friends. thanks again! vicki pennsylvania, us hi guys, just wanted to say thanks for the great service. you sent this order the same day i placed it, and it arrived in the uk 1 week later. couldn't ask for more. will highly recommend you to anyone i know who is looking for a new t-shirt. thanks very much, ed cumbria, uk unbelievable service!
