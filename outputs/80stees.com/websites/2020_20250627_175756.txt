your loved ones companies like disney and hasbro require that their licensees test their products for safety. in the case of t-shirts that means that you can be sure that the paint on your t-shirt and the dyes in the material have been tested and are certified to be free from lead and other harmful chemicals. get more of what you love! if you love a show, video game, movie, etc. enough to wear a shirt then you probably want more of that show, video game, movie, etc. or at least want the creators to have funding to something new that you’ll love too! know that you are dealing with a reputable company if you are buying from a company that has no problem stealing intellectual property shouldn’t that make you wonder what else they’ll have no problem with? maybe it will be no problem with
