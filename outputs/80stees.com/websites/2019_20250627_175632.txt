founder i launched 80stees.com in 1999 because i would wear my favorite 80s cartoons on tees and people would ask me where i got them. to this day my t-shirt wardrobe is not much different from when i was a kid.  it's filled with he-man, transformers, and gi joe shirts and lots of superhero shirts which of course include the classics like superman shirts and spiderman shirts.  spider-man has been my favorite super hero since i was 2 years old when i had the mego doll with the fabric costume.  and don't tell anyone but i even sometimes sport a deadpool shirt even though he wasn't even created until the 1990s. i plan to stay on target with our star wars shirts and provide the most fun collection of 80s pop culture t-shirts on the web for a long time to come, because i think it's what is best in life.  we don't plan to stop, even if frankie says relax.  after all, there are tons more corny ways i can use my favorite top gun quotes on t-shirts.  and it's not all about me, our goal is to have something for everyone that loves retro pop culture.  whether your favorite cartoon is jem and the holograms or robotech, or your favorite movie is the karate kid or sixteen candles, my goal is that you'll find something you love. - kevin founder of 80stees.com wwe "to be the man, you gotta beat the man" champion's reflection macho man randy savage t-shirt from $36.22 have a macho
