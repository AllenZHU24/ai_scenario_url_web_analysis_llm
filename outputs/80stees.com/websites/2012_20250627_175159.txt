(stock symbol dmi) a mid-cap regional paper- and office-supply distributor with an emphasis on servicing small-business clients, now have an opportunity to display their love for the company from the office tv show by wearing a royal blue t-shirt featuring a distressed print of the company logo. although a fake brand may be obscure, that does not necessarily mean it is not meaningful. by way of example we have chico's bail bonds based out of the san fernando valley in southern california. when this wholly fictional company sponsored the bad news bears youth baseball team, they got their logo plastered on the t-shirts of this team of ragtag misfits; a veritable coup in the world of fake brands. chico's bail bonds brand loyalists can buy a distressed silk screen t-shirt that features the logo of the bear's team sponsor, chico's bail bonds. on the other end of the fake brand spectrum, the beloved duff beer perhaps has no equal in terms of both longevity and recognizability. if homer simpson ever wore anything besides a white shirt (and the occasional mummu) he would wear a red t-shirt featuring a distressed logo of the duff beer company. in order to be included in the top eight best global "fake" brands list, a fake brand must have a corresponding product - typically a t-shirt - available at www.80stees.com. that's pretty much it. although some of its brands may be fake, 80stees.com has a very real dedication to quality, inspecting every shirt for flaws in the fabric, printing and stitching - 80stees.com rejects a higher percentage of t-shirts for quality problems than any of its competitors, and most orders are shipped the same day they are placed. 1980s: been there, did that, got the t-shirt at 80stees.com north huntington, penn., aug. 9, 2005 � quick: who said "i feel the need, the need for speed!"?  what is the "contra code"? how did ralphie's dad pronounce the word "fragile?" and where exactly is fraggle rock? if you know any of the above answers, perhaps it's time for a visit to 80stees.com (http://www.80stees.com). prepare to stay awhile, though. the site is chock-full of memories in the form of t-shirts. while some are obvious '80s icons � who could forget rainbow brite, "i've been slimed," or the karate kid � others are more obscure references to '80s pop culture, identifiable only by others who came of age during that decade. greyskull, gi joe, punky brewster and alf are all there; ditto bon jovi, whitesnake, pat benatar and guns n' roses. 80stees.com is, of course, the brainchild of a child of the '80s. born in 1977, company founder kevin stecko is hard-pressed to produce a childhood photo in which he was not wearing a licensed character t-shirt. but, like many children of the '80s, stecko only hit on the idea for 80stees.com after first earning a completely unrelated degree: six months before graduating from penn state with a degree in geo-environmental engineering, stecko wore a he-man and the masters of the universe t-shirt to an amusement park. the shirt generated so much interest, stecko decided to see if he could sell some '80s-themed t-shirts himself. six years and twelve employees later, 80stees.com sells around 150,000 t-shirts per year and enjoys a steadily growing hollywood clientele. everybody loves raymond came knocking. so did good morning america, blade: trinity and an mtv vj.  several high profile professional athletes have ordered, including 4 members of the new york yankees. stecko attributes his site's success partially to its dedication to quality. his team inspects every shirt for flaws in the fabric, printing and stitching, and 80stees.com rejects a higher percentage of t-shirts for quality problems than do any of its competitors. most orders are shipped the same day they are placed. but stecko acknowledges nostalgia as the driving force behind 80stees.com's growth. "80s kids were bombarded with advertisements from the day they were born, and despite the fact that we now recognize those ads as exploitative we tend to have fond memories of our childhood toys and shows," stecko explained. "and let's face it. plenty of the movies, television shows, video games, music and products of the '80s are just downright amusing these days. it's a fun way to identify with others who also remember the '80s with a smile." for more information about 80stees.com, inc. or to order '80s t-shirts, visit http://www.80stees.com. contact: kevin stecko 80stees.com, inc. 724-696-5121 media contact email: ssl certificate home | help center | size chart | checkout | lookup order | contact us | press | delivery time | affiliate program | privacy terms of service | customer testimonials | email newsletter | returns | shipping | site map | about us copyright © 2000 - 2012 80stees.com, inc. 40 year old virgin 7up a-team adventure time aerosmith airplane alice cooper alice in wonderland always sunny in philadelphia american pie an american tail anchorman animal house aquaman arkham city arnold schwarzenegger arrested development atari avengers back to the future bad news bears barbie barney and friends batgirl batman battlestar galactica beastie boys beatles beavis and butthead betty white big bang theory big bang theory - bazinga!
