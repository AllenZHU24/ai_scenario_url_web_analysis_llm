started. if you still have questions, visit the eastwood garage or call seven days a week to speak with an expert.automotive paint frequently asked questionshow long after painting a car can you drive it? a few weeks after painting your car. no one likes seeing an orange peel texture, cracking or peeling, but exposing your vehicle to the environment right after a fresh paint job can do just that.some auto enthusiasts recommend keeping your freshly painted car in the garage for at least a month, but at the same time, you need to be realistic. you need to get places, so you'll have to take your car out on occasion.while there's no definite period, consider the following points: new paint takes at least 24 hours after application to cure. so avoid taking your car out of the garage during this time — and definitely avoid washing it. auto paint can take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to fully cure and adhere to the vehicle. during this period, as the paint matures, only take your car out in fair weather days — no extreme sun and no rain — and use it just for short trips.should you take it out, aspects like recently paved roads, debris, tree sap, and bird droppings won't just mar the paint, but will also cause it to crack easier and can affect the clear coat. furthermore, extreme temperatures — be it hot or cold — can create adhesion issues during the curing process, so be sure to keep your car sheltered and ideally in a controlled environment during this period. here's what else you should consider when caring for a recent paint job.how do i properly spray paint my car? diy auto painting projects are a multistep process. you'll start by stripping or sanding the old paint off. then, you'll apply primer, the base coat and the clear coat. you also need to think about rust patches — you can't just paint over them — and cleaning off debris and moisture to avoid texture and adhesion issues. in between, because you'll be handling solvents and using a paint gun, you need to adequately protect yourself against the chemicals in the air.to start, carve out a block of time to paint your car. then, be sure to have the following: protective gear, including safety glasses and a fresh air respirator system or a mask with a multi-stage filter. we also recommend a paint suit to protect your clothing. sanding supplies, including 1200- and 2000-grit wet-and-dry sandpaper and an electric sander — unless you plan to do the job by hand. masking tape air compressor or paint gun paint thinner mixing equipment auto paintas a rule, if you're planning to repaint a small- to medium-sized vehicle, have one gallon of base coat available and one gallon of primer plus two to three gallons of clear coat. for a larger vehicle, have 1.5 gallons of base coat ready and three to four gallons of clear coat. before starting, be sure to match the paint to your car's color by looking for the color code or vin number.learn more about how to get started painting your car.what is a good paint gun for beginners? paint guns come in a few styles, but the most popular is a high volume low pressure (hvlp) gun, which is designed to use less pressure while delivering more paint. these allow you to complete the job in less time.another popular option is a turbine paint system, which is a self-contained option that utilizes a turbine motor to compress the air.along with these attributes, think about the needle nozzle. be sure to have at least a 1.2-1.4 for the base coat/clear coat and 1.7-2.0 for the primer.resources: how to paint your own car. three tips for painting
