please review the information here and feel free to contact us if any questions!freight delivery requirements:if delivering to a location without a loading dock, your options are:delivery to your home: freight carriers have a variety of truck sizes and services that they can offer you when making final delivery. when the carrier reaches out to schedule your delivery appointment, it is critically important that you provide them with a description of your street and area so they can make sure the freight is loaded and delivered with the proper equipment. the carrier will only park on your curb (as long as it is not a highway), they will not come down your driveway. the road surface must be paved. other carrier limitations may apply (may not be able to deliver to cul-de-sac, private road or dead end). pickup: when the freight carrier calls you to make a delivery appointment, you may choose to pick up your shipment from the carrier's local service center. they will load it onto your vehicle. please make sure your vehicle is capable of handling the weight and bring plenty of tie-downs to secure the load freight delivery checklist:schedule the drop-off: the carrier will call to make an appointment, usually at least a day in advance. they deliver during regular business hours. please make sure to provide the best phone number to reach you when placing your order to prevent your order from being delayed or returned to us. be prepared to unload: once the carrier arrives you will be responsible for unloading the freight if there is no loading dock. if you cannot unload, liftgate service can be selected during checkout. with liftgate, the carrier will either assist with hand offloading or employ the use of a traditional hydraulic lift. you will still be responsible for moving the freight from the curbside to your shop or garage once it is off the truck. always inspect and record any damage. do not sign until inspected, and reject the shipment if there is any damage. it is extremely important that you write any box damage, no matter how minor, on the delivery/rejection receipt in case we need to replace the machine. this includes any dents, scuffs, tears, holes or if the original packaging appears to have been modified. it is also vital to verify the number of boxes received and write any shortages on the delivery receipt. if there is anything damaged, missing and/or repackaged make sure to take photos and reject the package. you will also need to call us to report the damage and we will work to resolve the issue for you as quickly as possible.please watch this short video on inspecting your freight shipment!  freight delivery lead time:we estimate, but cannot guarantee, that freight shipments may take 1-2 weeks for delivery due to carrier schedules. if the carrier considers your address to be rural, it could take an additional week for delivery depending how often they deliver in your area! about eastwood the early days...like a lot of high school kids, curt strohacker worked in a service station to earn some spending money, but he also repaired cars in his free time, buying and selling countless vehicles, and learning valuable lessons about restoration. as the market for automotive refurbishing began to take off in the 1970s, curt realized that proper tools and techniques could save enthusiasts like him time and money.so in the fall of 1978, curt launched a business to better serve the burgeoning market of auto restoration and customization hobbyists, and he called it eastwood.the first eastwood catalog was eight black-and-white pages of metal-finishing tools and equipment, and with continued success in the early ’80s, curt took the catalog’s operation into a professional list house, and 5,000 copies of the catalog were distributed annually. in addition to catalog marketing, eastwood also sold its line of products directly to restorers at select car shows.in august 1983, both the mercedes and bmw car clubs unexpectedly endorsed an eastwood car wash brush—sales multiplied and the staff soon doubled. the development of the eastwood spot-weld gun, a tool which duplicates the industrial spot-welds found on virtually every metal-bodied car, proved even more fortunate for the growing retailer.at that time, most of eastwood’s new business came from magazine ads in about a dozen publications. by the end of 1985, company advertisements appeared in over 50 magazines, including hot rod, car craft, and popular mechanics. in light of this, the catalog prospered as well, comprising 96 pages with a four-color cover in its 1986 iteration, which reached over 100,000 auto restorers bimonthly. as the company prepared to move into the new decade, eastwood’s customer file quickly grew to over a half-million auto restoration and customization enthusiasts.a leader in innovation – better than painteastwood’s own hotcoat® powder coating system revolutionized home workshops starting in 1997. by bringing an economical and easy-to-use powder-coating system into the garage, eastwood had given hobbyists a superior alternative to paint; powder-coating produced a more durable and attractive finish which easily lent itself to custom work. in september 1998, eastwood received the pennsylvania governor’s award for "environmental excellence", recognizing the low environmental impact of the hotcoat® system. in 1999, the automotive restoration market organization (armo) awarded hotcoat® the "best new product" for that year.in 2003, eastwood introduced its english wheel and planishing hammer, enabling a wider audience to access high-end metal-shaping tools. since eastwood’s research & development department emphasized economical manufacturing processes, it allowed them to offer both of these tools to its customers for under $1,000, an achievement which the armo acknowledged with a 2004 "people’s choice" award.expansion and growthrecognizing the efficiency and potential of the internet for improved customer interaction, eastwood launched separate websites for its tool catalog and its hotcoat® powder-coating products. those early sites contained information about new products and promotions, in addition to providing potential new customers with the opportunity to request an eastwood catalog. also, eastwood stocked the site with technical articles relating to its most popular products, as well as "how to" tips.beginning in january 1999, the sites also allowed customers to order all the products, integrating purchasing systems from a secure site. in order to further increase efficiency and simplicity, the hotcoat® site and tool site were both combined into the revamped, full-service, ecommerce website, eastwood.com, you’re visiting right now.in november 1999, the company broke ground to build a cutting-edge headquarters, warehouse, and retail store facility northeast of philadelphia, in pottstown, pennsylvania. following an aggressive, eight-month construction project, eastwood completely relocated to pottstown in july 2000.the 21st century has seen eastwood become one of the leading online retailers of automotive restoration products and supplies, while continuing to be the most innovative company in the industry. we have even begun to open brick and mortar retail outlets across the country. with in-house developed products from real restoration enthusiasts, eastwood has brought you the contour sct for stripping rust, paint and body filler, the qst 30/60 scroll compressor that powers all of your tools with the noise level of conversation. and the popularity of that air compressor led to the development of the industrial 3-phase version the qst 60-120. these amazing products brought a new brand – eastwood elite – which truly displayed the dedication to innovation. the welding line expanded to include professional mig, tig and even multi-process welders that were true ac/dc tig machines that could also mig weld. the elite cc500 and p500 hvlp paint guns were launched to provide incredible results. the home powder coating systems were improved and professional guns were added to the lineup. elite bead rollers , english wheels, shrinker-stretchers, panel cutting saws and tig welding tungsten grinders were added to the lineup. and the spring of 2023 saw one of the most innovative and helpful products ever developed for the auto resto industry – the elite contour dsb dustless sanding block system. the sanding block that allows you to block sand your car without you and your floor getting covered in dust while getting those laser straight panels you want. eastwood looks to the future of restoration and customizationsince its inception, eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customer satisfaction at the forefront. in recent years, the market for automotive hobbyists has expanded beyond the "classics", and eastwood has seen increased requests for products geared towards muscle cars, street rods, trucks and motorcycles. the explosion of the sport tuner hobby has demanded products which emphasize ease-of-use and variety, as customizers strive to make their vehicles truly unique. in response, the company has continued to be an industry pioneer, adding innovative, high-quality products to its line. for example, the hotcoat® system now allows for the powder-coating of larger parts, and in a huge array of colors and finishes. eastwood continues to prove its dedication to offering unique solutions to the challenges facing restoration and customization enthusiasts, and this devotion will ensure its place in the community. why eastwood tools for
