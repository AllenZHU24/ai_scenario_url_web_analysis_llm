powder-coating produced a more durable and attractive finish which easily lent itself to custom work. in september 1998, eastwood received the pennsylvania governor’s award for “environmental excellence”, recognizing the low environmental impact of the hotcoat® system. in 1999, the automotive restoration market organization (armo) awarded hotcoat® the “best new product” for that year. in 2003, eastwood introduced its english wheel and planishing hammer, enabling a wider audience to access high-end metal-shaping tools. since eastwood’s research & development department emphasized economical manufacturing processes, it allowed them to offer both of these tools to its customers for under $1,000, an achievement which the armo acknowledged with a 2004 “people’s choice” award. expansion and growth recognizing the efficiency and potential of the internet for improved customer interaction, eastwood launched separate websites for its tool catalog and its hotcoat® powder-coating products. those early sites contained information about new products and promotions, in addition to providing potential new customers with the opportunity to request an eastwood catalog. also, eastwood stocked the site with technical articles relating to its most popular products, as well as “how to” tips. beginning in january 1999, the sites also allowed customers to order all the products, integrating purchasing systems from a secure site. in order to further increase efficiency and simplicity, the hotcoat® site and tool site were both combined into the revamped, full-service, ecommerce website, eastwood.com, you’re visiting right now. though online retail has become increasingly prominent, eastwood continues to publish a monthly, full-size catalog containing quality tools and supplies vital for all facets of restoration and custom work. in november 1999, the company broke ground to build a cutting-edge headquarters, warehouse, and retail store facility northeast of philadelphia, in pottstown, pennsylvania. following an aggressive, eight-month construction project, eastwood completely relocated to pottstown in july 2000. eastwood looks to the future of restoration and customization since its inception, eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customer satisfaction at the forefront. in recent years, the market for automotive hobbyists has expanded beyond the “classics”, and eastwood has seen increased requests for products geared towards muscle cars, street rods, trucks and motorcycles. the explosion of the sport tuner hobby has demanded products which emphasize ease-of-use and variety, as customizers strive to make their vehicles truly unique. in response, the company has continued to be an industry pioneer, adding innovative, high-quality products to its line. for example, the hotcoat® system now allows for the powder-coating of larger parts, and in a huge array of colors and finishes. eastwood continues to prove its dedication to offering unique solutions to the challenges facing restoration and customization enthusiasts, and this devotion will ensure its place in the community. about eastwood company history contact us visit our retail store employment opportunities customer service my account customer service our guarantee faqs how to info online restoration forum free tech library eastwood blog videos top 20 tech questions email deals sign up now to receive exclusive email deals, industry news, and new product releases.* buy online or call 1-800-343-9353 about eastwood company history contact us employment opportunities retail locations - pottstown, pa - chicago, il customer service my account customer service our guarantee faqs request a catalog international customers how to info online restoration forum free tech library eastwood blog videos top 20 tech questions connect with us ©2014 the eastwood company. all rights reserved. *your privacy is important to us- eastwood does not sell, rent or share your email information source code: 1nt01
