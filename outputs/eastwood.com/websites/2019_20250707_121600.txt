ac/dc tig welder</h3> <p>a 200-amp eastwood tig welder is the most affordable way for mechanics and other metal workers to get excellent welds on all of their projects. this ac/dc tig welder uses a tungsten electrode to heat metals and joins them together without becoming part of the finished weld, reducing splatter and mess. the ac mode is used for aluminum, while the dc mode can be used to weld steel and stainless steel in tube, sheet or bar stock form, offering incredible versatility in a skilled set of hands. a stick-weld feature is available as well for use in outdoor conditions or on dirty metals.</p> <img alt="eastwood tig 200 ac/dc welder" class="mobimage01" height="inherit" name="" src="https://www.eastwood.com/images/20565infoimage640_2.jpg" /><br> <p>our team has designed

welds thanks to the high-frequency instant start and square-wave ac inverter that assist with control and accuracy. it is rated for a duty cycle of 60 percent at normal amperage, meaning you can weld continuously for up to six minutes and complete a large section in one fell swoop.</p> <img alt="eastwood tig 200 ac/dc welder" class="mobimage01" height="inherit" name=""

tungsten rods and a lot more. we've included a variable foot pedal as well to set the amperage anywhere from 10 to 200 amps depending on project needs. eastwood backs each welder with a 3-year

large surfaces. this innovative system will allow you to achieve the benefits of powder coating small parts instead of coating them with paint. the new dual-voltage system gives you the capability to coat small areas using the low 15kv setting or coat large areas using the high-voltage setting 25kv. all you need is a compressed air source (5-10 psi from a portable tank with a regulator or a compressor) to power your gun, an electric oven or toaster oven to cure the finish and a well-ventilated workspace in which to do your coating.</p><p> <strong>advantages of powder coating</strong></p><p> the dual-voltage hotcoat gun is one of the best powder coating guns on the market today. why powder coat? because it gives you one of the most economical, color-durable and longest-lasting finishes available. you'll find powder coated surfaces are far more resistant to chipping, scratches, fading, and wear than other finishes, and the color selection is virtually unlimited, with high and low gloss, metallic, and clear finishes available. and thanks to the uv resistance of many of the powders, colors stay bright and vibrant longer.</p><p> texture selections range from smooth surfaces to a wrinkled or matte finish, plus rough textures designed for hiding surface imperfections. one 8 oz. bottle of powder (not included) covers the same area as 2-3 cans of spray paint, and clean-up is easy since you can simply sweep-up the over-sprayed powder. this powder can be reused as well if it's not contaminated. eastwood powders contain no environmentally harmful solvents so you can be planet-conscious as well. hotcoat powder coating requires a 5-10 psi compressed air source and a dedicated electric oven (or toaster oven).</p><p> <strong>powder coat in your own garage</strong></p><p> owning a dual-voltage electric powder coating gun means you can apply this technique to springs, valve covers, tri-flow radiators, vehicle body panels and anything else that needs a quality finish. one quick-change empty powder bottle is included and you can easily add more. the tool is designed to our exact specifications with a handheld activation switch, air inlet, removable diverter tip and grounding system.</p><p> new to powder coating? our youtube channel has a large playlist of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl0cabd4b165b0e6e4">powder coating

paintwork. perfect for pulling hail damage and most common parking lot and shopping cart mishaps.</p> <h3>why do you need an eastwood paintless dent removal kit?</h3> <ul> <li><b>saves money on costly dent repairs</b></li> <li><b>removes dents without damage to the paint</b></li> <li><b>enhances the look and increases the value of your vehicle</b></li> <li><b>comes with professional-use components</b></li> </ul> <p><b>note - not recommended for plastic bumper covers and trim pieces.</b></p> <h3>dent removal procedure</h3> <p>select the plastic pull button that best matches the size and shape of the dent to be pulled. generally, the very center of a dent is the best placement however larger dents may benefit from multiple pulls from different locations.</p> <p>using a non-permanent type marker or masking tape, trace a circle around the outside of the planned location of the pull button</p> <img alt="eastwood paintless dent repair removal kit" class="mobimage01" height="inherit" name="" src="https://www.eastwood.com/images/16145infoimage640_1.jpg" /> <p>immediately apply the face of the pull button to the previously outlined area and hold firmly in place for 10 to 15 seconds.</p> <p>wait several minutes for the heated glue to solidify then hook the slotted feature of either the levered puller or slide hammer shaft over the “t” feature of the pull button. operate the chosen pulling device to remove damage.</p> <img alt="eastwood paintless dent repair removal kit" class="mobimage01" height="inherit" name="" src="https://www.eastwood.com/images/16145infoimage640_2.jpg" /><br> <h3>pull button removal</h3> <p>fill the aluminum spray bottle 3/4 full of denatured alcohol (not included).</p> <p>apply the denatured alcohol liberally to the glue area while using the nylon scraper to gently wedge between the pull button and paint surface.</p> <p>carefully remove glue with provided nylon scraper. <b>note:</b> be careful if using on a vehicle that has been resprayed. the paint is not bonded as well as a factory finish and may lift.</p> <img alt="eastwood paintless dent repair removal kit"

cut 40-amp plasma cutter</h3> <p>the eastwood-designed plasma cutter is your smartest choice for making clean, fast cuts through steel, stainless steel or aluminum as thin as 24 gauge or as thick as 3/8-inch. compared to mechanical cutting, our versa cut 40 plasma cutter works significantly faster and makes curved and intricate cuts more easily and precisely. this is our best all-around plasma cutter and will handle most auto restoration, fabrication or repair work. the power, portability and affordability make it an essential tool for those who need to quickly slice through metal parts.</p> <strong>**</strong><strong>due to the high frequency start feature, we do not recommend using this machine on a cnc plasma table.**</strong></p><p> <h3>the eastwood versa cut 40 amp plasma cutter features:</h3> <ul type="disc"> <li><b>works with 110v or 220v ac input</b></li> <li><b>20' torch cable; 10' ground cable with clamp</b></li> <li><b>rated 40-amp output</b></li> <li><b>uses

coords="523,199,620,263" href="/images/email_images/brand/cms_content/tech_article_content/plasma40chart.pdf" target="_blank"> </map> <h3>premium metal cutting power</h3> <p>this innovative, affordable, plasma cutter was designed and developed by eastwood's own r&d staff and tested in-house on the same type of real-life projects you'll use it for. it doesn't matter where you need to work, because this plasma cutter's voltage-sensing technology lets you use either a 110v or 220v outlet with our adapter cord. it can cut through 1/8-thick metal on 110v power, enough for thin-gauge sheet metal and light fabrication. this portable plasma cutter is lightweight as well, weighing just 36 pounds so you can easily bring it along or plug it into a generator.</p> <p>inverter technology offers superior arc stability and plasma cutting power. a built-in pilot arc system allows for instant arc striking and ease of use when cutting rusty material and expanded metal. the internal moisture separator helps to ensure clean dry air gets to the torch to give you consistent results. with a duty cycle of 60 percent, this plasma cutter will cut at 40 amps for up to six minutes before it needs to cool. it also requires just 5 to 7 cfm of air at 60 psi, which can be supplied by common shop compressors. you can easily adjust the amperage and air pressure using the dials.</p> <h3>what is "plasma cutting"?</h3> <p>plasma cutting tools utilize a high-velocity jet of ionized gas (plasma) that conducts electricity from the torch of the plasma cutter to your metal workpiece. that directed plasma stream (about 30,000 degrees f) heats the work piece, converting the metal to molten slag. that high-velocity stream literally blows the molten metal away, leaving clean, precisely cut metal. with a 40-amp plasma cutter, you can do more in your body shop or race car garage.</p> <h3>ready-to-go cutter</h3> <p>the versa cut 40 plasma cutter comes with trafimet cb50 torch and 20-foot cable plus a 10-foot ground clamp assembly for safely getting around your work. it comes with our 100 percent customer satisfaction guarantee and free tech support by phone, email or the <a
