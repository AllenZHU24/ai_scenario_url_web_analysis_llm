this filter is a game changer for our family! where we live there is a lot of smoke from forest fires and having a son with lung damage finding a filter that can keep him healthy is crucial! this filter did just that. our home is so much healthier! easy to change and use! w allergy buyers club william hamer quietpure home the purchasing and shipping were a good experience. the quietpure home is rather large, but it cleans the air quickly and is fairly quiet. i like the automatic mode; just turn it on and leave it. i would recommend it. r allergy buyers club ron mieritz excellent air purifier i purchased a quietpure home air purifier nearly 5 years ago and have really been impressed with air quality and quietness of the tower. filters are good for about 6 months and reorder delivery usually takes about 1 working week. good product and has helped my severe allergies while cutting down on furniture dust and air particles! j allergy buyers club janet hundley great customer service i always enjoy ordering my air filters from this club. i like the savings a allergy buyers club amanda peitz excellent filter we have been using a water filter for the past year and it has made a huge difference, given we live in nyc, the water was always tasting a bit funky to me, however with this filter, we have been able to remove all the impurities and begin to taste water as is. however, the filter does not always seem to work fast, in the beginning of the installation, the water would come out quickly however within two months of use, the water filtering seem to slow down exponentially. very frustrating. however, we will continue to use this filter. j allergy buyers club jeri hegenbart they are awesome i have a quietpure air purifier that i bought a couple of years ago from allergy buyers club. it is a great fit for our home. it is so easy to order the replacement filters. s allergy buyers club sue nelson simply the best order was easy to create online. items we needed were available and in stock. order was delivered quickly and on time!

g allergy buyers club g.p. apartment air pollution solutions my apartment in s non-smoking building is surrounded by smoke belching neighbors, who ignore the no smoking policy and defy the landlord, who would rather ignore the smoking rather than enforce the policy and move to evict these air polluters. cigarette smoke, marijuana smoke and even crack smoke have wafted their way into my air space. fortunately, i found the allergy buyers club and purchased the aerus quietpure plus which resolved the smoke issue promptly. allergy buyers club has a great variety of devices at reasonable and competitive prices that will help you on your journey to make your life healthier and happier. i just recently added an aerus ecosphere air purifier for a music studio project i am working on. whether your kryptonite is smoke, dust, pet dander, pollen or fumes, the allergy buyers club can help you find relief and live a more enjoyable life. a allergy buyers club alara hillton my air cleaner several years back i bought the limited edition blue air multigas unit. since then i order the filters for it every 6 mos and it really helps me. the service on phone has been exceptional . i will miss hayden!
