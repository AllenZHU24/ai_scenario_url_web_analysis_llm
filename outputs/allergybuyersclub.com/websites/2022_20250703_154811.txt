it’s simple – hepa! these filters provide the highest level of vacuum-cleaner filtration available today. this level of filtration is imperative for folks suffering from allergies or asthma. hepa filtration removes 99.97% of all particles with a diameter of 0.3 microns or more and largely prevents these asthma and allergy triggers from being returned back into the air via the vacuum's exhaust. a sealed system also ensures that all air entering the vacuum passes through these filters first before being exhausted. this high-quality filtration system is critical for the management of allergy symptoms. we carry only top brand vacuum cleaners with quality hepa filtration and sealed body construction that have all passed our rigorous testing from our product experts. a hepa filter -- especially when used in a quality, bagged vacuum -- will provide the best level of household relief for allergy and asthma sufferers. for homes that have primarily wall to wall carpet, you might consider one of our upright vacuums. for homes that have primarily hard surface floors, you might consider one of our canister vacuums. for homes that you share with pets, you might consider our exclusive, sebo pet edition vacuums. see special offers on our best selling vacuum cleaners want expert help?
