so as not to blow the pollen particles back into the room through the exhaust system. you want particles safely trapped inside the vacuum cleaner. a dehumidifier will help in keeping your home and basement dry and healthy, helping prevent mold from forming and growing that can also trigger allergies. here are our best rated allergy air purifiers, hepa sealed vacuums and dehumidifiers to help you with your battle against spring allergies. want expert help?
