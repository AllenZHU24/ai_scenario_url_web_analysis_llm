we want you to be 100% delighted with your purchase from bella luna toys! if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you have a full 60 days to return your item for a full refund (less promotional discounts and shipping charges). returned items must be in new, unused condition with all original packaging intact and tags attached. please read our detailed returns page before sending your return. what payment methods do you accept? we accept visa, mastercard, discover, american express, and pay pal. do you charge sales tax? by law, we are only required to collect sales tax on orders shipped within the state of maine. how do i use a promotional code? you may enter your code in the checkout page in the box that appears above your subtotal. only one promotional code may be used per order. please note that if a promotional code causes your subtotal to drop below $99, your order will no longer qualify for free standard shipping. if you have questions or are having trouble with a coupon, please contact customer service at 888-438-1299 monday through friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. eastern time, or email us at support@bellalunatoys.com before completing your order. how do i use a gift card code? gift card codes are entered in the same field as discount codes on the checkout page. a gift card may be used in addition to a promotional code. the value of any unused balance on your gift card will be stored in our system, and the same code may be entered at a later date to redeem the remainder of your gift card why do you recommend paying with a credit card instead of a debit card online? if you have a choice, we always recommend using a credit card rather than a debit card when shopping online. because of the high incidence internet fraud, cards are often declined for reasons such as a billing address not matching or the wrong security code being entered. if one uses a debit card or prepaid card and the charge is declined, your bank may hold your funds until the transaction is settled, and we have no ability to release those funds for you. since debit cards draw from your actual funds, this can be problematic for customers. using a credit card will avoid these problems, since a declined charge will not impact your bank account balance. do you offer gift wrapping? we offer eco-friendly fsc-certified paper gift bags in charming designs from germany with a matching gift card for $4.95 per item. gift bags can be included for most products. if a product is ineligible for a gift bag, it will be noted as such in the product description. in some cases, small items can be combined in one gift bag. to inquire about this possibility, please place your order by phone at 1-888-438-1299, or email us before placing your order. can i place a special order?
