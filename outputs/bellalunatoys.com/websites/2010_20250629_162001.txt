they are beautiful and arrived here in plenty of time for my daughter's birthday party. i will bookmark your website, and we will order from you again in the future!” thank you! allyson “i ordered a few items for my daughter from bella luna this christmas and not only did my daughter love them, but sarah provided such great customer service i was blown away. when i purchase something i count the entire experience, not just price (although i found bella luna's prices to be competitive). i had spoken to so many non-helpful customer service representatives wiith other companies and speaking with sarah was such a breath of fresh air. she did her best to obtain the color that i wanted for a fairy doll for my daughter, and somehow got it to my home in time for xmas.” rhonda v.,ocean city, nj “i have really enjoyed talking with sarah over the phone and in e-mails. she cares about every customer. i really believe this!” viviane c.,nashville, tn “i wanted to say that i love bella luna toys! i placed an order before christmas and one part of the order went out of stock. sarah called me immediately *and* emailed me to let me know of the issue. we had the chance to exchange several emails throughout the course of a few weeks, and i just cannot say enough wonderful things about sarah and her company. they are such an incredible, delightful example of why i love to shop small businesses.” megan tietz, sorta crunchy blogsortacrunchy.typepad.com “i am a huge fan of bella luna toys! i was looking for play silks for my girls for christmas. sarah answered all my questions about what she thought would work best for the girls and her vast experience was invaluable. we ended up with play silks, gorgeous watercolors, paint brushes, watercolor paper and painting boards. she even walked me through the waldorf painting technique. every single item purchased has been an outstanding hit in our home. all of our pennies are carefully spent with the hope of receiving the greatest joy from the fewest "things." i can gladly say that we have never been more delighted with a purchase, and it was all thanks to sarah's time spent mulling over ideas with me during the hectic holiday season. needless to say, we are huge fans! if it's on her website, you can rest assured it with be worth the investment and yield returns in the smiling, giggling faces and hours of creative play that delights us all.” teresa g., germantown, tn what's new? wooden toys wooden vehicles wooden doll houses castle play more wooden toys baby toys | toddler toys push toys | pull toys stacking toys | nesting toys wooden baby toys more baby toys waldorf dolls waldorf dolls fairy dolls | gnome dolls doll accessories sarah's silks play silks dress up silk toys waldorf art supplies drawing | writing painting modeling waldorf crafts knitting fairy and gnome kits needle felting kits other kits and supplies waldorf books waldorf children's books | elsa beskow books books for parents kids music musical instruments kids songs | kids cds games cooperative games traditional games furniture | decor waldorf playstands play canopies | tents imaginative play house & kitchen play wooden play kitchens play kitchen accessories play food | wooden food cleaning toys wooden playhouse lunch time waldorf birthday natural outdoor toys outdoor toys kids gardening tools body and bath what's on sale? sign-up for giveaways, special offers and news!
