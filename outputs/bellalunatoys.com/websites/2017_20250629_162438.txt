we want you to be 100% delighted with your purchase from bella luna toys! if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you may return it within 90 days for a full refund (less promotional discounts and shipping charges). returned items must be in new, unused condition with all original packaging intact and tags attached. please read our detailed returns page before sending your return. what payment methods are accepted? we accept visa, mastercard, discover, american express, and pay pal. international customers are requested to use pay pal to check out. there is no need to have a pay pal account to check out with this method. a credit card may be used. will i have to pay sales tax on my order? by law, we are only required to collect sales tax on orders shipped within the state of maine. how do i use a promotional code? you may enter your code in the shopping cart at the time when you enter the shipping address. only one promotional code may be used at a time. please note that using a promotional code may cause the subtotal to drop below the $99 threshold for free shipping. coupons must be applied to your order at time of checkout in order to qualify for a promotion. promotional discounts cannot be applied once the order has been submitted. if you have questions or are having trouble with a coupon, please contact customer service at 888-438-1299 mon-fri from 9 am-5 pm est before completing your order. how do i use a gift card code? gift cards codes are entered in the same field as discount codes in the check out. gift cards may be used in addition to promotional codes. any unused balance will be stored in our system. why do you recommend paying with a credit card instead of a debit card online? we always recommend using a credit card, if possible, when shopping online. because of so much internet fraud, we have settings that decline orders based on certain filters, such as billing address verification. if one uses a debit card or prepaid card, and the charge is declined for any reason, the bank can hold your funds until the transaction is settled, and we have no ability to release those funds for you. since debit cards draw from actual funds, this can be problematic for customers. using a credit card will avoid these problems, since a declined charge will not impact your bank account balance. do you offer gift wrapping? most items may be gift wrapped. if a product can be gift wrapped, it will be noted as such in the product description. you may select gift wrapping in the check out, for $4.95 per item. in some cases, small items can be combined in one gift box for one gift wrap fee. to inquire about this possibility, please place your order by phone at 1-888-438-1299 or email us before placing your order. can i place a special order? don’t see what you’re looking for? please contact us by e-mail or phone and see if it can be special ordered! we are more than happy to do this when we can. please note, however, that since special ordered items are not normally carried in our inventory, they must be pre-paid and cannot be returned. promotional discounts may not be applied to special orders. do you accept purchase orders from schools and institutions? we are happy to accept purchase orders from schools and institutions. please send your purchase order by e-mail or fax to 1-207-209-4532. we will be happy to provide a w-9 if your organization requires one.note that our free shipping offer on orders over $99 only applies only to orders placed online or by phone and prepaid at the time of order. purchase orders that are invoiced and will be charged a shipping fee of 10% of the order total, with a minimum charge of $7.95. do you wholesale your merchandise to retailers?
