in this week's episode, i've compiled my top recommendations for the best parenting books. these books cover a wide range of age groups and topics. they were invaluable to me along my parenting journey, and one of them even inspired me to become a teacher! i want to hear from you! please let me know in the comment section if there are any must-have parenting books on your shelf. shop books for parents books parenting share tweet pin ‚Üê older post newer post ‚Üí comments enjoyed you class on wool soup project. great for children and elderly peopleüëç johanne rousseau on april 20, 2020 thank you for your parenting book suggestions! i recommend strong & kind by korie robertson. melissa koffler on february 27, 2020 hi sarah! i‚Äôm so happy to have found you last year. i would like to know what i can read or learn to help my daughter find her voice. it‚Äôs as if she‚Äôs afraid to speak her mind or be firm with her decisions. she‚Äôs a bit of a follower and she doesn‚Äôt really like that. for example, in the playground another lite girl of same age roll my daughter to take her gloves off and proceeded to pull one glove off my child, to which my kid then took the other off herself. later back in our car my kid told me what happened and that she didn‚Äôt want to take her gloves off but that the girl told her to and she didn‚Äôt like that but did it anyway. my heart sank. i was happy that she shared this, i told her it‚Äôs ok to tell someone no. my daughter clammed up and then changed the subject. ugh. i was mortified i didn‚Äôt know what else to say without nagging and she seemed uncomfortable or embarrassed. help! how can i help her? i want to raise a strong child but in the process i don‚Äôt want to be so dominant that she‚Äôs afraid to find and use her voice. thank you for all you do here and i hope to hear back from you. my daughter just turned 4yrs old. ej on february 27, 2020 leave a comment name email message please note, comments must be approved before they are published sunday with sarah rss tags autumn babies baking with children books breastfeeding celebrations christmas education fall favorite toys festivals holiday holidays homemade gifts martinmas motherhood news parenting q&a recipes toddlers tutorial valentine's day viewer q+a waldorf waldorf classroom winter breastfeeding q+a make a felt woven heart basket about us about bella luna toys our rewards program a note from sarah what are waldorf toys? retail store meet our staff sarah's "moon child" blog customer reviews customer service contact us shipping returns + exchanges faqs buy a gift card visit our sister site at oompa organic toys more info my account wish list gift registry privacy policy terms of use employment opportunities newsletter join to get special offers, free giveaways, and once-in-a-lifetime deals. ¬© bella luna toys 2020 twitter facebook instagram pinterest youtube american express american express apple pay apple pay diners club diners club discover discover elo elo google pay google pay jcb jcb mastercard master paypal paypal venmo venmo visa visa
