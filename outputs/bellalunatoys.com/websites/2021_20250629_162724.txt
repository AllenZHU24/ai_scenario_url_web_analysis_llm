we love these brands as much as our customers do! as authorized retailers, we work with all our vendors to ensure our pricing is in-line with their msrp, and our sales can match their manufacturing capabilities. limited stock, lengthy restock lead times, decreased availability and brand integrity also contribute to the exclusion of ostheimer, fagus, and sawdust & rainbows from the star coins rewards redemption. all purchases of these items will earn star coins and are deposited in your account when the order ships. we currently cannot allow star coins to be redeemed on items from the following brands: ostheimer, fagus, and sawdust & rainbows. gift cards are also exempt from the star coins program (see gift card question above for more). due to the limited stock and our longstanding relationships with these vendors, we respect their requests to be excluded from certain discounts or promotions on our website. how do i redeem my star coins?
