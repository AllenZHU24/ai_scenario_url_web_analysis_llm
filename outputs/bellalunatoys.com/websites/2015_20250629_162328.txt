what is there not to love about bella luna toys? it is so easy to see that sarah puts her heart and soul into her work with passion! there is nothing stale about her ever-changing, lovely waldorf-inspired store! beautiful pictures grace her site; inspiring, natural items in a cascade of wonderful categories which are all easy to see and navigate; youtube videos; occasional giveaways and discounts, and second best of all only to her store, is her lovely blog in which she shares so many helpful tidbits for us mamas navigating our children’s present and future. actually, the very best of all is that sarah offers the best customer service there ever was!" kristin w.via living crafts blog “thank you for being so appreciative of our business. it is the simple, personal note you wrote on our last receipt that makes me happy to support your business.” monique r. woodstock, ct “i recently ordered paints and watercolor paper from you, and i'm so happy you recommended the paper!

much aloha!” abigail s.kilauea, hi “the thing i learn every time i visit bella luna toys is that its owner, sarah baldwin, is as real, natural, beautiful and nourishing for children (and parents!) as all the marvelous things she sells there. this is pure joy to all who know her and who visit her website.” beverly s.,camden, me “i received the flower fairy doll today...what a wonderful surprise! thank you for the excellent customer service - really, first class. the doll is just adorable; i'm sure avery will love it.” ana - from florida “i wanted to thank you for something beautiful which came out of a purchase i made. last autumn, our beloved friend died suddenly and tragically, leaving behind his dear wife adored eight-year-old daughter. it has been a very difficult year, filled with sorrow and questions about how best to mourn and proceed. around the anniversary of his death, our family sent his wife and daughter a packet of paper and instructions for folding window stars, and a small, heart-shaped beeswax candle, reminding them that they're in our hearts. this afternoon, i received a photo from her, along with a note. she had spent the weekend praying and meditating, and the photo showed the precious heart candle lit on a tray with fruits and sweets, surrounded by pictures of our deceased friend and their daughter. you can't imagine how much healing one little candle and one packet of paper have brought to so many people. thank you for being the sort of company i can turn to in order to find something to send when words fail me.” nancy v. “thank you for shipping the bubble wands so quickly! they are beautiful and arrived here in plenty of time for my daughter's birthday party. i will bookmark your website, and we will order from you again in the future!” thank you! allyson “i just wanted to let you know that i had a wonderful shopping experience through you. this was my first purchase at your site, and not only is your site easy to use, but the selection is great and the prices are very reasonable. i managed to get a lovely toy for a one year old's birthday, and the quality was beyond expectation. to add the icing on the cake, i got my shipping upgraded and my items made it here in plenty of time. what a pleasant surprise! thank you for providing this site for my waldorf/quality toy needs, and expect me to recommend you to my friends and shop from you again!” jess p.spring grove, pa “i ordered a few items for my daughter from bella luna this christmas and not only did my daughter love them, but sarah provided such great customer service i was blown away. when i purchase something i count the entire experience, not just price (although i found bella luna's prices to be competitive). i had spoken to so many non-helpful customer service representatives with other companies and speaking with sarah was such a breath of fresh air. she did her best to obtain the color that i wanted for a fairy doll for my daughter, and somehow got it to my home in time for xmas.” rhonda v.ocean city, nj "wow – what customer service! i’m truly impressed! thank you for finding the lavender outfit for the waldorf heavy baby doll, and for the extra work to find that color for my daughter. you will make one little girl very happy on christmas morning. i can’t express enough how appreciative i am for all your time and customer service.  you’ve been absolutely wonderful! thank you, thank you, thank you!" toni r.windsor, ca “i wanted to say that i love bella luna toys! i placed an order before christmas and one part of the order went out of stock. sarah called me immediately *and* emailed me to let me know of the issue. we had the chance to exchange several emails throughout the course of a few weeks, and i just cannot say enough wonderful things about sarah and her company. they are such an incredible, delightful example of why i love to shop small businesses.” megan tietz, sorta crunchy blogsortacrunchy.typepad.com “i am a huge fan of bella luna toys! i was looking for play silks for my girls for christmas. sarah answered all my questions about what she thought would work best for the girls and her vast experience was invaluable. we ended up with play silks, gorgeous watercolors, paint brushes, watercolor paper and painting boards. she even walked me through the waldorf painting technique. every single item purchased has been an outstanding hit in our home. all of our pennies are carefully spent with the hope of receiving the greatest joy from the fewest "things." i can gladly say that we have never been more delighted with a purchase, and it was all thanks to sarah's time spent mulling over ideas with me during the hectic holiday season. needless to say, we are huge fans! if it's on her website, you can rest assured it with be worth the investment and yield returns in the smiling, giggling faces and hours of creative play that delights us all.” teresa g., germantown, tn free shipping on orders over $99 what's new? party favors seasonal toys natural toys - baby & toddler push toys | pull toys puzzles soft toys | organic plush toys stacking toys | nesting toys swings | babies & toddlers wooden baby toys wooden toddler toys wooden toys wooden toy vehicles wooden blocks wooden puzzles ride-on toys wooden rocking toys castle play more wooden toys ostheimer figures family farm animals forest animals zoo animals fairy tales | knights trees, landscapes, buildings flower children christmas | nativity gift boxed sets wooden doll houses wooden dollhouses dollhouse dolls wooden dollhouse furniture waldorf dolls waldorf dolls fairy dolls | gnome dolls doll accessories sarah's silks play silks dress up silk toys waldorf art supplies drawing | writing painting modeling waldorf crafts doll making fairy and gnome kits knitting felting kits paper crafts sewing weaving and other crafts waldorf books waldorf books for children waldorf books for parents storytelling kid's music musical instruments song books | kid's cds games cooperative games other board games traditional games learning toys furniture | decor waldorf playstands waldorf wooden furniture play canopies | tents growth charts kids night lights imaginative play cooking house & kitchen play wooden play kitchens play kitchen accessories play food | wooden food cleaning toys | house play lunch time waldorf birthday natural outdoor toys outdoor toys gardening with children puppets beeswax candles bed, body, and bath waldorf home gift certificates what's on sale? secure shopping customer service 1-888-438-1299 copyright 2002-2014, bella luna toys. bella luna toys also recommends: oompa - wooden toys |   site map |   terms of use |   privacy policy |   shipping |   returns |   resources |   contact ﻿ ﻿ ﻿
