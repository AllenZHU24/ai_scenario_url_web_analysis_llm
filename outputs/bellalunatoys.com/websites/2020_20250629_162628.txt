unfortunately, we cannot apply discounts to orders that have been placed before the start of a sale. during a sale, prices are as marked, while supplies last. we do not offer rainchecks. one-day or multi-day sale prices cannot be applied retroactively to prior purchases. star coins rewards cannot be applied retroactively. what kind of guarantee do you offer? we want you to be entirely delighted with your purchase from bella luna toys! if, upon receipt of your order, you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you have a full 30 days to return your item for a full refund (less promotional discounts and shipping charges). returned items must be in new, unused condition with all original packaging intact and tags attached. please read our detailed returns page before sending your return. please note that while wooden toys are far more durable than most plastic toys, they can sometimes break. while wooden toys generally last for years when treated with care, our toys are not guaranteed against breakage through play and usage. the lovely thing about wood is that it can usually be repaired with carpenter's glue such as elmer's, then enjoyed for many more years. what payment methods do you accept? we accept visa, mastercard, discover, american express, and pay pal. how do i use a promotional code? you may enter your code in the checkout page in the box that appears above your subtotal. only one promotional code may be used per order. please note that if a promotional code causes your subtotal to drop below $99, your order will no longer qualify for free standard shipping. also note that star coins points cannot be combined with use of a promotional code. grimm’s spiel & holz, grapat, ostheimer, milton and goose, and wishbone products are not eligible for discounts by redeeming star coins. bella luna toys e-gift cards are exempt from the program. for more information visit the faq section of our rewards page. if you have questions or are having trouble with a coupon or star coins, please contact customer service at 1-888-438-1299 monday through friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. eastern time, or email us at support@bellalunatoys.com before completing your order. how do i use a gift card code? gift card codes are entered in the same field as discount codes on the checkout page. a gift card may be used in addition to a promotional code. the value of any unused balance on your gift card will be stored in our system, and the same code may be entered at a later date to redeem the remainder of your gift card. do you charge sales tax? if you are shipping your order to any of the states below, applicable sales tax will be calculated at checkout according to each state's laws. if your billing address is in a state where bella luna toys is not required to collect sales tax, please be aware that sales tax will be calculated on your order if shipped to any of the following states: california, colorado, florida, illinois, massachusetts, maine, michigan, new york, pennsylvania, texas, virginia, washington if you are placing an order for a tax-exempt organization or school, please provide a copy of your 1023 form prior to placing your order by emailing a pdf attachment to support@bellalunatoys.com or faxing a copy to (207) 209-4532. if we do not have a 1023 on file, applicable sales tax will be collected and may not be refundable. we will notify you when your tax-exempt account has been created and you can then place your tax-free order online. why do you recommend paying with a credit card instead of a debit card online? if you have a choice, we always recommend using a credit card rather than a debit card when shopping online. because of the high incidence internet fraud, cards are often declined for reasons such as a billing address not matching or the wrong security code being entered. if you use a debit card or prepaid card and the charge is declined, your bank may hold your funds until the transaction is settled, and we have no ability to release those funds for you. using a credit card will avoid this problem, since a declined charge will not impact your bank account balance. do you offer gift wrapping? we offer eco-friendly fsc-certified paper gift bags in charming designs from germany with a matching gift card for $4.95 per item. gift bags can be included for most products; if not, that will be noted in the product description. in some cases, small items can be combined in one gift bag. to inquire about this possibility, please place your order by phone at 1-888-438-1299, or email us before placing your order. can i place a special order? don’t see what you’re looking for? please contact us by e-mail or phone and see if it can be special ordered. we'd love to help you find exactly what you're looking for! please note that since special ordered items are not normally carried in our inventory, they must be pre-paid and cannot be returned. promotional discounts may not be applied to special orders. we regret that we are unable to accept special orders during the months of november and december. do you accept purchase orders from schools and institutions? we are happy to accept purchase orders from schools and institutions. please send your purchase order by e-mail or fax to 1-207-209-4532. we will be happy to provide a w-9 if your organization requires one. note that our free shipping offer on orders over $99 only applies to orders placed online or by phone and paid at the time of order. purchase orders that are invoiced will be charged a shipping fee of 10% of the order total, with a minimum charge of $10.95. if your organization is tax-exempt, please provide a copy of form 1023 for our records if your order is shipping to any of the states where we collect sales tax as required by law.

if you refuse a shipment from the shipping carrier, you will be responsible for any shipping costs incurred from returning the package to us, which will be deducted from your refund. how can i change my order or cancel it after it has been placed? in the event that you want to make changes to your order or cancel it, please contact us as soon as possible after placing your order. here at bella luna toys we pride ourselves on processing and shipping orders quickly, so cancelations and changes are not always possible, especially during the months of november and december. if your order has already been processed, you have the option to refuse the package when it is delivered and it will be returned to us. once we receive your returned package, we will refund your method of payment, less any fee incurred from returning the shipment. my tracking number shows my order was delivered, but i cannot locate the package. what can i do? if the tracking information indicates that your order was delivered, check everywhere--occasionally carriers leave deliveries with neighbors, building managers, or places such as your porch, garage, or even behind bushes. check with all household members. once tracking shows that a package has been successfully delivered to the shipping address provided by the customer, bella luna toys is not responsible for lost or stolen packages. how can i protect my package from loss, damage or theft? bella luna toys is proud to now partner with route, the leader in package protection insurance. by selecting route+ at checkout, your order will be protected from damage, loss,* or theft. once a checkout is complete and an order has been placed, route protection insurance is non-refundable. in the unfortunate case that your order never arrives or is damaged upon arrival, you can easily file a claim with route and receive a replacement or refund. with an increase in reports of package theft, we strongly recommend that you choose route+ package protection at checkout, especially if you live in an area where “porch piracy” is a problem. * filing a claim with route if your tracking number shows that your package was delivered, but you have not received it, you must allow 5 days after the “delivery date” before filing a claim for loss, and no later than 15 days. claims for packages presumed to be lost in transit (where the status is not "delivered") must be filed after 7 days (20 days for international) and within 30 days from the last checkpoint. if the tracking information indicates that your package was returned to us, please email support@bellalunatoys.com or phone us at 888-438-1299. your shipping address may have been entered incorrectly, the driver may have unsuccessfully attempted delivery, or the carrier may have mis-delivered it. the postage fee to reship is the responsibility of the customer. can you send me a print catalog?
