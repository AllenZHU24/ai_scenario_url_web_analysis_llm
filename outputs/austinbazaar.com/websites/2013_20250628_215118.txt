what sort of “problems/concerns” might delay my order? if we are unable to verify your shipping address or if the item you selected sold out before we could fulfill your order, we might not be able to ship your item(s) on the same day. in those cases, a member of our staff will contact you immediately to work with you on resolving the issue and expediting your order in a timely fashion. what is the two-day "order processing" time? for further information, please see our order processing explanation here. do you ship to p.o. boxes? you may include a p.o. box as your shipping address but be aware that some large items and any order totaling 50 lbs or more requires a residential address (not a p.o. box). do you ship to apo/fpo addresses? unfortunately, we do not ship to apo/fpo addresses. if you are located on a military base either within or outside the u.s., please provide a residential address in the united states for your order and have the shipment forwarded to you upon receipt. will you require a signature for delivery? orders for items with a total value greater than $500 usd will be sent with "signature required" service. how can i estimate my fees for expedited shipping before i submit my order? you can estimate your shipping charge as follows: select the item(s) you would like to purchase add to cart enter the zip code of the shipping address select delivery method you will then receive an estimated shipping charge. what shipping method will you use to ship my order if i select the “free shipping” offer? while we do offer expedited shipping methods, like overnight and 2-day service, if you opt to take advantage of our free shipping offer, your item(s) will be shipped via the most cost-effective method available to us. if the item you selected is lightweight, like a set of strings or a gig bag, it might ship via usps, but any item weighing more than a pound will typically ship via ups. most items ship from our austin, texas, facility and will arrive in 3-7 business days. in any case, you will receive a tracking number via email as soon as one is assigned. if you have special requirements or need to know more in advance of your order’s departure, don’t hesitate to call or send an email. why is expedited shipping so expensive? most musical instruments are bulky, so faster shipping methods might offer rates that can be higher. please review the shipping rates carefully before placing your order. once an order has been processed we cannot change the delivery method. do you ship to hawaii or alaska? we currently do not ship to alaska or hawaii. some exceptions apply, so contact us if you live outside the lower 48 states. while we do make exceptions, the free shipping promotion applies to orders being shipped within the continental united states. do you ship to locations outside the u.s.? we ship to canada, australia, and the u.k. via ups for select products**. the free shipping offer doesn't apply to these orders. although brokerage fees are included in the shipping amount paid when you submit your order, please note that you will be responsible for any customs duties/fees upon delivery. if duties/fees are refused upon delivery, we will refund product value upon receipt of your item less any additional fees incurred to have your shipment returned to our facility. if you have any questions regarding our international shipping service, please do not hesitate to contact us via email or by phone. **we are not able to ship shure, fender, guild, jackson, gretsch, squier, and evh products outside of the u.s. for any further inquiries please contact us at customerservice@austinbazaar.com. return to the help portal *orders in texas are subject to sales tax. welcome to austin bazaar. from orchestral and wind instruments to guitars and amplifiers, we have an extensive selection of music instruments from trusted name brands like fender, yamaha and martin guitars. in addition, we can supply gear for all your professional audio needs, including microphones, pas, mixers, computer interfaces, and portable recorders from industry-leading brands like casio, korg, m-audio, and shure. luna ukuleles and guitars boss pedals and guitar effects zoom digital recorders gretsch guitars and basses squier guitars and basses cad microphones hohner harmonicas and accordions takamine acoustic guitars esp electric guitars and basses marshall amplifiers products new arrivals category index product index information about us blog policies returns & exchanges privacy policy returns policy shipping policy terms & conditions my account order status sign in view cart help instrument setup contact us orders faqs © 2013 austin bazaar           shopping cart software by volusion (your shopping cart is empty)
