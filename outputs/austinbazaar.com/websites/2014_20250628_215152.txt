next » looking for a new guitar? austin bazaar carries all of your favorites. if you aren't sure where to start, read on for the run-down. we have pro advice for helping you choose a guitar which is best suited for your needs. what we have our stock of acoustic guitars come in a variety of sizes and finishes. the acoustic guitar offers a sound like no other. it is available in a multitude of styles, from the traditional 6 string to the more challenging 12 string guitar. the nylon 6 string guitar features the warm, rich tones that can be heard in classical music, unlike its steel string counterpart, which produces a brighter tone. for those looking for more of a challenge, playing the 12 string guitar produces a natural chorus effect, and can be heard in the blues or folk genres of music. the acoustic-electric guitars that we carry combine beauty and power for versatile sound. featuring beautiful, solid wood craftmanship with powerhouse electronics, you can be sure that you'll get gorgeous tone that can be amplified to suite your needs with an acoustic-electric guitar. if you prefer something a little more edgy, austin bazaar also carries a wide variety of electric guitars with all the pickups and colors you could imagine. the electric guitar combines beauty and power for versatile sound. the pickups on this type of guitar transfer the sound of a resonating guitar string to an amplifier. single-coil pickups produce a thin, transparent sound, while double-coil pickups (also known as humbuckers) produce a warm, smooth sound. tonewoods most styles of guitars come in a variety of tonewoods and sizes. common examples of tonewoods are maple, alder, and mahogany. denser woods create flatter, thicker tones while lightweight woods produce brighter tones. when deciding on the tonewood of a guitar, sound is generally considered the most important factor to take into account. the perfect fit there are many different sizes of guitars, commonly referenced by fraction (e.g. 1/2 size) or measurement (e.g. 38"). most adults will want a full size guitar for maximum comfort and playability. a full-size guitar is 41" in length. while less common, 7/8 size or 38" guitars are sometimes favorable for their compact size and shorter neck. these make excellent travel guitars. they are also more playable for guitarists with petite builds, small hands, or children. smaller guitars like 1/2 size (25 inch) are recommended for children. from scaled down versions of the electric guitar for the littlest musicians to full size solid-mahogany acoustic guitars featuring legendary craftsmanship, you can be sure that we have the right size, shape & color for any budding musician, and you don't have to be a kid! austin bazaar carries a large selection of left-handed guitars for those of you who don't want to learn how to play a guitar upside down. shape & style as far as shapes go, there are a multitude to choose from! for acoustic guitars, traditional body shape has an symmetrical upper and lower bout. other options include a cutaway style, which gives easier access to high range frets. dreadnoughts tend to be larger and more squared off than classical or parlor guitars. they are also the most popular style of acoustic or acoustic-electric guitar. as far as electric guitars go, stratocasters and telecasters are the most popular with top brands like fender. gretsch guitars such as the electromatic are known for having a generally wide lower bout. if you want something truly unique, esp & dean electric guitars are popular for
