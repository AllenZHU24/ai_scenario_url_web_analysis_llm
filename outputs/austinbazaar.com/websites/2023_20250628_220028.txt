 you may include a p.o. box as your shipping address but be aware that some large items and any order totaling 50 lbs or more requires a residential address (not a p.o. box). do you ship to apo/fpo addresses?  unfortunately, we do not ship to apo/fpo addresses. if you’re located on a military base, within or outside the u.s., please provide a residential address in the united states for your order and have the shipment forwarded to you upon receipt. will you require a signature for delivery?  orders for items with a total value greater than $500 usd will be sent with "signature required" service. how can i estimate my fees for expedited shipping before i submit my order?  you can estimate your shipping charge as follows: select the item(s) you would like to purchase add to cart enter the zip code of the shipping address select delivery method you will then receive an estimated shipping charge. what shipping method will you use to ship my order if i select the “free shipping” offer?   while we do offer expedited shipping methods, like overnight and 2-day service, if you opt to take advantage of our free shipping offer, your item(s) will be shipped via the most cost-effective method available to us. if the item you selected is lightweight, like a set of strings or a gig bag, it might ship via usps, but any item weighing more than a pound will typically ship via fedex. most items ship from our austin, texas, facility and will arrive in 3-7 business days. in any case, you will receive a tracking number via email as soon as one is assigned. if you have special requirements or need to know more in advance of your order’s departure, don’t hesitate to call or send an email. why is expedited shipping so expensive?  most musical instruments are bulky, so faster shipping methods might offer rates that can be higher. please review the shipping rates carefully before placing your order. once an order has been processed we cannot change the delivery method. do you ship to hawaii or alaska? yes, we now offer shipping to alaska and hawaii (standard fedex shipping rates apply). while we do make some exceptions, our free shipping promotion applies only to orders being shipped within the contiguous united states. do you ship to locations outside the u.s.? austin bazaar does not currently offer international shipping. for any further inquiries please contact us at customerservice@austinbazaar.com × don't miss a beat! sign up for special offers ,deals, gear reviews & more! email address categories guitars amplifiers and effects ukuleles pianos and keyboards pro audio drums and percussion accessories buy with prime quick links home harmonica instructional guide lessons my account gift certificates sale open-box/used gear blog faqs fender play loyalty program site info about us return policy shipping policy payment options contact us terms and conditions privacy policy what's new?
