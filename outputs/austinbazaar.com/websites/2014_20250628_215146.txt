bazaar on december 23, 2014 if you're tight on space, money or height, a little martin guitar may be just what you're looking for. the best part about little martins (aside from portability) is that these travel guitars manage to produce some powerful tones despite their size. let's be real though - what else would you expect from a martin? read on to find out if the little martin is right for you. little martin guitars may be smaller than full-size dreadnoughts, but they still pack an acoustic punch. the little martin is perfect for wander-lusting musicians, students or those with only a small amount of room for a guitar. these are also a more affordable option for those who enjoy the classic look and sound that martin is known for, but can't quite afford the price tag. how small is small? these travel guitars measure in with a total of 20 frets (14 clear of the body) and a scale length of 23." this is the perfect size for traveling, and for all of you guitar purists out there - a little martin won't ever be mistaken for a ukulele!materials although some travel guitars from other brands can't quite measure up to their full-size counterparts, there is no compromising on sound or craftsmanship with the little martin series. the martin lx1 and martin lx1e feature solid sitka spruce tops while the martin lxm has a spruce hpl top. all three versions come with a rosewood fretboard. little martin necks are constructed from rust-stained stratabond, which has more strength than a typical wood neck. this is great for traveling as it will lengthen the lifespan of the guitar and help to prevent warping. which travel companion will you choose? the little martin lx1 acoustic guitar and little martin lx1e acoustic-electric guitar have solid sitka spruce tops, and the lx1e features fishman ion-t electronics for superior amplified sound. the little martin lxm acoustic guitar has a textured spruce hpl top and a herringbone-style gold and black rosette that sticks out from the crowd. need help choosing a guitar? email us at sales@austinbazaar.com or call 800-511-1322. acoustic guitarbuying guidetravel guitarlittle martinmartin view comments steel strings vs nylon
