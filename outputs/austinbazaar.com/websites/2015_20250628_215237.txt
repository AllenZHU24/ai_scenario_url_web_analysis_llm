note that we will not accept returns on products damaged due to use of an inappropriate power supply. electronic products sold by austin bazaar require 120 volts of power (i.e., 120v/60hz) as is standard for north america. if you live elsewhere, you’ll need both plug and power converters to avoid damaging products purchased from austin bazaar. austin bazaar does not sell converters of any kind - however, they are inexpensive and can be found at most electronic stores. voltage standards vary by country and many, including australia and much of europe, call for 230 volts. for any further
