much will it cost to ship my order?a: free shipping for all orders shipped within the u.s excluding alaska and hawaii. for alaska and hawaii, standard fedex shipping rates apply. q: what shipping method will you use to ship my order if i select the “free shipping” option?a: most orders will ship “ground” (3-5 business days) via fedex but smaller packages (weighing 2 lbs or less) will ship usps. most items ship from our austin, texas, facility and will arrive in 3-7 business days. in any case, you will receive a tracking number via email as soon as one is assigned. if you have special requirements or need to know more in advance of your order’s departure, don’t hesitate to call or send an email. q: how can i estimate my fees for expedited shipping before i submit my order?a: you can estimate your shipping charge as follows: select the item(s) you would like to purchase add to cart enter the zip code of the shipping address select delivery method you will then receive an estimated shipping charge. or, you can call our customer service team and ask for a general shipping quote. q: what is the two day "order processing" time?a: austin bazaar is dedicated to sending your order in the fastest and most efficient way possible. when an order is placed it must first be processed. that processing time is different than the shipping time. processing time will typically take about 1 business day depending on the time the order was placed. business days are considered monday through friday (excluding holidays). shipping, including any expedited method, is in addition to the processing time. customers are always welcome and encouraged to call our customer service team for a more accurate delivery date.q: what is the difference between “order processing” time and "shipping time"? a: order processing time is the time from which the order was placed to when we receive the order and communicated with the appropriate warehouse to ship. “shipping time” is from when the warehouse has shipped the order to the time it arrives to the customer and/or requested destination. q: will you require a signature for delivery?a: orders for items with a total value greater than $500 usd will be sent with "signature required" service. q: why is expedited shipping so expensive?a: expedited shipping is more expensive since it’s going against the standard ship time and the customer needs the package urgently which means the customer will receive the package in half or less of the standard 3-5 day delivery estimate. please note that all orders are shipped on business days (mon-fri) this means if you choose any method of expedited shipping on a friday after 1p.m. through sunday your order will not ship until the following business day (monday.) q: do you ship to p.o. boxes?a: yes but be aware that some large items and any order totaling 7 lbs or more requires a residential address (not a p.o. box). in this event, a customer representative will contact you for a residential home address via email or phone call. q: do you ship to apo/fpo addresses?a: unfortunately, we do not ship to apo/fpo addresses. if you are located on a military base (within or outside the u.s.) please provide a residential shipping address in the united states for your order and arrange to have the shipment forwarded to you upon receipt.q: do you ship to hawaii or alaska?a: yes, we now offer shipping to alaska and hawaii (standard fedex shipping rates apply). while we do make some exceptions, our free shipping promotion applies only to orders being shipped within the contiguous united states. q: do you ship to locations outside the u.s.?a: sorry, we currently do not offer shipping outside the u.s. questions about my order q: what is your return policy?a: view our full return
