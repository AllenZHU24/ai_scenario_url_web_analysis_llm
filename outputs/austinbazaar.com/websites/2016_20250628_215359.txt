casio privia pro px-560 - a powerful digital piano for the stage or studio posted by austin bazaar on february 23, 2016 the casio privia pro px-560 digital piano is the newest addition to casio's popular privia line. aside from it's striking blue finish, the px560 boasts several new technical features that set it apart from other models in the series. read on to find out more! after reviewing the features of the new px-560, it is clear that it was designed with performers and sound engineers in mind. this 88-key piano workstation is a completely new addition to the privia series rather than an update to an older model (as was the case with the px-160, px-760 and px-860 that were released in 2015). keep it simple - or explore the possibilities the px-560's large, intuitive 5.3" touch interface makes it easy to use while still providing advanced features for those who want to delve deeper into music composition and live performance. this powerful digital piano borrows hex layer technology from the px-5s, casio's flagship keyboard synthesizer. hex layers can consist of up to 4 zones and 14 layers, and can be edited in realtime with 3 control knobs and a modulation wheel - providing a veritable sonic playground for producers and composers. these are exciting additions to an already powerful piano that features a tri-sensor scaled hammer action keyboard as well as casio’s multi-dimensional air (acoustic and intelligent resonator) sound source. these features make for an incredibly realistic grand piano sound and playing experience at the basis of this advanced instrument. tones, rhythms and presets along with these massive splits and layers, the px-560 boasts 550 instrument tones from a huge variety of genres and instruments, which can be further enhanced by dsp effects. it includes 220 onboard rhythms to give you your very own "backing band" for live performance, or create up to 30 of your own user rhythms by combining basslines, drum beats and more. you can also create 100 of your own music presets (which encompass a rhythm, tones, effects, and built-in chord progressions) making this piano. built-in recording options if you want to record your compositions or song ideas, the px-560 includes two built-in recording options - a 17-track midi recorder with editing features, and a usb audio recorder that creates audio files onto a usb memory stick. you can even add external instruments to your recordings via the px-560's audio inputs. the possibilities are endless! at home on stage or in the studio this 26-lb keyboard is lightweight enough to be supported on stage by a folding keyboard stand, or you can choose to upgrade to a more stationary casio cs-67 furniture style stand. you can also add the optional sp-33 3-pedal unit for a realistic piano experience with soft, sostenuto and damper pedals. the px-560's built-in speaker system has more than enough power to entertain at home, and its 1/4" outputs and inputs provide easy connectivity to pa systems if needed. on top of all that, the px-560 has the same great educational features as the other privia pianos, including duet mode (splits they keyboard into two equal ranges for teacher and student to play the same pieces side by side), two front-panel mounted headphone jacks (for silent practice sessions), and classroom mode, which allows each side to be sent to an individual audio output. these features make this model compatible with the most popular third party piano lab systems and it is a great choice for private lessons as well.save big with piano bundles the px-560 is an exciting new addition to the privia family, providing both form and function to performers and producers alike. if you do choose to purchase your privia px-560 with a stand or bench, we encourage you to check out some of our most popular casio px-560 bundle packages below to save big on essential accessories. shop all casio px-560 bundles >>> need help choosing a piano? call 800-511-1322 or email sales@austinbazaar.com casiopriviadigital pianospx-560review please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus. comments powered by disqus recent posts » yamaha fg700 vs fg800 acoustic guitars - what's new » ukulele wood comparison - different ukulele wood types » casio privia pro px-560 - a powerful digital piano for the stage or studio » fender jimi hendrix signature stratocaster guitar » shure sm57 vs sm58 microphones - what's the difference? buying guides » acoustic guitar buying guide » ukulele buying guide » microphone buying guide » digital piano buying guide see all buying guides » gift guides » gifts for guitarists » gifts for ukulele lovers » gifts for pianists » gifts under $50 » gifts for kids see all gift guides » featured video see all videos » × quick links pages home sale blog faqs shipping policyreturn policypayment optionsnew instrument setupbuying guidesloyalty programmusic educator discounts about us contact us loyalty program what's new? yamaha fg700 vs fg800 acoustic guitars - what's new for years the yamaha fg700s guitar has stood out as one of the top … ukulele wood comparison - different ukulele wood types are you wondering which ukulele tonewoods are best? what is … casio privia pro px-560 - a powerful digital piano for the stage or studio the casio privia pro px-560 digital piano is the newest addition … subscribe sign up for for special offers, gear reviews and exclusive deals!
