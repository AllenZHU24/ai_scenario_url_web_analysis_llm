try getting a sample before buying any paint to see if the color will work well in your space. 2. balance you can design a colorful room without it overwhelming you and your guests. the trick is to keep the colors balanced. choose two or three primary colors, then add additional colors as accents. 3. mood do you want to decorate a room that helps you feel relaxed? happy? energized? colors can impact your mood, which is why certain colors work better in the bedroom, kitchen or living room than in others. (here’s a helpful guide for choosing colors based on mood.) 4. risk factor if you often play it safe, maybe it’s time to shake things up. get that bright red loveseat you’ve been eyeing or design an accent wall with colorful wallpaper. on the other hand, if every color decision you make is bold, it might be time to go for a more neutral shade. 5. cohesiveness do you want each room to have a similar color scheme, or would you prefer to include different colors in each room? either way can work – you just have to decide which style you like better. 6. room size dark colors work well in larger spaces because they tend to make a room look smaller. when working with a small room, on the other hand, choose lighter shades as your primary colors and then decorate with dark accents. 7. personal preference what colors do you like best? in the end, what’s most important is that you feel at home in your space; decorating with your favorite colors is one way to do that. colorcolor palettecolor schemeliving roomprimary color please share this tweet like plus one pin it share wendy weinert wendy weinert is an hgtv addict and avid diyer. when not working on a craft project, as an interior design blogger and enthusiast, she is passionately helping people beautify their environment by providing insightful advice and inspiration. related posts the perfect holiday open house: decorating made easy hosting an open house for the holidays this year? bellacor can help you get ready!... tips on how to select an area rug with all the styles and colors available choosing an area rug that integrates with your... you don’t have to be a professional interior designer.. have you ever gotten into the mind of a designer and learned about their creative... sink styles: how to choose the right style if sinks prove anything, it’s that even the most utilitarian fixtures in your home can... leave a reply cancel comment reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *comment name * email * recent posts holiday printables 5 lighting trends for 2017 diy your light switches, dimmers and outlets recent style galleries recent interviews lulie wallace june 22, 2016 brandon levin may 25, 2016 geoffrey warner may 23, 2016 follow us 5 easy and budget-friendly halloween diy craft ideasfall diy projects: winterizing your home bright ideas blog wit & delight top 12 picks minneapolis trendsetter, kate arends, shares her top picks for home. read more ▸ join opt-out at any time. see our commitment to privacy for details. company about us careers bellacorpro for affiliates for vendors articles need help? 1-877-723-5522 today 7 am - 5 pm ctcustomer care returns shipping international orders join our mailing list join opt-out at any time. see our commitment to privacy for details. follow us © copyright 2008-2016 bellacor and bellacorpro are registered trademarks of bellacor.com, inc. all rights reserved. 251 1st avenue n, suite 600 minneapolis, mn 55401 terms & conditions | privacy policy | site map bellacor shop bellacor lighting fixtures furniture lamps fans rugs bath kitchen bedding outdoor kids sale & clearance shop by bright ideas stories on trend helpful tips home in progress recipes giveaways design ideas resources lamp buying guide outdoor lighting buying guide ceiling fan buying guide chandelier buying guide light bulb buying guide modern style guide victorian style guide pro spotlights
