accent table will do the trick. above is a quick visual glimpse for buying the best rug for you based on general shapes and sizes. for a much deeper dive, our rug buying guide will take you on a journey through the truly nuanced world of rug sizes, types, construction, materials, maintenance and more. the best rugs for different needs and uses thinking rug maintenance thinking rug construction rug maintenance and construction when choosing a unique rug, your lifestyle in the space will really drive your purchasing decision. think about traffic patterns, seating arrangements, and rug construction for starters. for high traffic areas, darker colors and coarse materials won't show dirt as easily and will hold up better against the rigors of heavy foot traffic. darker wool area rugs are just one option for such spaces. also consider whether the rug you've selected is machine washable or if it even needs to be for your specific placement. if you will be unable to wash your rug, other maintenance elements to consider for longevity include water-, fade-, and stain-resistant materials. these are often made with colorfast dyes – a term for characterizing a material's resistance to color fading and running. this level of product detail will be included in the product specs where applicable. when thinking about rug construction, also consider the differences pictured above in clockwise order: hand knotted rugs, flat woven options, hand hooked designs, braided patterns, machine woven rugs, and hand tufted features. hand knotted rugs feature exquisite detailing where each knot is hand tied to the foundation for an increasingly strong and intricate pattern. flat woven designs are designed on looms in a basket weaving pattern. moreover, hand hooked options are looped on a grid or canvas whereas braided designs are constructed as their namesake suggests - in repetitive braids of cloth, cotton, wool or burlap. for more rug ideas and specifics, we invite you to read more in the buying guide linked above. - faqs - q: what makes a quality rug? + - a: hand-knotting is an ancient rug making technique, but it's still used today. the more knots per square inch, the better. hand-tufted rugs are the next best thing because that means they're half man-made. the best way to see if these techniques were employed is to check the underside of the rug. if you see the pattern in reverse, it's hand-knotted; if you see a backing, it's hand-tufted. the best rugs are made by hand by skilled artisans. online you don't always have access to the underside of the rugs photos. but on bellacor.com product pages we can help you with product specifications that answer that question and more. q: how often should one vacuum a rug? + - a: this follows the same general formula for vacuuming carpets. vacuum daily, time allowing, in high-traffic areas or ones frequented by pets. think twice weekly in medium-traffic, and weekly in light-traffic, using attachments on the edges. q: what size rug does one need under a queen or king bed? + - a: measure 30 inches on each side of the bed to create a border. the rug should be at least 4 inches from the wall. plus, make sure it doesn't cover any vents, of course. for a king or queen, 8x10 and 9x12 rugs are probably sufficient to cover that space. q: how long will an area rug last? + - a: like many things, your rug's durability is likely determined by the quality of the material and construction, plus the amount of traffic in a space. finally, your daily upkeep is a determining factor. high quality, well-cared-for rugs can last 20-50 years. on the other end of the spectrum, you're probably looking at 5 years. sign up for 15%* off your 1st order email address + *opt-out at any time. see
