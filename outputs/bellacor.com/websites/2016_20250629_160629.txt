fix it with symmetryhome stories helpful tips ugly house? fix it… wendy weinert helpful tips 0 comments you might not spend much time thinking about symmetry, but it affects you, me and everyone else. for instance, people with symmetrical faces are often seen as more attractive (although we rarely realize symmetry is the reason). in interior design, symmetry can help you feel safe and comfortable. it can also help make a room feel complete. try these three ideas for creating symmetrical balance in your home. a little symmetry might be just what your interior needs to turn into a beautiful and welcoming environment. invest in two nightstands instead of one. placing a nightstand on both sides of your bed will give your room stability and help you feel more comfortable right before falling asleep. create symmetry with artwork. there are different ways to do this. you could hang up two pieces side by side or group four pictures of the same size and shape together. if you want to hang up three paintings, have the outer pieces match in size and shape. hang two pendants above the dining table. if you have a larger table, this is a great way to ensure proper lighting. i’ve only listed a few, but the possibilities for creating symmetry are endless. besides using the ideas above, you can also create a symmetrical balance by pinpointing the vertical axis in each room and then decorating both sides of that axis so that they mirror each other. for example, in the living room, the coffee table can be considered the axis, in which case seating on both sides should then match. without even realizing it, we see symmetrical designs as being more attractive and balanced than those without it. while not everything in your home needs to be perfectly symmetrical (that would get boring fast), mirroring furniture and/or decor can bring order to your space and enhance its beauty. improve your home’s design with symmetry and enjoy a more comforting, attractive space. bedroomliving room please share this tweet like plus one pin it share wendy weinert wendy weinert is an hgtv addict and avid diyer. when not working on a craft project, as an interior design blogger and enthusiast, she is passionately helping people beautify their environment by providing insightful advice and inspiration. related posts buying a ceiling fan part one: matching the fan to your space buying a ceiling fan isn’t just a matter of picking out the design you like... common outdoor lighting mistakes and their solutions upgrading your home’s exterior lighting is a surefire way to increase your home’s curb appeal... how to choose the right paint color if you’ve ever spent any time at your local paint store or even in a... 5 things you might not know about led lighting you’ve surely heard the hubbub about getting rid of old-style incandescent light bulbs and switching... leave a reply cancel comment reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *comment name * email * recent posts holiday printables 5 lighting trends for 2017 diy your light switches, dimmers and outlets recent style galleries recent interviews lulie wallace june 22, 2016 brandon levin may 25, 2016 geoffrey warner may 23, 2016 follow us turn your kitchen into a cafe with these 5 ideas5 easy and budget-friendly halloween diy craft ideas bright ideas blog wit & delight top 12 picks minneapolis trendsetter, kate arends, shares her top picks for home. read more ▸ join opt-out at any time. see our commitment to privacy for details. company about us careers bellacorpro for affiliates for vendors articles need help?
