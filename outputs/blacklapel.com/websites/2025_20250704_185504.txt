from google reviews darren m. ★★★★★ this is what shopping should be like. seamless, excellent service, amazing product and sincere follow-up from beginning to end. every order has been spot on and if i did need tweaks due to my love of cake, they just make it easy. the concierge team is like family at this point and they offer awesome suggestions. any questions...look how dope i look in my newest suit. right out the box, light steam and i'm off to my event. sexy never looked his good. from yelp eljin a. ★★★★★ i first discovered black lapel a few years back. i remember the very first time i ordered their store was located by fit (fashion institute of technology). they have now since moved and expanded! since i was impressed with the quality of he clothes and services, i ordered more from them! customer service is awesome here. i suggest you make an appointment and check out their stuff in the manhattan showroom. if you are out of town i suggest get an airbnb and drop by nyc get measured and pick out your clothes. you only have to visit once, and they can save your measurements then you can just order online next time! from yelp from yelp sam r. ★★★★★ black lapel is the best custom suit maker. when it comes to quality and fit, nobody does it better. i recently got the mohair blend tuxedo and broadcloth shirt for my wedding and both came out perfectly. incredible customer service as well. can't wait to get a suit from black lapel. from google reviews tony l. ★★★★★ unlike some of my more stylish friends, i know very little about fashion... but with my wedding coming up soon, i wanted to wear something that looked sleek and classy. doing my due diligence, i chose black lapel based on the quality of their clothing and glowing online reviews. at first i was hesitant about online clothiers, but this experience turned out great results that exceeded my expectations! the customer service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating with the requests/adjustments i made during the process. the custom fitted tuxedo looked amazing, and my wife and i could not be happier. definitely a great investment, and looking to add more custom suits to my closet soon! from yelp ryan s. ★★★★★ i ordered a suit and shirt from black lapel and i was extremely pleased with the whole process. the fit of the suit was incredible and well exceeded my expectations. the only alteration is the hem in the front created too much break in the leg. the customer service was amazing; the response times, the wealth of knowledge, and the attitude were fantastic. i felt reassured throughout the process and i trusted them as a company. the suit fits better than the off the rack suits i own that cost two to three times as much. i've never had a dress shirt fit so well. i look forward to a long relationship to this suit and shirt. i would strongly recommend black lapel for any clothing needs. from google reviews locations & contacts new york showroom newyork@blacklapel.com 917-900-2655 online & concierge concierge@blacklapel.com 781-236-3559 denver showroom denver@blacklapel.com 720-800-5705 boston showroom boston@blacklapel.com 617-763-2007 products suits shirts blazers black tie pants outerwear support faq & alterations alteration request privacy policy terms of use cookie policy accessibility company our story journal showrooms quality reviews virtual styling schedule a fitting make an appointment join our newsletter > thank you for signing up!
