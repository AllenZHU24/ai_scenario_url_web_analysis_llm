better. when you try on your black lapel custom suit for the first time, you’ll start to notice some differences in how you carry yourself. you might find yourself standing a little taller or talk more assertively at your next meeting. or maybe you wake up on your wedding day and look forward to suiting up, because in your custom wedding tux, you just feel so damn good. creating those moments around the world is the reason we’re in the business. we don’t live for the sale, we live for the way our clients stride looks a little different as they leave our showroom, or the way they smile just a little more, knowing they are looking their very best. made in thailand we don’t believe in obfuscating facts about our production facility–we’re proudly owned and operated by a u.s.-based apparel manufacturing company who has a state-of-the-art tailoring facility in thailand employing nearly 400 people. thailand has long been a renowned destination for custom suiting and custom shirts, and we’ve harnessed the best talent the country has to offer, and brought in some of the top talent in the world to further develop our team. our master tailor has over 30 years of experience traveling the world and has been tutored by savile row bespoke clothing makers. while many people have varied perceptions about manufacturing abroad, our working conditions are also among the best world-wide. we offer above-average wages, a safe, clean facility, and we employ many extended families and ensure they have flexible hours for family- and child-care. our owners spend over half the year on the ground in the workshop ensuring we maintain these high standards. individualized service every garment we make is for a unique individual–we believe our service and experience should be too. modern techology we believe in using old-world techniques enhanced by modern technology to deliver consistency. quality done right we don’t believe in taking shortcuts or making sacrifices when it comes to how we operate. individualized service much in the same way every garment we make is unique, the stories that lead our clients here are as well. we don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all anything: that means we service each person with an approach tailored to their unique needs, and we put satisfaction before policy. we’re always willing to go above and beyond in order to ensure our clients are 100% happy with the outcome of their garments, and we empower our team to develop creative solutions to any situation that may arise, ensuring you receive an experience that suits you. most importantly, our entire team is full-time and salaried, ensuring that every case is handled with the utmost care and attention. we’ll never pass you off to someone who isn’t fully invested in you as an individual, and you can and should hear from the same person anytime you contact us. modern techology the industry of custom and bespoke suits for men has long been defined by tradition and old-world craftsmanship. we have an incredible respect for the artisans who craft suiting and have maintained these traditions, but we also believe that modern technology can provide an edge to ensure consistent, high quality results. because we cut hundreds of unique patterns every day for our custom suits, custom shirts, and custom outerwear, we’ve used that data to create algorithms that help nail the fit for every body type, and reduce the need for alterations. we use pattern softwares from gerber and tuka to draft precise patterns, and invest in the newest, german technology for cutting and other machine work to ensure each garment is delivered as expected. additionally, every single workstation in our workshop is outfitted with a personal computer to display the exact specifications needed at their step in the process–where they then use their skills to produce the traditional hand-constructed elements you’d expect from high-end men’s bespoke tailors. quality done right quality doesn’t start when we cut the fabric from the bolt to make your custom suit or custom shirt, it starts years before. it’s a mentality that affects the way we source materials, develop patterns, construct our garments, and even the way we built our facility and the thousands of processes inside. when we started to make men’s custom suits, we made the decision that we would never sacrifice on the qualities that separate us from our competitors to save a buck: we never use glue, fusing, or low-quality interlinings. we maintain hand-crafted details like pick stitching, milanese boutonnieres, and button shanks that others turn to a machine for. and we source our fabrics directly from some of the most renowned mills in the world, including reda, vitale barberis, loro piana, and thomas mason. let's get you looking good we offer free shipping on all orders, easy returns, and a flawless fit guarantee. shop now locations & contacts new york showroom newyork@blacklapel.com 917-900-2655
