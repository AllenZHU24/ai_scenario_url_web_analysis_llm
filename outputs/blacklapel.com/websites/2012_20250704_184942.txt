in this familiar form: “i don’t <em>really</em> want to spend this much<em>,</em> but i’d love to have (designer) brand x.” so why do we do it? we splurge (or “invest,” as we euphemistically like to

nothing wrong with that. but the better question to ask is how can you get a product that satisfies the aforementioned criteria without breaking the bank, and in return, get an even better investment?</p> <p>in this article, we’re going to break down black lapel suits vs. some notable designer brands. the purpose is not to push our products on you (though we obviously won’t be upset if it convinces you to give us a try!) but to show you that the menswear space, particularly online, has some great options that are worth exploring. from high quality tees to chinos, specialty accessories and other types of casual wear, there are brands that will satisfy your quality criteria without diminishing that crucial swag factor. but since we make, know and love high-quality suits, we figured it’d be best to start here.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-26439875685" title="bond_otr_v3"

what brand he wears.</em></p> <p><strong>so what do you get when you go with a black lapel suit vs. an off-the-rack (otr) designer brand?</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>equal or better quality: </strong>from fabric quality to construction method, a black lapel custom suit can compete with, if not surpass that of an otr designer suit. a black lapel suit, for example, is made with 100% australian merino wool and crafted by master tailors with over 20 years of experience. and yes, we make all of our clothing in china (specifically, in shanghai) and we&#8217;re not afraid to admit that because what may (or may not) come as a surprise to you, is that most luxury brands do as well. are tons of cheap, inexpensive clothing made in china? sure. but that doesn’t take away from the fact that many quality, luxury goods are now also <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b88b4a38-0d57-11e2-97a1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28poud1x0">made in china</a>.  <strong></strong></li> <li><strong>personally designed: </strong>going custom means having control over a dozen different options so you’re not limited to any particular detail. with an otr brand, you take what you get. <strong></strong></li> <li><strong>individualized fit: </strong>the most obvious benefit of going custom means owning a suit that’s <em>made for you and only you</em>. with an otr suit, you are conforming to a pre-determined size that’s meant to fit as many people as possible. since no two bodies are built the same way, this will naturally result in an inferior fit for many.</li> <li><strong>brand yourself: </strong>your “swag factor” (as we often call it) isn’t determined by the amount of money you spend on clothing, it’s determined by intelligently spending money on clothing that makes you look and feel your best. there’s nothing wrong with dropping loot on designer-brand clothing, unless you think that doing so will somehow transform you into james bond. james bond would be james bond with or without a tom ford suit&#8230;and so long as he&#8217;s got that bond swagger and looks good in what he wears, we&#8217;d still dig him. so remember that a brand does not and should not define you. you should define yourself in whatever you choose to wear &#8211; i.e., <em>you</em> should brand yourself. and in our humble opinion, there’s no better way to brand yourself than to wear high quality clothes that are made by you, for you.    <strong>  </strong></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>that all being said, how does a company like black lapel stack up against some of the best designer brands at 2x-4x the price? let&#8217;s take a look:</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bl_vs_otr_full_v82.jpg"><img

height="1079" /></a></p> <p><strong>how does a company like black lapel do what it does?</strong></p> <p>this must be too good to be true right? how else would a company like black lapel create designer-quality custom suits at inherently discounted prices? for one, we’ve done extensive traveling, research and testing to find the best. and secondly, we have streamlined our business to eliminate many costs that would traditionally get passed on to you. specifically, we have:</p> <ul> <li><strong>no physical storefronts: </strong>the entire custom shopping experience is completely online. the benefit is that we can pass on the savings of a lean operation directly to you &#8211; i.e.,  not having to maintain the costs of having physical stores (inventory, rent, equipment, sales people, etc.).</li> <li><strong>no 3<sup>rd</sup> party distributors: </strong>we don’t wholesale to stores, who would mark up items before selling them to you; we make each suit individually for you and ship it directly to you.</li> <li><strong>no designer label markups: </strong>ever wonder why a designer brand will sell a regular t-shirt for a couple benjamins? because they can &#8211; some people will buy it. can we do the same? sure. many customers often tell us that we’re crazy because they’d willingly pay double the price of what we charge. then why don’t we? by making luxury-quality clothing more accessible, the world is a better place because more men can dress better and feel better about themselves. real talk.</li> </ul> <p>many of you might of had your doubts about what you would get when you pay less for something that’s supposed to be of equivalent quality. after all, the market has conditioned us to think that higher price = better quality. it might be true in some cases, but often times, the premium you pay comes from the brand name itself – and how important that is to you is really a matter of personal choice.</p> <p>so before your next clothing purchase, go online first and do some exploring. find brands that stand behind quality products and care about how these products can help you look and feel better; understand their <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/customer-service/flawless-fit-promise/">customer service policies</a> and email them to see how they can help you <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/customer-service/concierge/">achieve sartorial goals</a>.  there are some companies just like ours who are built to give you a lot more bang for your buck and are passionate about making sure that you&#8217;re entirely satisfied with what you get. we encourage you to come and see for yourself. so the next time you want some fresh custom clothes, we&#8217;ll be

<p><strong>1. review </strong>(your current wardrobe)</p> <p>a smart shopper knows what’s in his closet. so before you start buying, do a quick inventory of your current wardrobe. keep the list you formed in <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/the-savvy-gentlemans-guide-to-shopping-part-2-top-down-shopping/" target="_blank">part 2 of our guide</a> handy, so you know which items you already have. once you start digging through your wardrobe, you’ll find duplicates, pieces you never wear and pieces that are either too small or too big (more likely the latter). use this as an opportunity to purge and/or replace – not hoard clothing that you never wear. start by making two piles of:</p> <ol> <li><strong>clothing that can be improved through tailoring – </strong>have a pair of chinos that are size 34 when you should be wearing size 32? not all hope is lost. take it to a local tailor and have them alter it.<strong></strong></li> <li><strong>clothing that can be donated – </strong>if you never wear it and a professional tailor can’t make it wearable, donate it. it will do more good for someone else than it will for you. clothing donations are also tax-deductible so it’s your chance to keep a little more coin in your pocket when uncle sam comes to collect. <em>here are a couple places you can donate to: </em><a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/" target="_blank"><em>salvation army</em></a><em> &amp; </em><a href="http://www.careergear.org/"><em>career gear</em></a><em>.</em><strong> </strong></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2. prioritize </strong>(your shopping list)</p> <p>now it’s time to prioritize. prioritization allows you to make smart purchases based on your needs vs. wants, so that you don’t end up with a closet full of designer t-shirts when you’re wearing a suit and tie 5 days a week.</p> <p>not sure where to start? create your own need / want scale. try a 5 point scale with 1 being lowest need / want and 5 being the highest need / want. given that you should place your needs before your wants, make every need point 1.5x every want point. add up your ratings for each item will help prioritize what you will buy. here is an example:</p> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/needwhatchart_v6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26439875652" title="needwhatchart_v6" src="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/needwhatchart_v6.jpg" alt="" width="803" height="477" /></a></p> <p><strong>3. budget </strong>(your items)</p> <p>you’ll see that we added a “max budget per item” column in the preceding chart. that’s because regardless of your clothing budget, you should always think of buying clothes as an investment. as with all investments, you want the greatest return. for clothing, you should think about your return in the context of 1) how much use you’ll get out of it and 2) how good it looks on you. so before you splurge on that pricey leather jacket, think about how much return it will actually provide. know that transforming your wardrobe won’t happen overnight…but this is for the better because being patient will force you to think twice about what you need. and remember, it’s better to <a href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/the-case-for-spending-a-little-more-sometimes/" target="_blank">pay a little extra for better quality</a> clothes that <em>fit to flatter</em>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/library.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26439875614" title="library" src="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/library.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" /></a></p> <p><strong>4. research and purchase</strong></p> <p>always do your research! a savvy shopper will usually do research to determine the best quality / style of a desired item within their budget. here are some ways the best shoppers go about doing their research:</p> <p>1)     use the internet:</p> <ol> <li>seek out the experts of the menswear blogosphere. not only will you get <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/ask-a-black-lapel-stylist-straight-bar-lacing/" target="_blank">answers</a>, but blogs allow you to take it a step further and directly interact with style gurus through comments.</li> <li>tap into community style forums like <a href="http://www.styleforum.net" target="_blank">styleforum.net</a> or reddit’s excellent <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice" target="_blank">mfa</a> (men’s fashion advice). you’ll find everything from user reviews, best ofs and even “ama” (ask me anything) threads on retailers and designers.</li> </ol> <p>2)     get the scoop through stylish friends, family and co-workers:</p> <ol> <li>discover brands (like <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com" target="_blank">black lapel</a>): a custom made black lapel suit is a prime example of the benefits of doing your research. almost all of our customers hear about us organically through their personal networks or internet forums. why? stylish gents know that when they buy a black lapel custom suit, they’re getting designer quality fabric and construction with a better fit (since it’s custom made) at a better price.  check it out:</li> </ol> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bl_vs_canali1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26439875642" title="bl_vs_canali" src="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bl_vs_canali1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="518" /></a></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. find designer collaborations: <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2012/09/-complete-best-new-menswear-designers-collaboration-gap.html" target="_blank">gq recently teamed up with gap</a> (yes, gap!) and some of the hottest new menswear designers to make fashion-forward clothing at affordable price points (think gap’s prices).</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. find sample sales: really craving pricey brands but can’t stomach actually forking up the dough? do a quick google search to see what type of sample sales are going on in your area. sites like <a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/shopping" target="_blank">time out new york</a> (not just nyc) and <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/mktg/92236/nation" target="_blank">thrillist</a> often list what’s coming up in your own city.<strong> </strong></p> <p>shopping efficiently and effectively takes some planning, but it doesn’t have to be frustrating. no more aimless, time-sucking and money-wasting hours spent shopping. it’s great to be a vagabond when exploring a new country, not in a crowded mall. so as you lay the foundations for new wardrobe and a more stylish you, know that you&#8217;re on an extremely rewarding path towards looking great and feeling great!</p> <p>we hope our 3-part shopping series was helpful. now, go forth and upgrade your look!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/?p=26439875439 at some point in our lives, all of us have experienced frustration and impatience when it comes to shopping for clothes. and unfortunately, many of us allow these frustrating experiences to get in the way of becoming a more stylish person – we give up and we think that working towards becoming more stylish is superficial, unimportant and a waste of time. but remember this, being a stylish person is much more than just looking good on a superficial level. it means that as an individual, you take pride in thinking about how to physically express yourself in the best manner possible. hung up on a rack, clothes have no meaning to anyone. you give your clothes meaning when you take the time to decide what you’re going to buy and how you’re going to make them look spectacular on your body. so in part 2 of our guide to shopping, we’ll show you how you can translate your portfolio of visual inspiration into an efficient and

us have experienced frustration and impatience when it comes to shopping for clothes. and unfortunately, many of us allow these frustrating experiences to get in the way of becoming a more stylish person – we give up and we think that working towards becoming more stylish is superficial, unimportant and a waste of time. but remember this, being a stylish person is much more than just looking good on a superficial level. it means that as an individual, you take pride in thinking about how to physically express yourself in the best manner possible. hung up on a rack, clothes have no meaning to anyone. you give your clothes meaning when you take the time to decide what you’re going to buy and how you’re going to make them look spectacular on your body.</p> <p>so in part 2 of our guide to shopping, we’ll show you how you can translate your <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/the-savvy-mans-guide-on-how-to-shop-for-clothing-part1-using-visual-inspiration/">portfolio of visual inspiration</a> into an efficient and actionable shopping approach we call the “top-down” shopping method.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>how most of us shop: bottom-up (thinking in pieces)</strong></p> <p>many of us start off as “bottom-up” shoppers – meaning, we shop for individual pieces without thinking about how we would wear that individual piece as stylish component in a multitude of outfits. bottom-up shoppers think like this: “oh, i need some new button down shirts and pants. so let me just hit up the mall real quick, see what catches my eye and drop that sh*t on my amex.” at face value, it may sound harmless but this is often what happens:</p> <ol> <li>you waste money on something that you don’t really like all that much.</li> <li>you waste money on something that doesn’t quite “work” with what’s already in your closet, so you don&#8217;t wear it often, if at all.</li> <li>you waste time not really finding anything.</li> </ol> <p>and in the end, you don’t build a congruent wardrobe that will help improve your personal style. so to the gentlemen who have a stockpile of “wtf-is-this!” clothing collecting dust in your closets, wondering why the gods of style haven’t helped them…listen up!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>how we should shop: top-down (thinking in outfits)</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/kanye.jpg"><img

<a href="http://blacklapelcc.tumblr.com/">portfolio of visual inspiration</a> you started creating last week is to think (and feel) in terms of an aesthetic that resonates most with <em>how you want to look</em>. it’s important to recognize that saturating your mind with stylish looks will eventually influence your tastes and ultimately color your instinctual shopping decisions, but the best way to turn visual inspiration into your own style is to define the specific pieces that comprise the looks you are drawn to.</p> <p>top-down shopping means that even if you do actually purchase in pieces<em>,</em> you should start <em>thinking about these pieces in the context of outfits.</em> this is important because by always having a variety of outfits in mind, you can now figure out the pieces you need to achieve the “look” you’re going for. and of course, it helps to make a list. but if you feel like putting your management-consultant skills to work, a flow chart like this also helps:</p> <p><strong>elements of [insert your name here]’s sartorial inspirations:</strong></p> <p>(click on image to enlarge)</p> <p><a

href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzkp7q19f0" target="_blank">gangnam style </a></em></div> <p>see how every item on this flow chart / shopping list works together seamlessly to create an array of outfits that are appropriate for a variety of occasions? the top-down approach forces you to re-orient your purchasing decisions in a way that facilitates the creation of a dynamic wardrobe. and since a shopping list like the above is derived from the very looks that inspired you, it’ll help you achieve that new and improved style in a balanced and intelligent manner.</p> <p>so get started on your own list…but don’t just go out and start buying just yet! it’s important that you take your time here. keep using visual inspiration to further refine and think about which items you really want (or need) so you can make smart purchasing decisions. it can hurt to be indecisive, but it never hurts to be sure.</p> <p>once you’ve decided on a list of items that you know you’ll love, it’s time to drop some loot. so stay tuned for part 3, where we’ll give you tips on acquiring your new items in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.</p> <p><em>got some tips on the “top-down” shopping

you’re creating a collage of your personal tastes and preferences. and remember, don&#8217;t be intimidated by these images; don&#8217;t let the thought of &#8220;i&#8217;ll never look this good&#8221; cross your mind because it&#8217;s simply not true. you can look this good and by identifying the elements that make your particular visual portfolio so appealing to you, you can figure out what sort of looks and outfits will be best used to express your own style. so pay close attention to the images where you find yourself reacting in “damn, that’s sharp!” kind of way and start writing down the patterns you recognize. click on the image below for an example:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/define_v3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-26439875378 aligncenter" title="define_v3" src="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/define_v3.jpg" alt="" width="834" height="512" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><em>(click on image for a larger view)</em></p> <p>as you’ll see, if your hypothetical patterns were similar to the above, you could safely conclude that your preferred aesthetic could be identified as dressed up, clean cut, sharply tailored, worn in simple and classic styles and colors, with some extra pizzazz in the form of tasteful accessories. now that you have a framework to work off of, you’re also less likely to fall victim to recklessly buying something that doesn’t quite fit your taste profile, whether it be browsing online or in a store.</p> <p>so if you’re building your wardrobe, visual inspiration is a great way for you to identify your own tastes. if you’re refining or adding to your wardrobe, it&#8217;s a great way for you to identify how your tastes have begun to evolve. regardless of what stage you’re at, make sure you&#8217;re using visual inspiration as the first step of the shopping process!</p> <p><strong>in part 2 next week,</strong> we’ll show you can use the “top-down” approach to shopping by breaking down visual inspiration into individual pieces to recreate an entire wardrobe of photo spread-worthy outfits.</p> <p>stay tuned!</p> <p><em>we love to know what inspires you, so please share your own visual inspirations with our community at </em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/blacklapel"><em>www.facebook.com/blacklapel</em></a><em> or leave your own tumblr and pinterest accounts in the comments so we can follow you!</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/the-savvy-mans-guide-on-how-to-shop-for-clothing-part1-using-visual-inspiration/feed/ 4 ask a black lapel stylist: proper suit jacket length http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/ask-a-black-lapel-stylist-proper-suit-jacket-length/ http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/ask-a-black-lapel-stylist-proper-suit-jacket-length/#comments mon, 17 sep 2012 05:00:56 +0000 black lapel ask a black lapel stylist http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/?p=26439875339 q: dear black lapel, how long should my suit jacket be?

what are you communicating when you opt for a peak lapel verses a slim notch? what do the differences mean to you, if anything?</p> <p>to many, it may not mean a thing. but to those who are discerning of the details &#8211; an interviewer, a potential business partner or even that attractive blonde across the room &#8211;  it may mean a lot. just like how you wouldn&#8217;t wear a floral print shirt to a funeral, you wouldn&#8217;t want to head into a boardroom looking like <a href="http://vlsportysexycool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/d-wade-flip-ups.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><em>you never get a second chance to make a first impression. &#8211; will rogers</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>your suit as the language of success</strong></p> <p>dressing for success is a bit like writing, if you’re writing to communicate a message to your readers, you have to be mindful of the language, syntax, grammar and the choice of your words.  think of every element of your outfit as a word in a sentence—from the fabric of your suit to the style of your pockets. make sure you know the meaning of each word, and choose your words carefully.</p> <p><strong>ask yourself this: what does your suit say about you?</strong> <strong>what do the details say?</strong></p> <p>the wardrobe stylists behind the characters harvey specter and mike ross in the show &#8220;suits&#8221; obviously understand this &#8220;language.&#8221; while both characters look incredible in their well-fitting suits, the details of their looks conveys two very different messages.</p> <p><a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/640px-s01e05p133_harvey_mike.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26439875086" title="640px-s01e05p133_harvey_mike" src="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/640px-s01e05p133_harvey_mike.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a></p> <p>in the show, mike ross frequently wears a slimmer, more understated and conservatively (but still smartly) tailored suit (slim notch lapel, no vest, slim tie with a small four-in-hand knot), representing the young associate, a bit wet behind the ears, but quickly rising under the promising tutelage of the firm&#8217;s top star, harvey specter. harvey, on the other hand, truly dresses like a boss. he&#8217;s the top closer of his firm, and his power suits convey his status at his firm perfectly. everything in harvey&#8217;s look evokes strength from the 3-piece suit to the spread collar and windsor knot. this stark contrast shows how effectively an outfit can communicate a message of power.</p> <p>now we don&#8217;t blame you if you want to look like harvey specter. like we said, the guy straight up looks boss. he&#8217;s there to make moves and it&#8217;s evident by his clothes alone that things have been working out rather nicely for him. replicating a look like this requires a sensitivity to your context and the message you&#8217;re trying to get across.</p> <p><strong>here&#8217;s the break-down of the harvey specter power suit look: </strong></p> <p>- a custom tailored 3-piece pinstripe suit (with vest) such as this <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/suits/gray-chalk-stripe.html" target="_blank">one</a> or this <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/suits/navy-light-blue-pinstripe.html" target="_blank">one</a> with the following features:<br /> - flapped pockets with a ticket pocket<br /> - double-vents<br /> - boutonniere<br /> - wider peak lapels</p> <p><strong>then add these power accessories:</strong></p> <p>- <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/accessories/solid-white-pocket-square.html" target="_blank">pocket square</a><br /> - <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/accessories/metal-knot-cuff-link.html" target="_blank">cufflinks</a><br /> - pick up a <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/shirts/solid-white-shirt.html" target="_blank">custom tailored shirt</a> and opt for spread collars and french cuffs<br /> - pick up a 3-3.5 inch width <a href="http://www.blacklapel.com/accessories/black-lavender-striped-tie.html" target="_blank">bold tie</a> with a larger knot such as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqqr09ja1zy" target="_blank">windsor knot</a></p> <p><strong>want to go for mike&#8217;s younger rising star look?</strong> check out our post on <a title="what to wear to an interview" href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/office-style-101-what-to-wear-to-an-interview/" target="_blank">interview suits</a> and <a title="wardrobe essentials" href="http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/office-style-101-13-essentials-of-the-professional/" target="_blank">wardrobe essentials</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>was this article helpful?</strong> have any questions about harvey&#8217;s &#8220;power suit&#8221; look or mike&#8217;s &#8220;rising star&#8221; look?
