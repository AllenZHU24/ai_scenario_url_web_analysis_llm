jacket/shirt length start measurement from the point where your neck meets your shoulder. measure straight down over your chest and stomach to the point on your thigh parallel to your knuckles. to check the measurement, measure from the same starting point straight down the length of your back and compare the finished measurement. make sure that the measurement covers most or all of your butt. note: stand naturally without over-expanding your chest when taking this measurement. remember that the back of the jacket is usually one inch shorter than the front, so keep that in mind when taking the length. our instructions will result in a slightly shorter jacket than some off the rack brands. if you prefer a more traditional jacket length, consider adding up to one inch to this measurement

at your sides once the tape is around your chest when taking this measurement. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43
