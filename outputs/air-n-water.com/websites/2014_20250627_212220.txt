shipping industry leader federal express to ensure efficient and secure delivery of your order. when you place your order, please be sure to include the correct billing address. if you are shipping to a different address, please have this address added to your credit card to prevent any shipping delays. for a question about a specific order, please call us at 1-800-734-0405. delivery times when placing your order, please keep in mind that there are two components to calculate total shipping time for your order to reach you - order processing and time in transit. please see below for more information. order processing most orders placed before 1:00 p.m. pst for items that are in stock in the air & water warehouse will be shipped on the same business day. orders placed after 1:00 p.m. pst will be shipped the following business day. in some cases, when we do not have the unit in stock in our warehouse, but the manufacturer has supplies, we are able to ship the unit directly from the manufacturer. processing for these orders can take a few hours up to several weeks, depending on the efficiency of the manufacturer's warehouse.to help you with your purchasing decision, we list the average time it will take for an order to process for each product listed on our website. orders for some products will process more quickly than others, due to order volume, inventory status, and the efficiency of the warehouse shipping the product. we try to be as fair and accurate as possible, when listing each product's availability, so please be sure to check unit availability before placing your order. despite our best efforts, occasionally, a product might go out of stock before we are able to update the availability status on our website. in these cases, you will be contacted with your options by one of our expert customer service representatives. time in transit all items, unless otherwise noted, ship via fedex or ups ground service, which is the most economical shipping option for our customers. some of our smaller products ship via usps. most larger appliances ship via a freight carrier. from the date of shipment, ground service rarely takes more than 5-7 business days to reach its destination. however, please note that ground shipping times are estimates only. while most products will be delivered in this timeframe, if you need your order delivered by a certain date, we recommend that you call our customer service team  at 1-800-734-0405 to guarantee a ship date. please see the map below for estimated fedex ground delivery times to your location from our southern california warehouse: standard shipping 3 day shipping any products with the following symbol will deliver within 3 business days or less to 99% of the contiguous us. after we process your order, we will begin shipping your order to you. once the order has been shipped you will receive a follow up email from us letting you know that your order has been shipped. this email will include tracking information that will allow you to view your item's progress as it makes its way to your doorstep. expedited delivery expedited delivery is available on select products that ship via fedex or ups. if you would like expedited delivery, please select that option at checkout, if it is offered. if you are not offered the option for expedited shipping, that option is not available on that product. please note that we must process your expedited order through our system. if the item availability is marked as "ships today" and the order is placed before 1 p.m. pst, we will be able to ship your order same day with expedited delivery. however, if the item is not marked with a status that says "ships today," an expedited order may still take several days to process before it ships from the manufacturer's warehouse. if you have any questions, please call us toll free at1-800-734-0405 . shipping to areas outside the contiguous u.s. our online shipping quotes are for deliveries within the contiguous u.s. only. for deliveries to alaska, hawaii, canada, puerto rico, other us territories, and some apo addresses, shipping charges will be recalculated and adjusted. in these cases, you will receive a call or e-mail from one of our representatives with an update prior to order fulfillment. order verification while we process your order, you may be contacted by a customer service representative to verify your order and billing information after purchase. if you cannot be reached, your order may be delayed. the best way to ensure there is no delay on your delivery, double check all information you enter during checkout. inspecting your order when it arrives if your order shipped via freight carrier, please thoroughly inspect your item before signing for the package. we recommend that you verify the following items before signing the bill of landing: make sure that you have received the correct item. check to make sure that there is not damage to the packaging. if there is damage more than normal wear and tear that occurs in transit, this could indicate that your item was damaged during shipping. if your order is correct and is in good condition, please sign for the package. however, if you did not receive the correct unit or find damage to the packaging, please refuse the package and call our customer service team at 1-800-734-0405. we will provide you with additional instructions to get your order corrected. questions for any shipping questions, please e-mail mailto:sales@air-n-water.com or call1-800-734-0405 . sidebar leftair & water
