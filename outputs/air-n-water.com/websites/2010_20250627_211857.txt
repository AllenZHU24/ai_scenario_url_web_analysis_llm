portable icemakers also operate more efficiently than freezer ice makers. once the portable units are plugged in and water is poured into the reservoir, the operating cycle begins. although each ice maker produces different amounts of ice, most of them only need about 6 to 15 minutes per cycle. the ice maker you choose depends greatly on how much ice you need: the smaller units can make up to 26 pounds of ice per day, while the larger units are able to handle up to 35 pounds of ice per day! likewise, the smaller ice makers produce less ice cubes per cycle - around 9 cubes - while the larger ice makers make about 10 or 12 ice cubes each cycle. one of the main benefits of a compact ice maker is its portability. because most portable icemakers, such as those from newair, weigh only about 30 to 50 pounds, they are perfect for camping trips, bbqs, family get-togethers, and more! these units can be taken from the indoors to the outdoors with almost no hassle at all. maintenance is also a breeze with these portable ice makers - you can simply wipe down the outside of the units with clean water and soap regularly after use. some models even have self-cleaning features, so you have one less thing to worry about!
