temperature unless you press the instant hot-water button. recommend this product.would recommend: yesname: mark b.date: 12/16/2010location: lincoln, neitem: dimplex cuh05b31t electric garage heateroverall rating: dimplex cuh05b31t electric heatermy expectations were probably unrealistic. my garage is 34x40 with 10 foot ceiling plus overhead storage another 10 foot at the peak, and insulated. have a forced-air woodburner that did not heat sufficiently, so supplemented that with this heater. it does definitely help, but i have too much space for this plus the woodburner to make it t-shirt comfortable during a nebraska winter evening. however, i used to be ok with a jacket on once it got to 60 with just the woodburner. since adding this dimplex, it feels ok in my hooded sweatshirt at about 53. the woodburner by itself, i could raise the temp inside about 25-30 degrees versus outside temp. with the dimplex plus woodburner, i can raise the inside temp 35-40 degrees. that is significant figuring i'm warming over 20,000 cubic feet of air space. overall, i am a happy customer.would recommend: yesname: j. whitedate: 12/16/2010location: jonesboro, gaitem: q-mark brh402 garage heateroverall rating: heat for the garage...my brh402 garage heater from air and water has been great. record breaking cold (at least for us) has made it essential for us to get any of our projects done. when i ordered it, it actually shipped out the same day. the heater came ready to use and has performed flawlessly (it's running now). it has been a pleasure to purchase from air and water, no surprises and prompt service. i highly recommend this company and product.would recommend: yesname: allied pixeldate: 12/16/2010location: media, paitem: clover b7a-white hot cold water

yesname: cheryldate: 12/16/2010location: springfield, moitem: soleus hm1-10-32 space heateroverall rating: quiet and warmpurchased to keep a 10x10 bedroom warm. very, very quiet and does a great job of keeping the room warm. slower to warm an area than the radiator-style heaters we also have in other rooms but once the area gets warm, it maintains the heat equally well. takes up very little space and i really like the broad heating area. would recommend: yesname: a.j.date: 12/16/2010location: pennsylvaniaitem: newair aw-181e 18 bottle wine cooleroverall rating: so far so goodonly had the cooler up and running for a few days now but everything looks to be working fine. its appearance is better than the pictures online, especially when the interior light is turned on. cooled down to 55 degrees within an hour or so, hopefully we've placed it in a spot that will hold this temp. when summer comes around. only knock we have on this cooler so far is the installation of the door handle...2 screws should be easy enough right? well the holes for the screws seem to be drilled at a slight angle and it's tough to get them to line up with the holes in the handle. even when we did manage to get them threaded, they barely grabbed the handle before we couldn't turn them anymore leaving about a 1/8" gap between the handle and door. i used a couple lock washers on the inside of the door to try and take up the slack and the handle is now flush to the door on the outside but it's still not as tight to the door as it should be. the screw holes are also under the rubber seal on the inside of the door making it difficult to tighten them, especially when the won't turn very much. if we don't get a good seal on the door now with the screws sticking out under the seal more than they should, i'll have to try and straighten out the holes with a drill which i'm hoping to avoid. other than this minor annoyance, the cooler seems to be a good product at a good price, and the shipping from air & water was extremely fast...it showed up at our house 4 days earlier than anticipated.would recommend: yesname: d. sikesdate: 12/16/2010location: springfield, gaitem: dr. heater dr-968
