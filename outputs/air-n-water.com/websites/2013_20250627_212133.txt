industry leader federal express to ensure efficient, secure delivery of your order. when you place your order, please be sure to include the correct billing address. if you are shipping to a different address, please have this address added to your credit card to prevent any shipping delays.for a question about a specific order, please call us at 1-800-734-0405.delivery timeswhen placing your order, please keep in mind that there are two components to calculate total shipping time for your order to reach you - order processing and time in transit. please see below for more information.order processingmost orders placed before 1:00 p.m. pst for items that are in stock in the air & water warehouse will be shipped on the same business day. orders placed after 1:00 p.m. pst will be shipped the following business day. in some cases, when we do not have the unit in stock in our warehouse, but the manufacturer has supplies, we are able to ship the unit directly from the manufacturer. processing for these orders can take a few hours up to several weeks, depending on the efficiency of the manufacturer's warehouse. to help you with your purchasing decision, we list the average time it will take for an order to process for each product listed on our website. orders for some products will process more quickly than others, due to order volume, inventory status, and the efficiency of the warehouse shipping the product. we try to be as fair and accurate as possible, when listing each product's availability, so please be sure to check unit availability before placing your order.despite our best efforts, occasionally, a product might go out of stock before we are able to update the availability status on our website. in these cases, you will be contacted with your options by one of our expert customer service representatives.time in transitall items, unless otherwise noted, ship via fedex or ups ground service, which is the most economical shipping option for our customers. some of our smaller products ship via usps. most larger appliances ship via a freight carrier. from the date of shipment, ground service rarely takes more than 5-7 business days to reach its destination. however, please note that ground shipping times are estimates only. while most products will be delivered in this timeframe, if you need your order delivered by a certain date, we recommend that you call our customer service team  at 1-800-734-0405 to guarantee a ship date. please see the map below for estimated fedex ground delivery times to your location from our southern california warehouse:after we process your order, we will begin shipping your order to you. once the order has been shipped you will receive a follow up email from us letting you know that your order
