corrosion occurs as a material changes from one form to another through a chemical reaction. moisture in the air often speeds up this process significantly and accelerates the reaction. dehumidifiers prevent corrosion by eliminating excess moisture in the air. addresses excess condensation - condensation is another problem that a dehumidifier can help eliminate. condensation occurs when cold surfaces are surrounded by moist air. water vapor then collects on a surface as a result, the surface proceeds to sweat. this can make the general atmosphere of the room damp.  dehumidifiers help to keep the general appearance of a room dry and clean.prevents mold and fungus growth - fungi and mold are everywhere, although they often lay dormant. they become dangerous when moisture is added to the air. mold and fungi growth can cause serious damage to your house and health. they feed on a variety of material and can even warp your walls, windows, and furniture. mildew and mold can cover your bathroom and kitchen creating unsanitary conditions and blemishes on tiles and other surfaces.improves health - excess humidity has also been known to negatively affect people's health. humidity leads to mold growth which is potentially dangerous when airborne. excess humidity can affect a person's lungs and lead a variety of lung diseases. another side effect of excess humidity is the spread of dust mites, which can also trigger allergy and asthma attacks. dust mites thrive in humid and damp areas, so it is important to keep your house as dry as possible.	extend returns until 2/23/14	no restocking fees	guaranteed holiday shippingclick for details >> shop all departmentsheatingelectric fireplaceswine & beverage coolingice makersdehumidifiershumidifierswater dispensershome appliancesbbq grills & smokersair purifiersvacuum cleanersemergency preparednessthermostatsair conditioningevaporative coolingelectric cooling fansceiling fansoutdoor furniturepool suppliesdehumidifiersshop by room size:single roomsbasementswhole housecommercialsee all dehumidifier types...editor's picksbest dehumidifierscompare dehumidifierstop selling dehumidifiersshop by price:under $200$200 -
