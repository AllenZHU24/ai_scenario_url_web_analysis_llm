humidifier humidifiers for asthma sufferers do you need a humidifier? did you know that dry air can cause cracked skin, sore throats, aggravated allergy symptoms and more?  low humidity levels can also damage your home by chipping paint and causing wood floors to split or crack.  protect your family and home from the unhealthy effects of dry air with a humidifier. what relative humidity level is ideal? the rule of thumb is 30-50%. use the digital monitor humidistat / hygrometer at the top of this page to monitor your room or home humidity level. why is dry air bad? during winter, when the heat is on, the relative humidity in your house can become very low. this is because heated air can hold much more moisture than cold air. as the air in your home heats up, it becomes "thirsty" and begins sucking moisture out of surrounding surfaces: plants, walls, furniture, books, paintings, human bodies, everything. whenever we heat air we dry out the air to uncomfortable and damaging levels. by keeping the humidity above 30%, you can normally turn down your thermostat a few notches. your heated air will feel warmer, and you will help create a safer, more efficient environment. a humidifier is ideal for this purpose. how do i determine what type of humidifier i need? choose a style first determine whether you want a cool mist or warm mist humidifier.  both are equally effective in adding moisture to the air, but there are a few differences.  keep reading for more information on two of the most popular types of humidifiers. cool mist humidifiers cool mist humidifiers are incredibly versatile and can provide year-round relief from dry weather or conditions.  this type of humidifier vaporizes the air, which makes it safer than other types of humidifiers.  cool mist humidifiers come in several different styles such as ultra sonic humidifiers and evaporative humidifiers. benefits: cost effective energy efficient warm mist humidifiers warm mist humidifiers help increase humidity and reduce dryness by releasing a warm, clean mist into the air.  for you convenience, warm mist humidifiers come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  some also include special features like germ-free technology, which use an ultravoilet light to kill germs before the mist is released into the air. benefits: less likely to contain bacteria and germs effective at relieving congestion select the appropriate size next figure out the size of your room.  humidifiers are usually rated for coverage area in square feet.  if the model is too large for your room, keep in mind that condensation can appear on windows and mirrors.  this can also facilitate bacteria and mold growth, so it's important to correctly size your humidifier.  for more information on humidifiers, see our humidifier buying guide. how can i improve the performance of my humidifier? sealing doors and windows, and fireplaces that are not in use. use tape or special window and door sealers. do not keep your humidifier in a confined space, get the most out of your humidifier by making sure it is not being restricted by it's surroundings. do not humidify over 50%, also reduce setting if moisture forms on windows, walls etc, or if there is dampness around the area of the humidifier. recommended humidity levels are between 30-50%, this will vary on your personal comfort and the type of humidifier you own. for more help, see which humidifiers we recommend or contact us at 1-800-734-0405. extend returns until 2/23/14	no restocking fees	guaranteed holiday shippingclick for
