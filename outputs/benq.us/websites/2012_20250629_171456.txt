closeclosecloseclosecloseclosecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopen please visit the benq website at www.benq-eu.com/serviceandsupport/ to download the appropriate lcd monitor drivers, alternatively you can also use the standard plug n play monitor driver in windows. 2. there is a scratch on my new lcd panel, what should i do? closecloseclosecloseclosecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopen contact your dealer. if it is a manufacturing defect, benq will replace it with a new one. however, if it was caused by the user, you may ask the dealer to ship it back to our service centre, and you or your dealer will be charged for the repair. 3. how does one justify the spot/pixel specification of an lcd panel? closeclosecloseclosecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopenopenopenopen referring to the commercial standard of an lcd panel, when a single spot is over 50%, it is regarded as one spot (red, green and blue rule 1); when two adjacent spots are rg/gb/br and are over 50%, the max. is 3 dark and 7 bright in the same screen (rule 2). please refer to api rgb lcd panel spec. 4. there are strange lines on my lcd monitor when i shut down the pc, is that normal? closecloseclosecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopenopenopen strange lines appear on an lcd panel under very few circumstances. it may be a result of the vga signal and can be corrected by the adjustment menu on the monitor. in the adjustment menu choose geometry setup and you can adjust the horizontal or vertical phase and pixel frequency. 5. my lcd monitor screen keeps blinking, what should i do? closeclosecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopenopen check the pins of the connector, if there are any bent or missing pins, contact your dealer. you can also either check the settings of your vga card or whether or not the display frequency you are using is within the limits of the monitor. 6. why can't benq fp551 adjust optimal brightness function? closecloseclosecloseclose openopenopenopenopen the fp 551 uses hosiden panel. due to the fact that the original manufacturer design of the hosiden panel driving current is limited to 5ma, when the contrast is too high, a change in the brightness is not apparent. after having conferred with hosiden, the driving current range has been modified to a larger margin and the change in brightness will become noticeable after adjustment. in order to achieve a noticeable change in brightness, we recommend the following: adjust contrast to optimal range around 25~35, then adjust brightness. there will be a distinct change in brightness. 7. i couldn't see anything on my lcd monitor after i connected the power, what should i do? closeclosecloseclose openopenopenopen check the energy saving mode; press any key or move the mouse to quit the energy saving mode. check if there are any bent or missing pins in the monitor connector. if there are, contact your dealer. 8. my lcd monitor does not have any default setting support, what should i do? closecloseclose openopenopen go into the control panels, and select "reset factory preset timings", or any default factor value from the table. 9. response time closeclose openopen the so-called response time refers to the time it takes for a liquid crystal panel to go from total white to total black and then back again (rise time (tr) + fall time (tf)). broadly speaking, the response time of lcds are slower than those of crts. in the past, the response time of most lcds was between 20ms and 50ms, and the adverse effects of this relatively long interval could be noticed during playback of dvds or when playing games that required especially quick scene changes. you would, for example, find that fast-moving objects would cause ghosting, particularly when black objects passed through a bright-colored background. image frequency and the human eyethe human eye will perceive a series of sequential images displayed at a frequency of 30hz (30 images, or frames, per second) as continuous, as is the case with movies (24 frames per second). screen images displayed at 60hz will offer even more comfortable viewing, but careful scrutiny will reveal a slight sense of "flickering", as is the case with the ntsc television standard (which displays at 60 frames per second). according to standards set by vesa (video electronics standards association), the frequency necessary to achieve flicker-free display with a crt is 72hz. most vga cards and software applications, in order to accommodate the use of crt monitors, have working frequencies set at 75hz. in the past, the lcd monitors with 16ms response time that predominated in the market supported frequencies only up to 63hz (1/0.016), making their display performance inferior to that of crt monitors. avid gamers therefore continued to use crt monitors. lightning fast response time: 12msbenq's new fp767-12 and fp783 lcd monitors represent a breakthrough, having reduced response time to a mere 12ms. the lcd panels used in them can support a display frequency of 83hz (1/0.012). coupled with benq's sophisticated electronic design, this allows benq's lcd monitors to achieve the full performance potential of their hardware, enabling them to fully support the 75hz working frequency of vga cards, as well as their targeted applications. the amazingly fast 12ms response time made possible by benq lcd monitors provide exceptionally fluid video without flickering and other visual artifacts. the result is that dynamic game and movie scenes displayed at 75 frames per second appear without breaks, offering display quality fully the equal of a crt monitor's.gaming today's most popular games-whether racing titles such as 2 fast 2 furious, first-person shooters like half-life: counter-strike or unreal tournament 2, or sports games such as nba live 2004-demand speed and fast responses. taking 2 fast 2 furious as an example, if your lcd's response time is slightly slow, you may notice a momentary blurring of the track or even a double-image of your racecar when you accelerate to shoot past another racer. not only is the visual experience of the game marred, but these effects may even lead to a mistake in driving judgment that could mean the difference between victory and defeat.moreover, when you are playing a first-person shooter game such as counter-strike, if the time between discovery of an enemy combatant and firing your weapon is delayed by even milliseconds, it can mean the difference between survival or adding yourself to the bodycount. smart gamers know the advantage of having an lcd monitor with a fast response time. and benq's 12ms response time give you that crucial edge at the moment of truth!today's popular games that demand ultra-fast display response times: 10. pixel error classes close open the new standard ensures transparency with regard to pixel errors by defining pixel error classes. they must be noted in a deviceâ019s technical details. with this standard the producer obliges himself to not exceed a fixed pixel error quota during line production. errorclass type 1** type 2*** type 3**** i 0* 0* 0*

(2,62) 7 (6,55) 1. what is ips display?closeopen ips stands for in-plane switching. in-plane switching was developed by hitachi ltd. in 1996 to improve on the poor viewing angle and the poor color reproduction of tn panels at that time.[6] its name comes from the main difference from tn panels, that the crystal molecules move parallel to the panel plane instead of perpendicular to it. this change reduces the amount of light scattering in the matrix, which gives ips its characteristic wide viewing angles and good color reproduction.[7] initial iterations of ips technology were plagued with slow response time and a low contrast ratio but later evolutions have made marked improvements to these shortcomings. because of its wide viewing angle and accurate color reproduction (with almost no off-angle color shift), ips is widely employed in high-end monitors aimed at professional graphic artists, although with the recent fall in price it has been seen in the mainstream market as well. 2. what is mva display?closeopen mva stands for multi-domain vertical alignment. multi-domain vertical alignment was originally developed in 1998 by fujitsu as a compromise between tn and ips.[citation needed] it achieved pixel response which was fast for its time, wide viewing angles, and high contrast at the cost of brightness and color reproduction. modern mva panels can offer wide viewing angles (second only to s-ips technology), good black depth, good color reproduction and depth, and fast response times due to the use of rtc (response time compensation) technologies. when mva panels are viewed off-perpendicular, colors will shift, but much less than for tn panels. there are several ""next-generation"" technologies based on mva, including au optronics' p-mva and a-mva. analysts predicted that mva would dominate the mainstream market, but the less expensive and slightly faster tn overtook it. the pixel response times of mvas rise dramatically with small changes in brightness. less expensive mva panels can use dithering and frc (frame rate control). 3. do you have advise if the gamma setting of gl2040m can be put for the setting 2.3?closeopen the gamma setting can’t be adjusted as 2.3, because it’s the default setting as 2.2, 2.4, 2.6.. 4. [ew2430] if i am using the d-sub input and then i select dvi from the input menu, the monitor blacks out for a moment, then shows ""input: d-sub"". so it is not taking the pc video signal input. alternatively, if i select hdmi 1, the monitor shows ""input: hdmi 1"". if i then select dvi from the input menu, the monitor blacks out for a moment, then shows ""input: d-sub"". so whatever i do, it won't accept the dvi signal.closeopen ew2430 supports the full hd -1920(h) x 1080(v) resolution with dpms (display power management system) and senseye function. the monitor supports maximum resolution up to 1920x1080 with vga input, and 1920x1080(1080p) with digital、hdmi(digital) inputs , 1080p with hdmi(video). 5. why when using dvi/hdmi cable on my v2420, the black colour looks more grey ( not true black), but when using vga cable the black colour is real black?closeopen "it might be because the graphic card (display card) has different setting for digital & analog input. the user may try to upgrade the latest graphic card driver and adjust the brightness or contrast setting of the graphic card." 6. what do p, np, fs, o in timing table mean?closeopen p stands for “preset mode” and is the preferred setting. np is ""non preset"" mode that the monitor supports and image can be displayed. fs: fail save mode. the image can still be displayed but may not be able to displayed correctly because it’s out of range. ""out of range"" will be shown. o: out of range. the monitor does not support, and no picture would be shown. therefore, the resolution with p is the preferred setting. 7. what is display port?closeopen displayport is a digital display interface standard produced by the video electronics standards association (vesa). the specification defines a royalty-free digital interconnect for audio and video. the interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor or television set. the first version 1.0 was approved by vesa on may 3, 2006. two updated revisions have since been approved starting with 1.1a on april 2, 2007 followed by the current standard 1.2 on december 22, 2009. displayport is designed to replace digital visual interface (dvi) and video graphics array (vga), as well as replace internal digital lvds links in computer monitor panels and tv panels. displayport can also provide the same functionality as hdmi but is not expected to displace hdmi in high-definition consumer electronics devices. most of the displayport supporters are computer companies including apple, dell, hp, lenovo, fujitsu, toshiba and acer, some of which have released several computer monitors that support displayport and some also with hdmi. in december 2010 it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including intel, amd, dell, lenovo, samsung and lg would stop using lvds from 2013 and legacy dvi and vga connectors from 2015, replacing them with displayport and hdmi. likewise, hp expects that displayport will completely displace vga and dvi by 2013. however, many are still using those connectors, so it doesn't seem to have much effect right now. most laptops still have hdmi and legacy vga ports, but not displayport or dvi. in 2010, benq launched bl2201pt, bl2201pu, bl2400pt & bl2400pu that support dp 1.1a. 8. what is the viewing angle of has of bl2201pt?closeopen you may position the screen to the desired angle with -5° to +20° monitor tilt, 90° (left and right total) monitor swivel, and 130 mm monitor height. 9. how does eco sensor of bl2201pt work? closeopen eco sensor detects users' presence in front of the monitor within the set range. if the sensor detects no presence, the monitor is turned off in 40 seconds to save power. if the monitor is turned off by the eco sensor, the power button flashes in green. if the eco sensor detect no presence for over 2 hours, the monitor will be powered off. press the power button to turn on the monitor. 10. the osd controls are inaccessiblecloseopen • to unlock the osd controls when the osd is preset to be locked, press and hold the “enter” key for 15 seconds to enter the “osd lock” option and make changes. • alternatively, you may use the  or  keys to select “off” in the “osd lock” submenu from t site map legal notices contact us copyright © 2009 benq corporation. all rights reserved. ™ product names, logos, brands, and other trademarks are the property of their respective trademark holders.
