(general) product line lcd monitors projectors category general troubleshooting manual search questions expand all contract all 1. what is ips display? close open ips stands for in-plane switching. in-plane switching was developed by hitachi ltd. in 1996 to improve on the poor viewing angle and the poor color reproduction of tn panels at that time.[6] its name comes from the main difference from tn panels, that the crystal molecules move parallel to the panel plane instead of perpendicular to it. this change reduces the amount of light scattering in the matrix, which gives ips its characteristic wide viewing angles and good color reproduction.[7] initial iterations of ips technology were plagued with slow response time and a low contrast ratio but later evolutions have made marked improvements to these shortcomings. because of its wide viewing angle and accurate color reproduction (with almost no off-angle color shift), ips is widely employed in high-end monitors aimed at professional graphic artists, although with the recent fall in price it has been seen in the mainstream market as well. 2. what is mva display? close open mva stands for multi-domain vertical alignment. multi-domain vertical alignment was originally developed in 1998 by fujitsu as a compromise between tn and ips.[citation needed] it achieved pixel response which was fast for its time, wide viewing angles, and high contrast at the cost of brightness and color reproduction. modern mva panels can offer wide viewing angles (second only to s-ips technology), good black depth, good color reproduction and depth, and fast response times due to the use of rtc (response time compensation) technologies. when mva panels are viewed off-perpendicular, colors will shift, but much less than for tn panels. there are several ""next-generation"" technologies based on mva, including au optronics' p-mva and a-mva. analysts predicted that mva would dominate the mainstream market, but the less expensive and slightly faster tn overtook it. the pixel response times of mvas rise dramatically with small changes in brightness. less expensive mva panels can use dithering and frc (frame rate control). 3. do you have advise if the gamma setting of gl2040m can be put for the setting 2.3? close open the gamma setting can’t be adjusted as 2.3, because it’s the default setting as 2.2, 2.4, 2.6.. 4. [ew2430] if i am using the d-sub input and then i select dvi from the input menu, the monitor blacks out for a moment, then shows ""input: d-sub"". so it is not taking the pc video signal input. alternatively, if i select hdmi 1, the monitor shows ""input: hdmi 1"". if i then select dvi from the input menu, the monitor blacks out for a moment, then shows ""input: d-sub"". so whatever i do, it won't accept the dvi signal. close open ew2430 supports the full hd -1920(h) x 1080(v) resolution with dpms (display power management system) and senseye function. the monitor supports maximum resolution up to 1920x1080 with vga input, and 1920x1080(1080p) with digital、hdmi(digital) inputs , 1080p with hdmi(video). 5. why when using dvi/hdmi cable on my v2420, the black colour looks more grey ( not true black), but when using vga cable the black colour is real black? close open "it might be because the graphic card (display card) has different setting for digital & analog input. the user may try to upgrade the latest graphic card driver and adjust the brightness or contrast setting of the graphic card." 6. what do p, np, fs, o in timing table mean? close open p stands for “preset mode” and is the preferred setting. np is ""non preset"" mode that the monitor supports and image can be displayed. fs: fail save mode. the image can still be displayed but may not be able to displayed correctly because it’s out of range. ""out of range"" will be shown. o: out of range. the monitor does not support, and no picture would be shown. therefore, the resolution with p is the preferred setting. 7. what is display port? close open displayport is a digital display interface standard produced by the video electronics standards association (vesa). the specification defines a royalty-free digital interconnect for audio and video. the interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor or television set. the first version 1.0 was approved by vesa on may 3, 2006. two updated revisions have since been approved starting with 1.1a on april 2, 2007 followed by the current standard 1.2 on december 22, 2009. displayport is designed to replace digital visual interface (dvi) and video graphics array (vga), as well as replace internal digital lvds links in computer monitor panels and tv panels. displayport can also provide the same functionality as hdmi but is not expected to displace hdmi in high-definition consumer electronics devices. most of the displayport supporters are computer companies including apple, dell, hp, lenovo, fujitsu, toshiba and acer, some of which have released several computer monitors that support displayport and some also with hdmi. in december 2010 it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including intel, amd, dell, lenovo, samsung and lg would stop using lvds from 2013 and legacy dvi and vga connectors from 2015, replacing them with displayport and hdmi. likewise, hp expects that displayport will completely displace vga and dvi by 2013. however, many are still using those connectors, so it doesn't seem to have much effect right now. most laptops still have hdmi and legacy vga ports, but not displayport or dvi. in 2010, benq launched bl2201pt, bl2201pu, bl2400pt & bl2400pu that support dp 1.1a. 8. what is the viewing angle of has of bl2201pt? close open you may position the screen to the desired angle with -5° to +20° monitor tilt, 90° (left and right total) monitor swivel, and 130 mm monitor height. 9. how does eco sensor of bl2201pt work? close open eco sensor detects users' presence in front of the monitor within the set range. if the sensor detects no presence, the monitor is turned off in 40 seconds to save power. if the monitor is turned off by the eco sensor, the power button flashes in green. if the eco sensor detect no presence for over 2 hours, the monitor will be powered off. press the power button to turn on the monitor. 10. the osd controls are inaccessible close open • to unlock the osd controls when the osd is preset to be locked, press and hold the “enter” key for 15 seconds to enter the “osd lock” option and make changes. • alternatively, you may use the  or  keys to select “off” in the “osd lock” submenu from t previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 site map legal notices contact us copyright © 2009 benq corporation. all rights reserved. ™ product names, logos, brands, and other trademarks are the property of their respective trademark holders.
