projector lamps are a consumable item and dim as they age. to increase lamp life: 1. ensure there is adequate clearance near the intake and exhaust vents. 2. use the eco modes when possible. 3. avoid frequent switching of on and off of projector. 1 2 why does projector have black line or flicker on the display? you can verify if the the issue by checking benq splash screen. if the issue is there, the problem is more thqn likely with the projector. 2 3 please don't place the projector in any of the following environments. 1. space that is poorly ventilated or confined. allow at least 20 inch clearance from walls and free flow of air around the projector. 2. locations where temperatures may become excessively high, such as the inside of a car with all windows rolled up. 3. locations where excessive humidity, dust, or cigarette smoke may contaminate optical components, shortening the projector's life span and darkening the image. 3 4 after covering the lamp lens while projector is on, the image is now blurred. covering the the lens while the lamp is projecting can cause the light reflection to dissolve the projector lens. 4 5 can i leave my projector turned on 24/7? you can leave your projector on 24/7 if you want to. as long as the projector is operating under normal operating conditions (clean, relatively dust-free environment, and there is sufficient ventilation around projector) the lamp will have the greatest likelihood of lasting through its entire rated lamp life. 5 6 what is benq short-throw technology? thanks to the special aspherical lens, short-throw projectors only require half the projection distance of traditional projectors! with its short-throw ratio lens precisely calculated and positioned, short-throw projectors deliver large-screen projection in tight spaces without jeopardizing picture quality or decor. 6 7 what is the difference between dlp projectors and lcd projectors? dlp (digital light processing) is the exclusive technology of the texas instruments, adopting the principle of mirror reflection to present images. it has the advantages of filter-free, full digitization, high contrast, fine image, small volume, and long-lived life, etc. generally speaking, dlp technology has a lower total cost of ownership and is supported by award winning hollywood directors and producers. 7 8 why is the lamp is not as bright (or dimmed) after using for a period of time? light bulbs (lamps) are a consumable item and naturally dim as they age. sometimes resetting the lamp and projector can help with brightness. unplug the projector for 15 minutes, remove lamp cover and lamp for 3 minutes, and then reinstall and plug everything back in. using the eco modes will also help extend brightness and lamp life. 8 9 what reason will cause lamp to breakdown? if the projector is continuously used for a long period of time under poor ventilation/air flow to sufficently keep the projector cool, will effect the performance of the projectors screen brightness as well as lamp life. 9 10 how long is the life-span of the light bulbs of the projector? the typical life expectancy of a lamp is approximately 1500~2000 hours, depending on the usage. after 2000 hours, the efficiency of the light bulbs can and may decline to 70%. it is recommended the consumer to replace light bulb after lamp has reach its hour maximum. the built-in lamp hours timer is a safety timer that helps to keep the consumer aware of the hour usage. 10 11 how do i clean the lens? avoid wiping lens with abbrasive materials that may scratch the lens surface. also using non approved liquids and solvents may effect the special coating on lens surface. gently blowing air to remove dust on lens and using a microfiber cloth is a safe method. 11 12 the lamp is not on but the fan remains running, what is happening? this can be a precautionary measure when the projector was not properly shut down. the fan may fun for a few minutes to cool down the system. you will have to wait until this process is finished before you can power your projector on. 12 13 can i use the projector in a smoky and dusty environment? we strongly suggest not to install the projector in environments with excessive humidity, dust or cigarette smoke. this can cause darkening of the image and possibly shorten the lifespan of the projector lamp. 13 14 what's different between native resolution and supported resolution? the native resolution is the horizontal by vertical pixel count. for example, if the resolution is 1920x1080, that means there are 1920 horizontal pixels by 1080 vertical pixels on the dmd chip. the real pixels depend on the resolution of a dmd-chip. for supported resolutions, the projector could have the native dmd chip with 1024 x768 native resolution, but it can support higher resolutions 1280*800 or higher via the ddc timing ic and software translatation. thus the 1024 x768 is the native resolution and any resolution higher or lower is the supported resolution. 14 15 projection is blurry, what can i do? 1. the projection lens is not correctly focused. adjust the focus of the lens using the focus ring. 2. the projector and the screen are not aligned properly.adjust the projection angle and direction as well as the height of the unit if necessary. 3. there may be dust accumulated on lens. refer to "how do i clean the lens?" 4. the lens cap is still attached to the lens. remove the lens cap. 15 16 how to change the lamp? allow for 45 minutes of cooldown if projector has been in use. please follow these steps: 1. turn off the main power source and unplug power cable. 2. loosen the screws located under the cover of the light bulb with a screwdriver. 3. loosen the screws that fasten the light bulbs. hold the handles of both sides of the bulb, take out the screws carefully. 4. put in the new bulb and fasten the screws that were originally used to hold the light bulb. 5. fasten the cover of the light bulb below the projector with the original screws 6. please do not turn on the power before covering the light bulb with the cover because of safety considerations. 16 17 why does projector have some noise? noise normally heard are generated by: 1. color wheel which spins to create the colors. 2. projector fan that ventilates and helps cool down the system. an intelligent fan control system is used to automatically adjust the speed of the fan. sometimes when the projector is used for an extended period of time, the fan control system will automatically increase in fan useage. 17 18 my projector powers off randomly. what is causing this? 1. ensure that the front lamp cover is attached correctly. 2.this may be a precautionary measure that the projector is over heating. ensure there is adequare ventilation and the projector is operating under the normal operating conditions (clean, relatively dust-free environment). 18 19 my projector is suffering auto shutdown, what can i do? two reasons this may be happening: 1. indicator "lamp" lights - the light bulb or lighter may be damaged or causing problems. 2. indicator "temp" lights - alert from the temperate control section. might be because the fan has stopped spinning or the temperature is too high. 19 20 the projection is out of position or not displayed in full, what can i do? following options may improve the image performance. 1. set your projector to the native resolution. 2. set the optimum refresh rate and resolution. 60hz is the most suggested optimum refresh rate. 3. adjust keystone. 4. perform an auto adjustment by pushing the auto adjust button on your projector or remote controller might help to solve this problem. 20 21 why projector shows "usb display detected", but no image is displayed on the screen ? the auto run program might be blocked by your companies security system. there is a couple of options you can try that may resolve your issue (1) click "my computer" and select "qpresenter" disk and execute "auto run.exe" (2) go to microsoft webpage to install the auto run software (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c680a7b6-e8fa-45c4-a171-1b389cfacdad&displaylang=en) 21 22 why is my monitor flickering? please follow the steps below. 1. check if video and power cables are secured tightly. try gently moving the cables at the connector back and forth to check for faulty cable or pins in connector. 2. try another video and power cable 3. check for electrical interference around monitor. fans, florescent lights, radios, etc. 4. ensure that the graphics card is securely attached. 5. optimize refresh rate (hertz) in graphics card setting. 22 23 why are some tv boxes unable to display on lcd monitor? some lcd models cannot handle the higher refresh rates that some set top boxes put out (example : samsung), and some tv boxes do not have the capability to switch from 50hz to 60hz. the refresh rate is just around 50hz. (example: 49.9hz) the monitor not display. typically, the display will function normally only when the refresh rate of the tv box is higher than the lcd. 23 24 what is ghosting/blurring and why does it happen? an issue that mostly affects games, ghosting is due to pixel response. if an lcd does not update a pixel (or in the case of screen, a lot of pixels) fast enough, the old image is still super-imposed when the new one is applied. ghosting is more noticeable when a dark object is ontop of a light background. 24 25 why is my screen blurry/stretched when i change resolution? monitors, projectors, and tvs use pixels to display an optimal resolution depending on the equipment. when the native resolution is changed, image can become distorted. 25 26 what is "out of range" in lcd? this usually occurs when the hertz(hz) or resolution is unsupported. try lowering the resolution and/or hz in the display settings. 1. control panel -> display -> setting -> advance -> monitor -> change frequency to 60 hz. 2. control panel -> display -> setting -> change resolution supported by monitor 26 27 i-key and geometry key unable to function after using dvi connection when you use digital interface for the display, the signal transmitted is in digital format. therefore the signal transmitted is very accurate and automatically adjusted. that is the reason the function is grayed out. 27 28 does lcd monitor support the feature of hanging on the wall? our products support wall hanging feature. different models have different hanging methods. most our models have 4 standard vesa hanging holes at the back cover abling you to setup the support rack according to the size. 28 29 display brightness is uneven lighting from the environment and the view angle can alter the perception of display brightness. please adjust the brightness and contrast to default settings. then, place in a dark environment and view at a range of 1 foot to see if brightness is still uneven. 29 30 what is a dead/bright/dark pixel? synonymous in effect, a dead pixel is one that does not properly change colors - it is stuck to white. a stuck pixel is one which continually displays the same color, no matter what is on the screen. if this occurs, call customer assistance for warranty questions. 30 31 is it necessary to install driver for lcd monitor? the monitors can be used without installing drivers. the drivers can be used to display the benq logo on the screen, and may improve or upgrade the display quality. 31 回到顶部 about benqthe brandbenq groupglobal officesabout csreco-friendly productsgreen lifecommitmentfollow usfacebook gamingfacebook pro-av youtubetwitter copyright @ benq corporation. all rights reserved. united states - englishsite mapprivacy policy cookie policy virtual patent marking this website is best viewed using internet explorer 11 , chrome , firefox, safari and other newer browsers version.
