free residential & liftgate service no sales tax charged for customers who reside outside the state of wisconsin. all orders that total $100 or higher qualify for free ground or free freight shipping (exceptions described below). in order to provide exceptional shipping and handling to our customers, we offer $8.87 flat rate shipping & handling on all orders less than $100.  this fee covers expenses for order processing, handling, packaging and shipping. the flat fee approach allows us to provide quick shipping and a clear, simple checkout without complicated or variable shipping and handling charges.  at equipatron our primary carriers are ups ground, fedexground, and united states postal service, which we have found to be the most reliable residential carriers. when your order ships we will notify you via email. included in your email will be a tracking number for your shipment. we encourage you to track your shipment online or on the phone with ups, fedex, and usps. be sure to contact us if anything seems unusual with the progress of the shipment. you can also track your packages via order status on equipatron.com. depending on how close you are to the shipping warehouse, your item will arrive in 1 to 6 business days after it leaves the warehouse.  if you want an item left at your doorstep, the best thing to do is leave a note on your door asking the driver to leave your package with "no signature required." be sure to include your name and tracking number on the note-----but we don’t recommend this. the most important thing to remember about truck freight is that you should inspect the package at the time of delivery. if the box has any damage, or if there is any reason for you to be at all concerned about potential damage, please write "product damaged" clearly on the sheet that they ask you to sign. this simply insures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the problem. if you are ordering a large item, around 200 pounds or more, we are providing free liftgate service to your residence. alternatively, most of our competitors will charge you extra $50 - $100 for this service. shortly after you receive your tracking information via email, a representative from the designated freight carrier will call you to schedule a convenient delivery time. in order to keep your costs down and our pricing simple, we provide free shipping in the united states (lower 48 only). the price you see in the shopping cart is the price you pay, with one exception: if you are shipping an order to wisconsin we have to add sales tax. beware of companies who mask their shipping charges and surprise you with prohibitive shipping and handling fees or oversize charges at the end of the checkout process. make sure you know the total cost of your purchase when shopping around. if you live in alaska or hawaii, please call us and we will quote you a freight surcharge prior to placing an order. * all mi-t-m products sold to a california address are subject to ca state sales tax. email deals weekly sales, specials and exclusives equipatron will not sell, trade, share or rent your email address. company about us careers government secure shopping privacy policy return policy price match policy order security terms & conditions my account order status order payments shipping & delivery help buyer's guide help/info contact us buy online or call: 1-855-264-6487 copyright © equipatron. all rights reserved. equipatron is upfront talk to mefast answers for your urgent questions. phone:855-264-6487 mon-fri 8 am -
