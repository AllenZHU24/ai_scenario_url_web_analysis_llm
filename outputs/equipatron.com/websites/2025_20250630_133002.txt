(see the data security section above for more information). another example involves faxes. if you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. there are other ways we could learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information), and this policy doesn't discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses. as we mentioned, we primarily sell merchandise, not information, and we will try to treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.update to this policy if we change or update this privacy policy, we will post changes and updates on this site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, use and disclose. we encourage you to review this privacy policy from time to time so you will know if the privacy policy has been changed or updated. company company about us careers blog secure shopping secure shopping privacy policy return policy order security terms of service help help contact us my account shipping & delivery newsletter sign up for special offers, diy tips and more! email join equipatron © 2025 powered by shopify american express apple pay discover google pay mastercard paypal shop pay venmo visa
