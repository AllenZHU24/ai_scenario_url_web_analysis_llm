briggs & stratton 33s877-0019-g1 vertical engine with electric start. this motor was purchased as a replacement for my craftsman lawn tractor. i found the b&s model on the equipatron web. i contacted them as i had some questions about installation. customer service was super friendly and not in any hurry to get me off the phone! they answered all my questions, some of which needed the person to contact a more technical type. i installed the motor in my machine. installation went very smooth you do have to have some base mechanical knowledge to get the job done. there should be a install note to remove that screw that stops the throttle from hitting the choke mechanism. electrically it was super easy, plug and play! overall, working with equipatron was great, and the product is 5 stars!! briggs & stratton 33s877-0019-g1 vertical engine with electric start, replaces 33r877-0003-g1 bill rickard 11/14/2024 honda gxh50 qxa horizontal engine honda gxh50 qxa horizontal engine kevin s 11/11/2024 great experience! mitch from equipatron did a great job. i sent an email asking about an engine that wasn't really right for my application and mitch was able to quickly assess what i needed and point me in the direction of the right engine (as well as the required accessories). my order was processed and delivered quickly and, when i found a minor part had been damaged during shipping, mitch quickly got a replacement sent to me with no questions asked. i'll definitely use equipatron again. thanks!
