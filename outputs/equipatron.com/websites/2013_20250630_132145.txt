whatever the reason, you won't be stuck with an item you cannot use or that you do not want. we are proud to offer one of the best return policies in the online business. you may return your equipment, engine or accessory purchase within 30 days of receipt for an exchange or a refund of the purchase price excluding our shipping and handling costs. on replacement parts you have up to 365 days to return your items. here’s how it works. returned merchandise must have a return material authorization (rma) #. please call our toll free number and speak with a customer service representative to obtain a rma # and shipping instructions. we will credit your payment account within 10 days of receiving the returned item. unopened merchandise: you may return "unopened" equipment, engines and other whole goods products and accessories within 30 days of delivery for a refund. on replacement parts (components of equipment or engines) orders, you have up to 365 days to return an "unopened" part purchase for a refund. you will be responsible for both the original outbound shipping & handling charges as well as return shipping charges. restocking fees of up to 20% may still apply for some items such as engines. opened merchandise: "opened" products and accessories can be returned within 30 days of delivery*, but will be subject to a 20% restocking fee to cover re-sale expenses. you will be responsible for both the original outbound shipping and handling charges as well as return shipping charges. opened returns must be in "like new" condition (re-sellable) with all original materials. you are also responsible for returning the product in the original packaging or packaging that is of equal quality to the original. if product has been used the product cannot be returned. engines: engines that have been either mounted, fueled or run can not be returned. if an engine is found to be defective, you must follow the manufacturer's warranty process. engine powered equipment: due to federal shipping regulations, engine powered equipment can not be returned once it has been gassed or oiled. if the product has been gassed or oiled, it needs to be taken to an authorized service center for repair which may be covered under the terms of the manufacturer’s warranty. for additional information please call our toll free number and speak with a customer service representative who will be happy to assist you. cancelled orders: unfortunately, any order that has already shipped cannot be cancelled and if an order is refused, it will then fall under our standard return policy, where shipping & handling costs will be deducted from your refund. damaged products: please take the time to inspect the goods before you sign the delivery receipt from the carrier. suspect damage: sometimes, the outer carton may appear damaged, but the product inside the box is perfectly fine. if you suspect concealed damage, notate “possible freight damage” on the delivery receipt while the driver is present. this way, if you discover later that the product is damaged, the freight claim is less of a hassle. obvious damage: do not sign for damaged products. if your product arrives damaged, please (1) refuse delivery and (2) call us immediately so we can process the appropriate claims and coordinate an exchange for you. product operation: we recommend that you operate your product within 7 days of receipt so we can respond to any issues if there are any. if you think your product is defective, don't worry as many perceived issues are common can be resolved easily over the phone. email deals weekly sales, specials and exclusives equipatron will not sell, trade, share or rent your email address. company about us careers government blog secure shopping privacy policy return policy price match policy order security terms & conditions sitemap my account order status order payments shipping & delivery help buyer's guide help/info contact us buy online or call: 1-855-264-6487 copyright © equipatron. all rights reserved. equipatron is upfront
