i've tried memory foam (hard/hot), down (won't stay fluffed), off brand, name brand, purple pillow etc. this pillow is by far the most comfortable for me. i have neck problems and this pillow is amazing. i also sleep hot and this pillow stays cool.michelle hernandezborger, tx | may 19, 2017like a cloudevery morning i have woken up with this pillow has been amazing. it's like sleeping on a cloud all night long. i haven't had any neck pain and i've had the best, most restful sleep i've had in years. i can't wait to purchase a bed after i save a little more.melissa klarcincinnati, oh | march 7, 2017see all reviewsgreat sleep, made simplerisk-free trialwe’re confident you’ll love your casper, so we give you 100 nights to try it on us or we’ll pick it up and give you a full refund.free shipping & returnsfree shipping is included with every order. returns are free, too. and we do our best to donate every returned mattress to a local charity.exceptional customer servicewe’ve got more than 40 snooze specialists available seven days a week to answer every question under the moon.frequently asked questionsdo i need to fluff the pillow?yes, it’s best to fluff your pillow often (daily, if possible) to keep it looking and feeling fresh. our pillow’s fill is specifically designed so that it can be revived and returned to its original puffiness with just a quick fluff.how do i clean my casper pillow?cleaning the casper pillow is easy: step 1: unzip the outer pillow and remove the inner pillow. step 2: zip the outer pillow back up. step 3: place both in the washing machine. step 4: wash with warm water and a mild detergent on the gentle cycle. run the rinse cycle twice. tumble dry low with dryer balls (or clean tennis balls).what’s the best pillow for my sleep position?our research shows nearly everyone shifts around during the night, so casper set out to design a single pillow that could accommodate all sleep positions. whether you like to sleep on your side, back, or stomach, you’ll feel supported by the casper pillow.see all pillow faqsyour cartyour cart is emptyshop now>pillowsaboutpressjobssupportfaqcontact usreturnsaffirm financingwarrantystorescasper storestargetread moreblogwoollyfollow casperfree bedtime readingsubmitplease enter a valid email address.thanks!
