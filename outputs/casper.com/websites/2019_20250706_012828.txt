options to cover all your bases.the foundation + metal framethe basics for your new mattress. foam mattresses don't sit well on old box springs, so you'll need a foundation instead. complete your set with a metal frame if you don't have one already. explorethe platform & upholstered bed framean alternative to a foundation and metal frame. you can choose between the platform or the upholstered bed frame for an added touch of style.the adjustable & adjustable pro bed frameskip the foundation and platform bed frame, and opt for the most customizable sleep option. with an adjustable frame, you'll get the ultimate sleep experience. explorealready have a frame?if you have a frame at home, make sure you use a firm, non-spring foundation or a bed frame with slots that are less than 4 inches apart.
