options to cover all your bases.the foundation + metal framethe basics for your new mattress. foam mattresses don't sit well on old box springs, so you'll need a foundation instead. complete your set with a metal frame if you don't have one already. explorethe platform & upholstered bed framean alternative to a foundation and metal frame. you can choose between the platform or the upholstered bed frame for an added touch of style.the adjustable & adjustable pro bed frameskip the foundation and platform bed frame, and opt for the most customizable sleep option. with an adjustable frame, you'll get the ultimate sleep experience. explorealready have a frame?if you have a frame at home, make sure you use a firm, non-spring foundation or a bed frame with slots that are less than 4 inches apart. any other kind of box spring or bed frame won't give your foam mattress the support it needs. we also don't recommend putting your mattress directly on the floor.closepick your perfect feel without
