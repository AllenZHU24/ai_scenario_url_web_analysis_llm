(“casper”) and purchased directly from casper or casper’s authorized retailers (the “mattresses”). some parts of this limited mattress warranty also extend to covers sold with mattresses (“mattress covers”). mattresses are designed to work on a firm, solid-surface, on a bed base that is structurally capable of supporting the weight of the mattress and user(s). this mattress warranty does not cover your product if you use it in a manner incompatible with that intended design.b. who this mattress warranty extends tothis limited mattress warranty extends to the original purchaser of any mattress. all casper warranties, including any implied warranties, are valid only for the period of time the mattress is owned by the original purchaser of the mattress. the “original purchaser,” for

structurally capable of supporting the weight of the mattress and user(s).d. what this limited mattress warranty coversthis limited mattress warranty applies to the following defects:deterioration causing the mattress to have a visible indentation greater than one (1) inch that is not associated with an indentation or sag which results from use of an improper or unsupportive foundation or adjustable bed base. normal wear requires that a mattress be continuously supported by a matching foundation or adjustable bed base with a proper bed frame sufficient to support the collective weight of the mattress and foundation.any physical flaw in the mattress that causes the foam material to split or crack, despite normal usage and proper handling.any manufacturing defect in the zipper assembly of the mattress cover.this limited mattress warranty does not cover the following:a normal increase in softness of the foam pressure-relieving material which does not affect the pressure-relieving qualities of the mattress.comfort preference.physical abuse or damage to the structure and/or cover material, including but not limited to, burns, cuts, tears, liquid damage, or stains; provided, that the defect is caused by such abuse or damage.replacement of any non-defective pieces in the casper sleep system (for example, if you purchase a mattress with multiple components

retailers.mattresses sold “as-is”, “preconditioned”, “reconditioned”, “used”, “comfort return”, “returned”, “previously owned”, or any other similar wording indicating that the mattress is not “new” or of “first quality”, or has previously been purchased or used by another consumer.in the event of a defect, casper’s sole and exclusive liability and your sole remedy under this limited mattress warranty will be, at casper’s option, to provide a repaired or replacement mattress or mattress cover, subject to your fulfillment of “your responsibilities” below. replacement mattress covers may be

(as applicable) and ship your mattress or upgrade mattress back to you. you will be responsible for any shipping costs associated with shipping replaced or repaired mattresses.replaced or repaired mattresses that are not upgrade mattresses are subject to the same limited mattress warranty as the original mattress. for example, if you obtain a replaced or repaired mattress that is the same style
