mattress to have a visible indentation greater than one (1) inch that is not associated with an indentation or sag which results from use of an improper or unsupportive foundation or adjustable bed

exclusions may not apply to you. you may also have other rights that vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as set forth in this limited mattress warranty, in no event will casper or its suppliers be liable for procurement of substitute products or other special, incidental, consequential or indirect damages arising out

purchase, receipt, order or use of any casper products through binding arbitration, as fully set forth in the casper terms and conditions found at casper.com/terms, and as stated herein. arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. this agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this mattress

claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the aaa rules. in that case, you agree to reimburse casper for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.no class actions. you and casper agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a
