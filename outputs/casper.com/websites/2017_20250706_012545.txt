chris jackett verified casper owner reading 45 years old 14 nov, 2017 quit procrastinating (like it did for months), just try it! i've had this a good few weeks now, and i can say without doubt it is the best mattress i have ever owned or slept on. i sleep on my side, back and front, and it is extremely comfy no matter how you sleep on it. well worth the money, and much better in my view than any traditional spring mattress. only negative is, it would be nice if the courier could provide a rough delivery time, as you can't really leave it in a safe place or with a neighbour. 6 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo very good benjamin tate verified casper owner stanton 26 years old 14 nov, 2017 very good my partner suffers from back pain and we have found that the mattress helps. will be buying for other beds in the house. 9 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog very comfy alison verified casper owner wirral 09 nov, 2017 very comfy i've had the mattress a month and i'm loving it. at first i was worried it would be too soft but it supports me perfectly and i wake up ache free every morning. 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo plus a cat extremely comfortable mattress malcolm and vicki patr... verified casper owner evesham 70 years old 06 nov, 2017 extremely comfortable mattress i was amazed by how heavy the box was when it was delivered! had to recruit some stronger younger people to get it upstairs. it seemed amazing that a super king size mattress could fit in a box of that size! we undid the box, undid the wrapping and the mattress exploded into life! it took surprisingly little time to become full size. the first night we had a good night's sleep and ever since we have had great nights sleep. excellent product - thank you 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog amazing mike brook verified casper owner sandbach8 48 years old 31 oct, 2017 amazing my first night last night sleeping on my casper. was amazed as i didn't wake up through the night with aching shoulders and slept through the night. also i normally wake with a bad back and this morning i didn't. great value and money well spent. might be tempted to get my dog one too. 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo excellent mattress lesley, mark & 2 toy p... verified casper owner chesterfield 58 years old 27 oct, 2017 excellent mattress so easy to order online and fast delivery. the mattress arrives rolled up in a box, which makes it easy to roll it into position onto the bed. within a few hours it had regained its full shape and was ready to use. there was no horrible smell from the mattress unlike a lot of other memory foam mattresses. the mattress itself is made of excellent quality materials and looks superb. it is so comfortable to lie on although at first seemed to be a little too firm for me. after getting used to it i find it to be just right. my husband and i are both large people and the mattress supports us (and the 2 dogs) perfectly. we also both suffer from fibromyalgia and back pain and this mattress certainly eases the pain and gives us a good night's sleep. it is a heavy mattress which makes it a little difficult to rotate, but it is so worth it for the comfort you get. i would highly recommend it to everyone. thanks for all you do. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog customer service second to none jason verified casper owner 51 years old 21 oct, 2017 customer service second to none we recently ordered a casper mattress and the whole process of buying the mattress, to organising the mattress to be collected, was an amazing experience. the mattress was too soft for our needs, however casper were fantatstic as we had had the mattress for 8 weeks before our john lewis bed frame arrived (i wish john lewis were as efficient as casper). after a month, of trying the mattress on the new bed frame, we contacted casper who arranged collection and the refund in less than 7 days. the whole process was seamless, i can not recommend their customer service highly enough and as soon as they have a firmer mattress we will be purchasing one straight away. however our daughter isn’t pleased......... because she loved the casper mattress !!!!!!!!! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner absolutely brilliant june abbott verified casper owner perth 67 years old 19 oct, 2017 absolutely brilliant when my mattress arrived i couldn't wait to unbox it easy peasy no hassle hubby one side of the bed me on the other and wallah it was done. my old mattress i have to say was an ikea one and very comfortable but was getting a bit sad looking hence trying the casper. got into bed the first night and was pleasantly surprised i thought it was going to be hard but no it was very comfortable for me and hubbs, just right we both suffer with osteo athritis in our spine and also our hips so this mattress was heaven sent i noticed a difference straight away less pain in my back and hips by the end of the week i was more or less pain free and getting out of bed was easier didn't need any help from hubbs at all so didn't need to do the 100 day trial it was the right mattress for us cosmo,monkee (cats) & tilly (dog) love it too. thank you casper 10 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner we love the mattress. marc lamb verified casper owner featherstone 38 years old 18 oct, 2017 we love the mattress. we had a really tough financial year and at one point we're homeless. we finally were able to buy a good mattress this year and so love the comfort compared to the old one we bought that hurt our backs...it was in budget but it makes our casper mattress that much sweeter. 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner so comfortable, slept the best i have in a long time kevin trebell verified casper owner redruth 46 years old 11 oct, 2017 so comfortable, slept the best i have in a long time i have just changed to a casper as my old memory foam had become soft and wasn't very supportive anymore. having compared reviews i decided casper was the one for me. myself and my wife are delighted. it is cooler than our previous, more supportive and yet some comfortable and easily the best sleep either of us have had in a long time. there is a slight aroma which quickly fades but that's a tiny thing... love this mattress. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 … › » questions? we're on call visit our help page to call, email, chat, or text us. get in touch shop the mattress try the casper mattress at home for 100 nights, risk free. see the mattress
