casper mattresses are developed by a team of sleep obsessed engineers and designers, plus a certified professional ergonomist. we have two rules: everything we design must be tested and must help sleep. over the past 10 years we have taken valuable feedback from sleepers like you to design the best products for a great night’s rest. our zoned support system provides optimal spinal alignment without sacrificing comfort — allowing you to choose between the comfy “on the bed” feel of the dream and a cozy “in the bed” experience with the snow. the dream max and snow max have also earned endorsements from american chiropractic association so you can rest assured, no matter your sleep needs, casper’s got you covered.we pioneered the 100 night trial and easy return process, but we also have incredible sleep shops where you can book a nap and try our products in person. whether you stop by a store or give us a call, our sleep specialists are here to help build the bedroom of your dreams! what is a mattress in a box? how long does it take for a casper mattress to expand? a mattress in a box is a mattress that’s compressed in an air-sealed bag and rolled tight so that it can fit into a box that’s easier to maneuver than a traditional mattress. allowing you the flexibility and convenience of picking your mattress online and having it easily delivered to your door.when you receive the mattress, all you’ll need to do is pull it out of its packaging, lay it flat on your bed frame or floor, and let it expand.foam and hybrid mattresses can be slept on almost right away but may take up to 48 hours to expand fully. our snow mattresses are primarily made with memory foam and can take up to 72 hours to expand fully. how long will my casper mattress last? every casper mattress is engineered for both comfort and durability, our premium foams (and innerspring coils inside our hybrid mattresses) provide lasting support for a full decade—our warranty backs it up. how do casper mattresses cater to different sleep positions? casper mattresses are designed to support you no matter what position you sleep in! our zoned support™ technology works to offer support to the areas that need it most, with varying zones of softness and firmness at the right body touch points to keep your spine aligned. whether you consider yourself to be a side, stomach, or back sleeper, we've got you covered. can you expedite shipping?
