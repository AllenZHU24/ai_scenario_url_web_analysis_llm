a product defect. for more information, see terms.are mattresses on sale in-store and online?closeyes! you can find our mattresses on sale in over 50 retail locations in the united states and canada or online from the comfort of your pjs.which mattress size is best for me?closeto choose a mattress size, consider how big your bedroom is and if you share it with a partner, children, or pets. typically, twin mattresses are ideal for children and single adults. twin xl mattresses are better for students in college dorms, or you can combine two for the ultimate split king adjustable bed.  full mattresses are perfect for adults with snug bedrooms or guest bedrooms, but our most popular mattress size is the queen. for those with partners, pets, or children, the king or california king are our most spacious mattresses. still unsure? check out our mattress size comparison guide.which pillow is best for my sleep position?closewhether you like to sleep on your side, back, or stomach, the original casper pillow, the down pillow, and the foam pillow are designed to support you. the down pillow’s outer chambers offer fluffy, airy comfort, while the inner chambers provide healthy support for your neck. together they create a luxurious feel that adapts to any sleep position. the original casper pillow's buoyant core and plush, resilient outer layer are uniquely designed to support all sleeping positions. the foam pillow is designed specifically for optimal neck alignment. its air channels also circulate air out and away, making it a great option for those that sleep
