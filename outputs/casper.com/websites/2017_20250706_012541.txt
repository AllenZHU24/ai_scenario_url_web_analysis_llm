shipping and free returns in the us and canada“supremely comfortable”cool by designcool by designunlike traditional memory foam mattresses, the casper is designed to help you sleep cool. the open-cell top layer uses convection and conduction to flow heat away from your body. similarly, the memory foam layer leverages airflow to pull heat out of the top layer, leaving you cool and comfortable.open-cell top layer & airflow regulationwhy does heat flow matter?while you’re asleep, your body acts like a little thermal engine, putting out the equivalent heat of a 100w light bulb. by using foams that leverage convection (heat transfer through air) and conduction (heat transfer through solids), we’re able to pull heat away from your body, and disperse it back into the atmosphere.sleep now, pay laterto make it even easier to get better sleep, you can finance your casper through affirm.*easy monthly paymentsflexible paymentspay your monthly bill using a bank

bedthe waterproof mattress protectorguards against dirt, spills, and normal wear and tearshopthe foundationprovides excellent support and can be assembled in minutesshopthe metal bed frameworks with our foundation to create a complete sleep setupshopfrequently asked questionswhat setup do you recommend for the casper mattress?we designed the casper mattress to be versatile, so it can work with all standard foundations. as with all foam beds, you want as much direct support under the mattress as possible. a wooden slatted or platform bed offers the most support. for optimal support under all sizes ( twin, twin xl, full, queen, king, cal king ) , we suggest using the casper foundation.why is the casper mattress better than its lookalikes?the engineering behind casper products goes far beyond aesthetics. our mattresses are the result of intensive research and continuous development by our 30-person san francisco r&d team, who collectively hold more than 50 patents. unlike putting a cover over an off-the-shelf construction, our approach allows us to quickly respond to customer feedback and continually enhance our products. as a result, the original casper mattress has received high praise from consumer reports, was named one of time magazine’s best inventions, and holds multiple industrial design awards.does the casper mattress have any safety or environmental certifications?all the foams in casper mattresses are certipur-us® certified. these foams are made without ozone depleters, pbde flame retardants, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates regulated by the consumer product safety commission. they are low voc (volatile organic compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million).see all mattress
