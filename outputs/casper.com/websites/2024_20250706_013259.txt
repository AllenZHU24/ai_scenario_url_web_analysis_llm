casper mattresses are developed by a team of sleep obsessed engineers and designers, plus a certified professional ergonomist. we have two rules: everything we design must be tested and must help sleep. over the past 10 years we have taken valuable feedback from sleepers like you to design the best products for a great night’s rest. our zoned support system provides optimal spinal alignment without sacrificing comfort — allowing you to choose between the comfy “on the bed” feel of the dream and a cozy “in the bed” experience with the snow. the dream max and snow max have also earned endorsements from american chiropractic association so you can rest assured, no matter your sleep needs, casper’s got you covered. we pioneered the 100 night trial and easy return process, but we also have incredible sleep shops where you can book a nap and try our products in person. whether you stop by a store or give us a call, our sleep specialists are here to help build the bedroom of your dreams! how long will my casper mattress last? every casper mattress is engineered for both comfort and durability, our premium foams (and innerspring coils inside our hybrid mattresses) provide lasting support for a full decade—our warranty backs it up. what is a mattress in a box? how long does it take for a casper mattress to expand? a mattress in a box is a mattress that’s compressed in an air-sealed bag and rolled tight so that it can fit into a box that’s easier to maneuver than a traditional mattress. allowing you the flexibility and convenience of picking your mattress online and having it easily delivered to your door.when you receive the mattress, all you’ll need to do is pull it out of its packaging, lay it flat on your bed frame or floor, and let it expand.foam and hybrid mattresses can be slept on almost right away but may take up to 48 hours to expand fully. our snow mattresses are primarily made with memory foam and can take up to 72 hours to expand fully. how do casper mattresses cater to different sleep positions? casper mattresses are designed to support you no matter what position you sleep in! our zoned support™ technology works to offer support to the areas that need it most, with varying zones of softness and firmness at the right body touch points to keep your spine aligned. whether you consider yourself to be a side, stomach, or back sleeper, we've got you covered. what kinds of bed frames are compatible with casper mattresses? casper mattresses are designed to work on a firm, solid surface like our foundation, platform, or adjustable bed frame. having the correct support ensures the performance and longevity of memory foam/hybrid mattresses.for slatted frames, we recommend using bed slats that are flat (not bowed), wooden, and no more than 4 inches apart. i have specific medical problems. how will your mattresses work for me? as our casper mattresses are not considered medical devices, we always recommend consulting with your medical professional regarding your specific needs. every medical condition is unique in nature, but we’ve had many casper mattress customers report relief in back pain! the orthopedic mattress design of the dream max and snow max have also earned endorsements from the american chiropractic association.feel free to browse our reviews to find other sleepers with similar medical concerns to find the best mattress for you. what does the mattress protection plan cover? the protection plan covers stains, rips, and tears from any single incident. this includes spilling coffee in bed, ink stains, and common accidents from children and pets. there’s no deductible and no limit on the number of claims you can make. that means that no matter how many times you move, or how many times you have breakfast in bed, you’ll be covered. what is the snow technology used in casper cooling mattresses? from casper labs, our most advanced solution to nighttime overheating combines heatdelete™ bands, phase change material, and a cooling snow cover to keep you comfortably cool from the moment you crawl into bed. what should i do with my old mattress when i buy a new one? if your old mattress is on the way out but you're not sure what to do with it, we've got some ideas! did you know that your old mattress can be recycled? before disposing of your mattress, look into your state's policies for mattress removal, as that will be the most environmentally friendly option. if you are not able to recycle it, consider donating your mattress and any accessories like a mattress topper or box spring to a local charitable organization so that your mattress can go to someone in need. other options include reselling it, repurposing it, or throwing it away responsibly.for more information, read our guide on how to dispose of a mattress. what is the zoned support™ technology in casper hybrid mattresses? zoned support™ is engineered to keep your spine in ergonomic alignment by providing support where your body needs it most, with firmer foam under the hips, waist, and lower back. zoned support max™ combines our firmer center foam with a second layer of precisely cut channels to cradle the natural curve of your body while adding support to your hips, waist, and lower back for the ultimate ergonomic relief with our hybrid memory foam design. products mattresses pillows bed frames adjustable bed frames sheets duvets cooling collection glow light dog bed shop by size twin twin xl full queen king cal king size guide support contact us faq returns trial warranty financing protection plan replacement parts order history about why casper?
