casper mattresses?we designed every casper mattress to be versatile, so it can work with all standard foundations. as with all foam beds, you want as much direct support under the mattress as possible. a wooden slatted or platform bed offers the most support. for optimal support under all sizes (twin, twin xl, full, queen, king, cal king), we suggest using the casper foundation.what mattress size do you recommend?beyond personal preference, there are various factors to take into account before picking a mattress size that’s perfect for you. you should ask yourself: how big is your bedroom? do you share the bed with a partner or pets? is living space or sleeping space more important to you? we’ve laid out all these details in our handy mattress size guide.i have hip and shoulder pain, which is the right mattress for me?the casper wave's proprietary technology is designed to help relieve pressure points associated with hip and shoulder pain. the wave’s firmness contributes to ergonomic support, comfort, and spine alignment. while we have a team full of designers and engineers, we aren't medical doctors. pain can stem from a variety of causes, so be sure to confirm any medical issues with your doctor.is casper the best mattress available online?with over 30,000 reviews on google trust stores for customer experience and 12,000+ mattress reviews on our site, we’re confident in our products. we have a continuous flow of customer feedback and data that our san francisco r&d team uses to improve the casper. the team shares more than 50 patents, and their work on the casper has earned tens of thousands of 5-star reviews. and we don't just sell mattresses, we have pillows, glow lights, bed frames and more!let's get ready for bedvisit a storewe’ve

make sure you get the best sleep of your life, we offer three bed frame options to cover all your bases.the foundation + metal framethe basics for your new mattress. foam mattresses don't sit well on old box springs, so you'll need a foundation instead. complete your set with a metal frame if you don't have one already. explorethe platform & upholstered bed framean alternative to a foundation and metal frame. you can choose between the platform or the upholstered bed frame for an added touch of style.the adjustable & adjustable pro bed frameskip the foundation and platform bed frame, and opt for the most customizable sleep option. with an adjustable frame, you'll get the ultimate sleep experience. explorealready have a frame?if you have a frame at home, make sure you use a firm, non-spring foundation or a bed frame with slots that are less than 4 inches apart. any other kind of box spring or bed frame won't give your foam mattress the support it needs. we also don't recommend putting your mattress directly on the floor.closepick your perfect feel without compromising comfort or supportsofterhybrid (foam + springs)the spring base layer in our hybrids results in a slightly
