it's firm and yet soft and comfy at the same time. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo best mattress ever (so far!) daniel adam verified casper owner bryan 51 years old dec 22, 2016 best mattress ever (so far!) we had an expensive mattress that was nearing its life (15 years) a very expensive pillow top that was probably the best you could get 15-ish years ago, it was not cheap and i remember going omg! that cost more than my first car! anyway, we did a bit of research and started seeing people posting about casper and even my kids had a favorite youtube star who was promoting it so we checked out the website and well 100 day free trial and the price was one fifth of what we were looking at. so boom we ordered! it got here and well the box seemed small for a king bed, well opening it up revealed a big-@$$ bed! that was cool and a great way to ship, easy to move around the house and get to the room (before opening that is!) so at first we found it a bit warm and changed the layers we had on our bed (blankets, etc.) and well i loved it but something was still missing, we realized since we travel a lot and are in hotels 3 days a week (nice places) we needed a mattress topper (yes try it). we loved the marriott mattress topper and ordered one from shopmarriott . com and we now have the absolute best bed in the world. the casper and the topper have created something i can only describe by the fact that i sleep all night (1030-ish to 630-ish) and feel good not sleepy. so love the mattress and looking at them for our 3 boys this year as well as the topper. you really should look at the marriott topper and have a similar casper topper :) 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner a casper haiku heather c. verified casper owner palmer 41 years old dec 22, 2016 a casper haiku a casper haiku bed by mail? it's true. pressure is high. will we rest? best sleep of my life. we debated memory foam for a long time. my husband discovered casper and we decided to go for it. i have joint pain (hips and knees)but since sleeping in the casper bed, i have not woken up with any pain. i'm a believer! thank you casper. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner the best in the west korbo verified casper owner 53 years old dec 22, 2016 the best in the west from ordering on line to the first night, all excellent. sometimes i wake up for few seconds just to tell myself how good i sleep and back to my dreams. love it. 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo plus a dog great mattress for a better price! rance campbell verified casper owner 22 years old dec 21, 2016 great mattress for a better price! casper mattress got it right folks. this is probably the last mattress you will buy. i work in the trades and my back takes a beating most days. my brother recommended getting a casper and i thought sure what have i got to lose? i received my mattress, unboxed it (that in itself was mind blowing), and set it up. my wife and i sleep on a queen mattress. after about a couple weeks i thought the mattress was mostly hype because it didn't change much. by the end of the first month my back quit aching and i was sleeping like a baby. my wife had a similar experience. i didn't realize how big the difference was until i slept a few days on a different bed while on vacation. the casper mattress completely outperforms in my opinion. it is an amazing mattress especially for the money. you owe it to yourself to try it out! it won't take the full 100 days for you to realize the difference! 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner read all reviews free shipping & returns free delivery to your door in the us and canada same-day white glove delivery in nyc, sf, and la more bedtime reading sign up to receive our monthly snoozeletter and other updates submit how we designed the perfect mattress see the process 0% apr financing with casper and affirm have teamed up to provide interest-free financing on your order. easy monthly payments get a real-time decision. pay over six months with 0% apr. flexible payment pay your monthly bill using a bank transfer, check, or debit card at affirm.com just select ‘pay with affirm’ at checkout. offer codes are not valid for use by customers that elect to finance their purchase through affirm. financing is based on the advertised purchase price at 0% apr, paid over 6 months. excludes tax fees, which are calculated at checkout. white glove delivery we offer white glove delivery in parts of la, sf, and nyc*. schedule your mattress delivery at a time that works for you. select an available delivery window. if you order before 3pm, you could be sleeping on your casper as early as tonight. we'll send you an email with confirmation and delivery information. your mattress will be delivered right to your door, and our couriers will set it up and remove any packaging. see if white glove delivery is available in your area you can still get free ups shipping. sweet!
