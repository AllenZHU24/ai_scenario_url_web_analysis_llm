:-) 7 hours of sleep per night kind of expected more brandon laraby verified casper owner 36 years old jan 03, 2017 kind of expected more was super excited to receive my casper pillow, i've tried all sorts of different ones in my quest for a good night's sleep. honestly, i can't tell a whole lot of difference from my standard pillow. the outside is soft, sure, but the support core is really underwhelming. overall an attractive package and great marketing but, so far, i'm not convinced that this pillow is the end-all that it's being sold as. 7 hours of sleep per night this will be traveling with me from now on! sandy sisk verified casper owner waldorf 37 years old jan 02, 2017 this will be traveling with me from now on! my husband said, as we sunk into the pillow on our new bed that it was "like being at a fancy hotel." these pillows are fantastic and so comfy. i will be taking this with me whenever i travel from now on! i miss it when i don't have it. 7 hours of sleep per night surprisingly comfortable! stephanie verified casper owner hudson valley 59 years old jan 02, 2017 surprisingly comfortable! i, like many others have been in pursuit of the perfect pillow for what seems like forever! i decided to give the casper a try since there are so many reviews that are pretty good! i have used the pillow for about 10 days and really like it. the title of my review is "surprising comfortable" because it is a firmer pillow than i usually prefer since i have used down pillows for a long time. since sleeping on this pillow i have not woken up with neck discomfort at all. it's comfortable for reading and does not feel like i am sleeping on a board. i think i have found the near perfect pillow for my sleep habits!
