kayleen, vinny & lucy verified casper owner le roy, ny 47 years old 12/20/2015 aaaaahhhh! it was very eat to unwrap. just make sure you have it in place- that makes it easier. it's quit heavy. our old box spring worked fine. there was barely an odor as mentioned in some reviews. slept on it right away. it's is truly hard to describe. it's very firm but very soft. in a word~ comfy! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog finally a full night sleep and pain free morning! treacie s. verified casper owner port lavaca, tx 43 years old 12/20/2015 finally a full night sleep and pain free morning! after sleeping on only spring type mattresses, we didn't know how we would adjust to a casper. i suffer from back issues and neck pain due to multiple accidents, so i wake up with pain every morning. the first night sleeping on the casper was amazing and i adjusted immediately - even pain free the next morning. my husband took about a week to adjust, but now loves it as much as i do. it stays nice and cool and the best part - you cannot feel the other person moving!! i would definitely recommend this mattress to friends and family! planning to purchase the pillows after christmas! 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog wish we bought it awhile ago! deacon tom lang verified casper owner hummelstown , pa 52 years old 12/20/2015 wish we bought it awhile ago! there's nothing about this purchase i don't like. it was easy to purchase online, we received prompt delivery, the packaging was awesome and the unpacking instructions were excellent. from the very first night i no longer woke up with back stiffness, discomfort or aches like i did daily with our former pillow top mattress. we like it so much that i bought two pillows also for us as a christmas present, but we haven't tried them yet. i even suggested to casper that they make and sell pet beds! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog best sleeping decision rich stanfel verified casper owner deerfield, il 51 years old 12/20/2015 best sleeping decision the best decision i could have made. definitely was skeptical and nervous to make such a big purchase and decision on a mattress shipped in a box to my home. all went well and the mattress and sleep overwhelmingly exceeded my expectations. i am, and will continue to recommend casper for those that are seeking an upgrade to their current sleep challenges. not one bad thing to say. my experience was perfect and my spouse proclaims the same view. look forward to getting into my bed every night! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner plus a dog the wife loves it jay speagle verified casper owner englewood, co 43 years old 12/20/2015 the wife loves it my wife loves the matress and has been sleeping better than she has in years. i, however, can't get a good night's sleep. i toss and turn all night and get up with a very sore back. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner glad to have it pamela zuteck verified casper owner clear lake shores, tx 59 years old 12/19/2015 glad to have it a reviewer said it was fun to open, it is. another reviewer said it was a very firm mattress, it is. my husband, who has lost a lot of weight during chemo, didn't last the 1st night. i dug out the target memory foam topper we used with the old mattress, and we have both slept like babies from night 2 on. we'll be keeping our casper. 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner incomparable! maya malbacias verified casper owner columbia, tn 41 years old 12/19/2015 incomparable! we looked like kids opening a big present! it was just an experience from the start! i've been talking to friends and families about this awesome casper! 5 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner wonderful nights sleep s shockley verified casper owner lynchburg, va 63 years old 12/19/2015 wonderful nights sleep unboxing was uneventful. wife and i adjusted to the new mattress right away. just the right amount of firmness and softness as desired. hard to explain. one has to experience to understand. 9 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner great mattress! michael and natalie or... verified casper owner calabasas, ca 53 years old 12/18/2015 great mattress! very easy to unbox the mattress. our concern was that wife's previous experience with foam mattress was negative. however, once we tried this casper cal-king, it was blissful sleep from the start. we don't know about load factor or cradling different body parts. all we wanted was a good sleep. and boy does this new casper ever deliver! well worth the price. highly recommend casper to friends and family! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner really a nice mattress. the very best of 6 we've had since 2003. lee tokrud verified casper owner cannington, on 83 years old 12/17/2015 really a nice mattress. the very best of 6 we've had since 2003. the boxing, delivery, ordering process and quality, everything exceeded our previous experiences. if any of our friends or family mentions the word "mattress", we'll recommend casper 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner they promised ... and delivered. dan aviv verified casper owner toronto, on 45 years old 12/17/2015 they promised ... and delivered. this is truly a marvellous sleep experience! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps solo okay, still on the fence anonymous verified casper owner washington, dc 70 years old 12/17/2015 okay, still on the fence unboxing was uneventful. i was disappointed immediately that the bottom is such that you cannot flip the mattress. i was also stupefied that you omitted handles, too; i would have used them to turn the mattress. so you make it hard, too. i would have preferred a firmer mattress. my spouse likes it more than i do. i think it is well made and does not feel like memory foam, which i would have not liked. it is next to impossible to slide yourself because you make a temporary impression. i also noticed considerable similarity between the warranties of my old, conventional mattress and yours. so, there are some things to like and not to like. i will think it over. 6 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner wasn't sure if we would both like it. sharon kittle verified casper owner lodi, wi 75 years old 12/17/2015 wasn't sure if we would both like it. we weren't sure it would work for us because he likes very firm and i like pillowtops, but with the 100 day trial period, we had to give it a try. it was awesome. neither of us are waking up in the middle of the night to use the restroom! we have been waking up refreshed and ready for the day ahead of us. thank you casper. we have already told people about it! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner i am in love.... pam & john verified casper owner danielsville, ga 63 years old 12/17/2015 i am in love.... with my casper! i had delayed replacing our mattress because we couldn't agree about soft vs hard but this mattress works great for both of us. it is beyond comfortable - even from the 1st night. have had it now for 3 mos & my husb & i both sleep great & wake without the back/neck pain that had become the norm. if you are looking for a mattress, ordering a casper is a no-brainer due to the generous return policy. thank you casper! 8 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner very comfy! sandy baker verified casper owner new hudson, mi 67 years old 12/17/2015 very comfy! we love our casper mattress. delivery was fast and the set up was quick and easy. right out of the box, the mattress was ready to sleep on and it is very comfy! even though casper has a 90 day return policy, no questions asked, we will not be returning our mattress. i finally found a mattress that i can sleep on all night and my body doesn't hurt when i wake up! i would definitely recommend this mattress to friends and family, in fact i already have! 7 hours of sleep per night sleeps with a partner 1 2 3 … › » questions? we're on call visit our help page to call, email, chat, or text us. get in touch shop the mattress try the casper mattress at home for 100 nights, risk free. see the mattress about press team jobs blog design support help returns faq financing showrooms new york city west hollywood venice free bedtime reading submit © 45 bond st. new york, ny 10012 privacy terms 888–498–0003 contact us
