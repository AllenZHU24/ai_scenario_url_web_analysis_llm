mattress is designed for comfort and support, but each has unique benefits to suit your individual sleep style and preferences. for example, hot sleepers may prioritize the benefits of snow technology in casper’s cooling mattresses. sleepers with aches and pains might look to the unmatched support of the wave hybrid mattress, while those who are looking to upgrade to a higher quality mattress at a cozy price could consider the the casper mattress.our bed mattresses are great for any type of sleeper- side, back, and stomach sleepers. our high density foam options provide pressure relief, and our hybrid mattress options offer the perfect amount of support for a good night's sleep.if you’re not sure where to start, take the mattress quiz, or find a casper mattress store near you and book a virtual appointment with one of our sleep specialists to find your perfect mattress. what is a mattress in a box? a mattress in a box is a mattress that’s compressed in an air-sealed bag and rolled tight so that it can fit into a box that’s easier to maneuver than a traditional mattress. allowing you the flexibility of picking your mattress online and having it easily delivered to your door.when you receive the mattress, all you’ll need to do is pull it out of its packaging, lay it flat on your bed frame or floor, and let it expand. which mattress size is best for me? buying a new mattress is not a one-size-fits-all situation, so it’s essential to evaluate your individual needs to find the right mattress for you. if you have a history of back pain or sleep problems, you may want a free trial period to help you make sure you’re comfortable with your new mattress.here are some major factors you will want to consider when choosing a mattress.your room sizethe amount of space available to you should be considered. a larger mattress will take up more space, so plan accordingly and ensure there is plenty of space in your bedroom for your mattress.below are the mattress sizes in square inches and square feet.twin: 2,925 sq. in./20.3 sq. ft.twin xl: 3,120 sq. in./21.7 sq. ft.full: 4,050 sq. in./28.1 sq. ft.queen: 4,800 sq. in./33.3 sq. ft.king: 6,080 sq. in./42.2 sq. ft.california king: 6,048 sq. in./42 sq. ft.your body sizeyou should take your height and width into consideration when choosing a mattress. a typical twin mattress is 75 inches tall, while a twin xl is 80 inches tall. if an individual is taller than six feet two inches, a twin mattress is probably not for them. instead, it’s best to go with the xl, full, queen, or king bed—all of which can accommodate a sleeper who is up to 6 feet 7 inches.those that are taller than 7 feet should opt for a california king bed. for those who want more space on either side of their body, a full, queen, or king bed will be the most comfortable.your budgetthe amount of money you are willing to spend on a mattress can also help you choose the right size. buying a mattress that meets both your size needs and your financial needs is key.still unsure? check out our mattress size comparison guide what are hybrid mattresses? a hybrid mattress combines the pressure relief of foam with the sturdy feel of resilient springs for added support and bounce. what is memory foam? memory foam is a synthetic material known for its use in bed mattresses (although it’s also used in bedding, shoes, and furniture). its soft, durable, and heat-wicking abilities provide support for aching joints and have made it popular with sleepers of all body types and sleep styles. how do i keep my mattress clean? use protectionusing a mattress protector is a no-brainer to guard against dirt, spills, and normal wear and tear. we developed a water resistent mattress protector that conforms through the sides to keep it pristine. the best part? it won’t compromise the comfort of your bed.give it a bathwhile we don’t recommend trying to wash it yourself, there are plenty of professionals out there who can get the job done. we recommend contacting your local mattress cleaning service and scheduling a convenient home visit.keep it smelling freshto keep odors in check, air out the mattress by freeing it from the sheets and opening a few windows. for serious smell situations, consider sprinkling baking soda on the cover, then vacuuming it away before putting the sheets back on.keep out dust with fitted sheetsuse fitted sheets to protect your mattress from dust, dirt, and dead skin. this will help keep your allergies at bay and ensure that dust mites don’t find a new home.rotate your mattressalong with regular cleaning, periodically rotate your mattress head-to-foot (180°) every six months to make sure it wears evenly. there’s no need to flip a casper mattress — each layer is strategically designed for your comfort and not to be flipped. what does the mattress protection plan cover? the protection plan covers stains, rips, and tears from any single incident. this includes spilling coffee in bed, ink stains, and common accidents from children and pets. there’s no deductible and no limit on the number of claims you can make. that means that no matter how many times you move, or how many times you have breakfast in bed, you’ll be covered. what should i do with my old mattress when i buy a new one? if your old mattress is on the way out but you're not sure what to do with it, we've got some ideas! did you know that your old mattress can be recycled? before disposing of your mattress, look into your state's policies for mattress removal, as that will be the most environmentally friendly option. if you are not able to recycle it, consider donating your mattress and any accessories like a mattress topper or box spring to a local charitable organization so that your mattress can go to someone in need. other options include reselling it, repurposing it, or throwing it away responsibly.for more information, read our guide on how to dispose of a mattress. i have specific medical problems. how will your mattresses work for me? as our casper mattresses are not considered medical devices, we always recommend consulting with your medical professional regarding your specific needs. every medical condition is unique in nature, but we’ve had many, many casper mattress customers report relief in back pain!feel free to browse our reviews to find other sleepers with similar medical concerns to find the best mattress for you. why do casper mattresses need a foundation? a foundation ensures that mattresses sleep like they should. some older box springs or foundations don’t provide a solid surface, causing mattresses to be affected from the breaks in support. a strong and level foundation helps mattresses to perform at their peak for a decade or more, no matter what kind of bed frame they sit on.casper foundations and mattresses are the perfect pair. we spent over a year developing the casper foundation, so its design has the same considerations as our mattresses and is designed to have the right support for all of our mattresses. feel the difference find your store products mattresses pillows bed frames adjustable bed frames sheets duvets cooling weighted blanket
