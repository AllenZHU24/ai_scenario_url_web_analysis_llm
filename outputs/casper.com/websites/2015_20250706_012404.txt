"crunchiness" is something new and i don't like it. second problem which i just discovered: i washed the pillow cover this morning, and am shocked that there is a thick layer of loose fill in it. now that it is out of the wash machine, it is a clumped mess. the issue has gotten better with spending time in the dryer, but it will never be the same. i've been playing with it to get it to even out for a while now, and this is truly annoying. who the heck thought it was a good idea to put a bunch of loose fill into the cover!!?? a padded pillow cover is a good idea, but it should be secured with channeling or boxing, as you would do with a comforter. same principle as to why. i would never recommend this pillow to anyone. firm comfort jay kelly verified casper owner jamaica, ny 30 years old march 7, 2016 2:48am firm comfort by far the best pair of pillows i've owned. have not had the need to wake up in the middle of the night to flip the pillow. pillows are, breathable and constructed of noticeably high quality materials making them a value purchase. looking forward to purchasing a king sized mattress when i move into new home. 5 hours of sleep per night at long last... dan collins verified casper owner chicago, il 67 years old march 2, 2016 5:24am at long last... how many types of pillows have i tried over the years? so many. every new idea has found it's way under my head but i never really liked any of them. until now. what a simple idea of a firm pillow within a softer one. it really works for me, a side sleeper who tosses about a lot. the pillow has mass that is lacking in any other. it is extremely resilient and cradles your head in comfort. i am so grateful to have finally found the perfect pillow for me. 9 hours of sleep per night overpriced standard pillow alex verified casper owner redmond, wa 33 years old february 29, 2016 7:07pm overpriced standard pillow i tried this pillow for several weeks and can now clearly say it's a good quality standard pillow you can find almost everywhere. nothing spatial or different than any other pillow out there. while it seems the construction of this pillow is kind of sophisticated "pillow wishing pillow", the overall look and feel of it is just like any other good quality "dawn alternative" pillow you may find. we returned it just because the price doesn't worth it. you can find same support quality pillows for under half the price of casper pillow. read all reviews free shipping & returns free ups delivery to your door in the us and canada change your mind? no problem, returns are free and easy more bedtime reading sign up to receive our monthly snoozeletter and other updates submit how we designed the perfect pillow see the process >pillows about press team jobs blog design support help returns faq financing warranty showrooms new york city refer & earn give $50, get $50 free bedtime reading submit © 45 bond st. new york, ny 10012 privacy terms 888–498–0003 contact us call us text us
