from dueling pianos to raffle prizes, fun was definitely had by all. although many of my pictures turned out blurrier than some party goers’ vision by the end of the night, i’ve posted and captioned a few decent ones below… a nearby hotel’s banquet room provided the setting for the evening. a huge thanks goes out to our lovely hr ladies, jackie and emily, for all of the preparations! probably the best part of our holiday party is the chance for everyone to mingle and chat with people they don’t get a chance to talk to often. it’s also wonderful meeting everyone’s spouse or significant other. it’s a tradition among the shipping department (and a few others) to come wearing their ugliest holiday sweaters. this year was no exception. you have to admit, though, they are a pretty good looking bunch! jimmy emceed the night and thanked everyone for their hard work. even if you barely know jimmy, you can probably guess that he threw out a few funny jokes, too. he also generously donated a 46″ lcd tv to our raffle, which was won by our purchasing manager, chris! since jimmy is a pilot and aviation enthusiast, we all pitched-in and bought him a remote controlled plane! this is after — a few weeks ago — he managed to “land” his remote control helicopter on the roof of our building. let’s hope he has a little more “captain sullenberger” in him with this toy. as was the case last year, the dueling pianos were a hit! they sang and serenaded the night away, from lady gaga (jimmy’s request, of course) to classic rock to holiday hits. as you can tell in the last picture, they also managed to squeeze in a little roasting throughout the night. for them to play a request, it was suggested that we tip them a few dollars. we arranged with them, however, that all of these tips would benefit the make-a-wish foundation. by the end of the night, we raised almost $400 to donate to this very deserving cause! of course, a shopjimmy holiday party wouldn’t be a success if it didn’t end with a little karaoke! we want to thank you, our customers, for your support and continued business this past year. this celebration of our hard work and success wouldn’t be possible without your loyalty, feedback, and belief in our company and products. we want to wish you all a very happy and healthy holiday season!
