"scratch & dent" / refurbished tvs we call our tvs "scratch & dent" because they may include various cosmetic defects: screen scratches, dead pixels, lines, or repainted cabinets. please note that these are not "refurbished" tvs, and we can't detail individual defects for each tv. using a little industry lingo, these tvs are called "c stock" units. we do allow returns (within 90 days of order date) on defective "scratch & dent" and refurbished tvs. a defective tv simply does not function properly: the volume doesn't work, the set doesn't turn on, etc. "defective" does not include any of the cosmetic defects described above. if your tv is defective, here's what you can do: - contact us and we'll send you a return shipping label (on our dime) and rma number. - we will then try to replace the tv with the same tv make and model. if we're out-of-stock on that make and model, we will try to fix it. - if all else fails, we will gladly ship you another tv (same size) of a like or better make and model. again, we don't accept returns on working "scratch & dent" or refurbished tvs. we appreciate your understanding. if you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. expired credit cards / store credit if your credit card expires before the date of your refund, we will give you shopjimmy store credit that matches the full amount of your refund. store credit can not be redeemed for cash or check. defective / warranty claims every tv part we sell is backed by a 180-day warranty (replacement dlp lamps carry a 12-month warranty). this warranty protects you from dead-on-arrival (doa) and defective tv parts. if your tv part fails within its allotted warranty, please file a warranty claim with our returns department. to do this, please email us (returns@shopjimmy.com) with the following information: your order number, tv model number, original part number, and defective claim. our returns department will then issue you a return authorization number (rma number) via email and walk you through the returns process. for security purposes, all of our tv parts are marked with our shopjimmy identifier, so your warranty claim will be visually inspected for that identifying marking. if this marking is not present on the tv part(s), the claim will be denied and you will be notified by phone. if your warranty claim is accepted, we will send you a replacement part(s). if we do not have a compatible, replacement part in-stock, we will refund you: - within 3 months of your order date: we will refund you in full via the payment method you used to place the order. - after 3 months (and up to the end of the warranty period): we will refund you in full via shopjimmy credit, which can be used toward future shopjimmy purchases with no expiration. if you are a certified technician and your warranty claim is denied, you will be charged the return shipping cost (the cost of the return shipping label). our restocking fee (20% for non-registered technicians) may also apply to denied warranty claims. returns insert don't have our shipping insert with our returns policies and checklist? download it here to avoid a denied return! the file may take a minute to download on a slower internet connection, so please be patient if it doesn't display immediately. compare products you have no items to compare. address 9201 penn ave s. suite 40 bloomington, mn 55431 work (952) 881-6492 toll free (877) 881-6492 phone hours mon-fri   (8am-8pm cst) saturday (8am-6pm cst) sunday   (9am-4pm cst) fax (952) 884-5028 sales questions sales@shopjimmy.com returns/exchanges returns@shopjimmy.com aol im with shopjimmy social media shopjimmy.com/blog twitter.com/shopjimmy facebook.com/shopjimmy youtube.com/shopjimmy about shopjimmy we, shopjimmy, are the global leader in tv parts and accessories, front projector lamps, and refurbished tvs distribution. our goal is to deliver the highest quality, lowest-priced tv parts and products, reduce e-waste, and continue our mission to make you happy. shipping policy | returns policy | privacy statement 952-881-6492 | 877-881-6492 | sales@shopjimmy.com © 2012 shopjimmy.com, llc. all rights reserved. 74.86.97.130
