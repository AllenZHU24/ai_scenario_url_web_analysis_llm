a: here's an example for a sony search: for sony models, we typically list them as "kdl-xxxxxxx", allowing you to search as broadly or specifically as you want. if you type "kdl-40", you will see a list of parts for all 40" bravias. if you type "kdl-40s", you'll narrow your search to the s series of 40" bravias. if you type "kdl-40s2100" or "kdl-40s3000", you'll find the specific model. return to top q: what if the part i want is out of stock? a: if you go to that part's product page, you'll see a "request this tv part" button. this will direct you to a form to complete. if/when we receive that part, we'll make sure to contact you immediately. return to top q: do you offer tech support? a: no. at this time, we don't offer tech support. if you have a part question, please contact our parts manager, nate (nathan@shopjimmy.com). return to top q: what if i'm not sure which part i need? a: nate is our extremely knowledgeable parts manager. email him (nathan@shopjimmy.com) with any questions. return to top common questions q: do you have a catalog? a: no. we don't have a catalog. since our inventory changes rapidly, it's easier for us to stay up-to-date if we display our inventory online. and we like saving trees. return to top q: do i need a customer account to make a purchase? a: yes. to make an online purchase, you do need to create a customer account. not only does this help us manage orders, but it simplifies and accelerates future orders. click my account at the top right of any page to start the quick process. all of your information is secure and safe. we'll never give your contact information to third parties. for added security, we do not keep your financial information on file. return to top q: how do i set-up a customer account?

a: yes. we will beat any in-stock, distributor price (with a 90-day warranty) by 15%. if you see a lower price online, call or email us. show us the link to our competitor’s page with their pricing, and if they have a 90-day warranty and the part is in-stock, we’ll beat that price by 15%! return to top q: do you price match ebay sellers? a: yes and no. we review these on a case-by-case basis. show us a link to their product’s pricing, and we’ll work with you to determine a fair price. return to top q: do you offer discounts to repair shops? a: yes. we offer 15% off and free shipping (on orders over $75) to all nesda members. we also give "frequent customer" discounts. we determine these discounts based on quantity of orders each quarter. for more information, please contact adam@shopjimmy.com. return to top q: how do i update my customer information?

a: yes. we use secure sockets layer (ssl) technology to ensure the privacy and security of your information. we're also a verified authorize.net merchant. we might be jokesters at times, but the security of your information is no joking matter. return to top q: what do you do with my payment information?

a: bloomington, mn. we try to incorporate our honest, midwestern values in every facet of our business. return to top q: what kind of inventory do you have? a: the majority of our inventory is tv replacement parts, but we do carry some monitor parts. you can search our entire inventory by keyword, such as "lcd" or "backlight inverter" or "sony". you can also search our entire inventory by part number (suggested). return to top q: where do you get your parts? a: the majority of our parts are reclaimed from new tvs damaged during freight shipping. return to top q: are your parts new or used? a: neither? our parts are "reclaimed" or "harvested." technically, we can't say they're "new" because they don't have an oem number and we didn't purchase them from the manufacturer. but, they're not "used" because we reclaimed them from new tvs damaged during shipping. return to top q: do you inspect your parts? a: from reclaiming to shipping, all of our parts go through a three-point inspection. our defective part return rate is around 3% (not too shabby for our industry) and dropping. return to top q: what's a shopjimmy rebuild part? a: our rebuild parts are refurbished and tested (depending on the defect) by our technicians in our warehouse. some of these parts may have ''cosmetic'' defects (broken connectors, small cracks, or burn marks), but these defects will not affect the performance of the part. our rebuild parts carry the same warranty as our new/unused parts. return to top q: do you sell replacement tv screens? a: due to the method we receive damaged tvs (almost all of them have broken screens), we do not sell replacement screens. return to top q: why should i purchase a part from you? a: we'll beat any distributor price (with a 90-day warranty) by 15%. we offer discounts to frequent buyers, repair shops, and nesda members. all of our orders ship same day if purchased by 3:15 cst (monday – friday). return to top q: what are your shipping and returns policies?
