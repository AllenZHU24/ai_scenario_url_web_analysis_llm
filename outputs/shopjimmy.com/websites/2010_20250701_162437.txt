help! how can i talk to someone? searching for a part q: how do i search for a part? a: we recommend searching by part number. partial searches do work. you can also find the brand of tv on our homepage and navigate to your specific part. return to top q: what information do i need to search for a part? a: here's an example for a sony search: for sony models, we typically list them as "kdl-xxxxxxx", allowing you to search as broadly or specifically as you want. if you type "kdl-40", you will see a list of parts for all 40" bravias. if you type "kdl-40s", you'll narrow your search to the s series of 40" bravias. if you type "kdl-40s2100" or "kdl-40s3000", you'll find the specific model. return to top q: what if the part i want is out of stock?

a: the majority of our parts are reclaimed from new tvs damaged during freight shipping. return to top q: are your parts new or used? a: neither? our parts are "reclaimed" or "harvested." technically, we can't say they're "new" because they don't have an oem number and we didn't purchase them from the manufacturer. but, they're not "used" because we reclaimed them from new tvs damaged during shipping. return to top q: do you inspect your parts?
