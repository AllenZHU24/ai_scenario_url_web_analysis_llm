(877) 881-6492 home about us about us a quick history lesson jimmy vosika, founder and director of partology, started buying and selling reclaimed tvs on ebay in 2007. he's a pretty smart guy (don't tell him we actually admitted that) and soon discovered that harvesting the undamaged tv parts inside these tvs is a better business model and more eco-friendly. and just like that, shopjimmy was born. pretty soon after shopjimmy's launch, jimmy migrated the business to its own website, shopjimmy.com (yep, you're in the right place). five buildings, 17 years, and hundreds of thousands of parts later, we now offer tv parts and components, tech tools, appliance parts, vacuum parts, computer parts, and more to over half a million customers across the globe. throughout this journey, we've tried our darnedest to maintain our midwestern roots and values. we're still based just south of minneapolis, mn, and we're a group of folks who like to root for the vikings (there are also a few "cheeseheads" among us) and complain about the cold. thank you for your support and allowing us to make repair easier! we're tv part smart you could say we're mildly obsessed with replacement parts and helping folks repair things in their home. we demand quality. we seek compatibilities. we want to make repair easier. we also acquire our parts from a variety of sources and channels, which allow us to offer the most comprehensive inventory in the industry. harvesting: we recover all of the working parts from new tvs damaged during manufacturer-to-retailer shipping (2,000+ per week), breaking down every tv in-house and inspecting every part three times. we also harvest appliance parts from different sources and via units with different condition grades. each of our appliance parts also gets inspected multiple times. sourcing: we also source parts and components directly from manufacturers to meet the fluctuating repair demands for certain models. partnerships: we developed innovative partnerships to both expand our inventory offerings and manufacture our very own products. awards newsweek's "america's fastest growing online shops": 2022 inc. magazine 500|5000 list: '11 (#224), '12 (#721), '13 (#938), '14 (#1,583), '15 (#3,447) forbes' "america's most promising companies": 2011 (#64) minneapolis/st. paul business journal's "100 best companies to work for": 2012 minneapolis/st. paul business journal's "fast 50": 2012 (#11), 2014 (#10) star tribune's "top work places": 2012 reverse logistics association's "best reverse logistics vendor solution": 2011 nesda's "partner in excellence" award: 2009-2012, 2015-2016 bsi: iso 9001 & 14001 certified a mission to make you happy our goal is to make you completely happy. this mission impacts every aspect of our business, especially our customer service. we have an experienced group customer service reps who know their parts, actually enjoy small talk, and want to ensure that you have the best possible experience with us. chat with us online. send us an email. hire a singing telegram or use a carrier pigeon. we are here to help you have a successful repair journey! × ok information about us contact us shipping & returns faqs customer reviews finding your tv part number tv repair video tutorials tv tech support tv repair shops directory become a supplier sj rewards program sj careers privacy policy categories tv parts appliance parts arcade game parts auto parts exercise equipment parts scratch & dent appliances tech tools shop by brand contact sales@shopjimmy.com2300 west highway 13burnsville, mn 55337 get 10% off your first order! subscribe to our newsletter. save on your order (and get future deals). say no to spam. © 2025 shopjimmy
