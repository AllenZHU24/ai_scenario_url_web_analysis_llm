glad you asked! we're a replacement parts supplier located in majestic, mild (we wish!) burnsville, mn. we have a growing inventory of over 600,000 tv parts, appliance parts, arcade parts, auto parts, tech tools and much more. most importantly, we pride ourselves as having the lowest prices online, as well as, the best customer service in the industry! where are you located? burnsville, mn (just south of minneapolis). we try to incorporate our honest, midwestern values in every facet of our business. what kind of inventory do you have? the majority of our inventory is tv replacement parts, but we also large and small appliance parts, arcade parts, auto parts and more. you can search our entire inventory by product type or keyword, such as "lcd" or "backlight inverter" or "sony.” if you're looking for a replacement tv part, we suggest starting your search by its part number. where do you get your parts? it depends! some of our tv parts are reclaimed from tvs damaged during freight shipping, but we also source and manufacture certain parts to meet demand. we also manufacture appliance parts and harvest them from new, refurbished, and used units. do you inspect your parts? from reclaiming to shipping, all of our parts go through a three-point inspection. our defective part return rate is around 3% (not too shabby for our industry) and dropping. do you sell replacement tv screens or panels? sorry! we don't carry any replacement tv panels or screens. replacement tv panels and screens are usually quite expensive for customers and tough to stock for us. however, if you'd like to continue searching for a panel, the two most important pieces of information to have are your tv model number (found on the back of your tv) and your tv panel number (found on the inside of your tv on the back of the panel). unfortunately, you should expect to spend about 80% of the cost of your tv on a replacement panel. we hope this information is helpful! × ok information about us contact us shipping & returns faqs customer reviews finding your tv part number tv repair video tutorials tv tech support tv repair shops directory sj rewards program sj careers privacy policy categories tv parts appliance parts arcade game parts auto parts exercise equipment parts scratch & dent appliances tech tools shop by brand contact sales@shopjimmy.com2300 west highway 13burnsville, mn 55337 get 10% off your first order! subscribe to our newsletter. save on your order (and get future deals). say no to spam. © 2024 shopjimmy
