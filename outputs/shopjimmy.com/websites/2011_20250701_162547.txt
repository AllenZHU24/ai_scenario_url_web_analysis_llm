(heh. see what i did there?) another thing we can all agree on is this: cancer is bad. very, very bad. even worse than crossing the streams. and while i was perusing some old scientific american articles, i happened across something really surprising. now, while we’ve noted that improperly disposed tv parts can cause cancer, did you know that some tv parts can fight cancer? it’s true! the way dlp tech works is it uses an optical semi-conductor called a digital micro-mirror device (dmd) to digitally modulate light. it does this via thousands of micro-mirrors to project an image, displaying 1024 shades of gray and — in some of the more high end sets — 35 trillion colors. yep, with a “t”. that looks like this: 35,000,000,000,000. based on the above capabilities of dlp chips, which are one of our most popular parts (we’re working on getting more, i assure you), doctors are now using them to help focus radiation blasts during treatments to keep the healthy tissue surrounding a cancerous tumor, well, healthy. they are also developing dlp-based imaging technology that would allow doctors to look at what are essentially holograms of our internal organs, including any tumors, and more accurately plan injection sites and surgeries. this is done by projecting two-dimensional cross-sections of individual organs at 5000(!) images a second. since our feeble brains can’t process images that fast, we see a fully three dimensional rendering that can be moved and viewed in 360 degrees. (most movies are shot at a measly 24 frames per second that we still don’t notice. are our brains lazy or something? c’mon!) the future is, well not exactly now, but like, super soon. comments are closed. subscribe to rss feed : categories about us chalk talk contests eliminating e-waste featured partologist funny hdtv news instructions media buzz really cool shopjimmy jr. sj news sj sales sj stat of the day sj stores program sjtv uncategorized website update about shopjimmy founded in 2007, shopjimmy is the global leader in tv parts distribution. with a growing inventory of over 275,000 tv parts, shopjimmy remains focused on delivering the highest quality, lowest-priced tv parts across the globe, reducing e-waste, and continuing its mission to make you happy. shipping policy | returns policy | privacy statement 952-881-6492 | 877-881-6492 | sales@shopjimmy.com © 2012 shopjimmy.com, llc. all rights reserved.
