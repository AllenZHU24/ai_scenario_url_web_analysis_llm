we recommend searching by part number. partial searches do work. you can also find the brand of tv on our homepage and navigate to your specific part. • 	what information do i need to search for a part? here's an example for a sony search: 1. for sony models, we typically list them as "kdl-xxxxxxx", allowing you to search as broadly or specifically as you want. 2. if you type "kdl-40", you will see a list of parts for all 40" bravias. 3. if you type "kdl-40s", you'll narrow your search to the s series of 40" bravias. 4. if you type "kdl-40s2100" or "kdl-40s3000", you'll find the specific model. • 	what if the part i want is out of stock? if you go to that part's product page, you'll see a "sign up to be notified" green button. once you login to your shopjimmy account (if you're not already logged-in), it will set a "product alert" for you (you can manage these in your "account dashboard") and email you when the part is back in-stock! • do you offer tech support? yes! please email sales@shopjimmy.com and we'll direct your email to our experienced and helpful techs. also, you can call us or livechat anytime monday – friday 8 am to 3:30 pm cst and saturday - sunday 10 am to 4 pm cst. • what if i'm not sure which part i need? send us an email (sales@shopjimmy.com) and we'll have one of our awesome tv repair technicians help you out! otherwise, you can call us or livechat (monday – friday 8 am to 3:30 pm cst and saturday - sunday 10 am to 4 pm cst) and we'll direct you to our tech support department. common questions • do you have a catalog? no. we don't have a catalog. since our inventory changes rapidly, it's easier for us to stay up-to-date if we display our inventory online. and we like saving trees. • do i need a customer account to make a purchase? nope! you can checkout as a guest. if you do plan on ordering tv parts from us more than once, however, we suggest that you create an account! all of your information is secure and safe. we'll never give your contact information to third parties. for added security, we do not keep your financial information on file. • how do i set-up a customer account? click my account at the top right of any page to set-up your account. you can also call us, and one of our friendly customer service representatives will help you set-up your account. all of your information is secure and safe. we'll never give your contact information to third parties. for added security, we do not keep your financial information on file. • do you price match other replacement parts distributors? yes. we will beat any in-stock, distributor price (with a 90-day warranty) by 15%. if you see a lower price online, call or email us. show us the link to our competitor’s page with their pricing, and if they have a 90-day warranty and the part is in-stock, we’ll beat that price by 15%! any other customer/group discounts will not be added/applied to price beat quotes. while we offer customer discounts to frequent buyers, we don't match competitors' customer discounts. we will match, however, active coupon codes from competing distributors! • do you price match ebay sellers? yes and no. we review these on a case-by-case basis. show us a link to their product’s pricing, and we’ll work with you to determine a fair price. • do you offer discounts to repair shops? yes. we offer 15% off to all nesda members. we also give "frequent customer" discounts. we determine these discounts based on quantity of orders each quarter. for more information, please contact adam@shopjimmy.com. • how do i update my customer information? click my account at the top right of any page to login to your account. from there, you will find 'my dashboard', where you'll be able to edit all of your customer information. • what if i forgot my password? please call or email us and we'll help you reset your password. payment • what forms of payment do you accept? we accept american express, visa, mastercard, discover, and credit card "gift certificates." we also accept checks or money orders: we'll ship your purchase as soon as we receive them. • is it safe to use my credit card or debit card on your site? yes. we use secure sockets layer (ssl) technology to ensure the privacy and security of your information. we're also a verified authorize.net merchant. we might be jokesters at times, but the security of your information is no joking matter. • what do you do with my payment information? we value the security of your payment information, so we never keep it on file. we secure and adjust payment information every transaction. for billing and management, you will be able to view the type of credit card used and the last four digits of the card. • do you have any core charges? no. we don't have any core charges. we're hardcore like that. about us • 	who the heck are you? glad you asked! we're a tv replacement parts supplier located in majestic, mild (we wish!) bloomington, mn. we have a growing inventory of over 375,000 tv parts. our specialty, besides rooting for the twins and vikings, are tv boards and dlp lamps/chips. we also sell refurbished tvs, universal tv stands, tv remotes, and various other electronics accessories. most importantly, we pride ourselves as having the lowest prices online, as well as, the best customer service in the industry! • 	where are you located? bloomington, mn. we try to incorporate our honest, midwestern values in every facet of our business. • 	what kind of inventory do you have? the majority of our inventory is tv replacement parts, but we also carry refurbished tvs, universal tv stands, tv remotes, and various other electronics accessories. you can search our entire inventory by product type or keyword, such as "lcd" or "backlight inverter" or "sony". if you're looking for a replacement tv part, we suggest starting your search by its part number. • 	where do you get your parts? the majority of our parts are reclaimed from new tvs damaged during freight shipping. we also source and manufacture certain tv parts to meet demand. • 	are your parts new or used? neither? our parts are "reclaimed" or "harvested." technically, we can't say they're "new" because they don't have an oem number and we didn't purchase them from the manufacturer. but, they're not "used" because we reclaimed them from new tvs damaged during shipping. we do, however, source various "new" tv parts direct from manufacturers. • 	do you inspect your parts? from reclaiming to shipping, all of our parts go through a three-point inspection. our defective part return rate is around 3% (not too shabby for our industry) and dropping. • 	what's a shopjimmy rebuild part? our rebuild parts are refurbished and tested (depending on the defect) by our technicians in our warehouse. some of these parts may have ''cosmetic'' defects (broken connectors, small cracks, or burn marks), but these defects will not affect the performance of the part. our rebuild parts carry the same warranty as our new/unused parts. • 	do you sell replacement tv screens? we do offer a limited selection of panels. • 	why should i purchase a part from you? we'll beat any distributor price (with a 90-day warranty) by 15%. we offer discounts to frequent buyers, repair shops, and nesda members. all of our circuit board orders ship free 2-day, and every order (regardless of product) ships same day if purchased by 3:15 cst (monday – friday). • 	what are your shipping and returns policies? at the top of this page, you'll see a shipping and returns questions link. this will take you to a comprehensive outline of our policies. you can also find links to these policies at the bottom right corner of every page. • 	how are you giving back to the community? we donate all proceeds from remote control sales to the children's hospitals and clinics of minnesota. we also like to volunteer from time to time. • what are you doing to better the environment? check out our "about us" page. we have a pretty cool e-waste ticker that shows how many pounds of electronics waste we've recycled since 2007! help! • 	help! how can i talk to someone?
