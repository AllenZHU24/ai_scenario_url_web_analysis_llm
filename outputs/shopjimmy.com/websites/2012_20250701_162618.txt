we ship every circuit board, lamp, and bulb order in the us free 2-day! our universal tv stands ship free ground, so plan for those to arrive on your doorstep in four business days or less. our refurbished tvs and replacement panels also ship ground (we'd love to ship these free ground, too, but it'd probably put us out of business!). • 	can i expedite my shipping? we will ship ups air (3-day, 2nd day air, and next-day air -- all options expedited in business days). prices vary based on delivery zip code, weight, box size, and declared value. • 	do you ship to apo or po boxes?
