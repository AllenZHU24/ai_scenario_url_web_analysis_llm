just put your payment info in and pick how much u want the gift card for and u r done! great idea!5 out of 5 stars reviewed by jennifer, december 23, 2008what a terrific idea to send the unloaded gift cards in each order! i had not planned to give a christianbook gift card, but when i saw unloaded card in my box i immediately thought of someone to give it to. it was so easy to load an amount on it, too. great idea cbd! i only wish you had sent a few more!5 out of 5 stars reviewed by meg, november 19, 2008the unloaded gift cards they included in my last package are great! it's easy to just get online and activate one when i need a last-minute gift. it's a nice thing to get a new believer so they can pick out books or a study bible to help them grow.i've also used the email gift certificate delivery. the email they sent wasn't the best looking... but it arrived about 5 minutes after i ordered it!1 out of 5 stars reviewed by katie, june 22, 2007i didn't recieve the gift certificate until exactly to the day, one month after purchase. the money came out of my account the day i placed the order, but i didn't recieve it until one month later. never again.i called 4x and got a different answer every single time as to whether it was sent at all.5 out of 5 stars reviewed by jeanette hildebrand, march 08, 2007outstanding way to provide a gift. i have some of the giftcards here at home. when i need a gift, i can load the amount i want and quickly have a gift and not pay for it until i need it.and i know that they can get just what they like too.thanks.5 out of 5 stars reviewed by sherri, december 15, 2006i love to give this gift to new and old christians to give them a huge resource for all their needs.5 out of 5 stars reviewed by rachel, august 29, 2006i do a reading reward program with my kids where i assign them a number of books to read me in a month and i then give them a reward after they have completed their goal. this is the perfect reward for them!
