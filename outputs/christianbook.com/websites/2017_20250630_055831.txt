likes you? it's just one of the soul-searching questions posed by bestselling author brennan manning who confesses he has been 'john the beloved, peter the coward, and thomas the doubter all before the waitress brought the check.' the niv ragamuffin bible offers a collection of manning's raw, painfully honest, yet grace-filled devotions, meditations, and reflections of his journey limping back

you, he delights in you.featurescomplete text of the world's most popular modern-english bible, the niv104 devotions guide you into a deeper connection to god and his word250 reflections help you

and ministry helping others experience the unconditional love of jesus christ. a recovering alcoholic and former franciscan priest, his own spiritual journey took him down a variety of paths, all of

manning is best known as the author of the contemporary classics, the ragamuffin gospel, abba's child, ruthless trust, the importance of being foolish, patched together, and the furious longing of
