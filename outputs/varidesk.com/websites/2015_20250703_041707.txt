check out our reviews!is varidesk easy to set up?oh, yeah! that’s actually one of the stand-out features we’re so proud of. varidesk was designed to be as simple as possible to set up. all models ship fully assembled and ready-to-use right out of the box. we do recommend that you have someone help you lift it onto the desktop. once it’s on your desk, just place your equipment on top and you’re ready to work.how much weight can my varidesk hold?for the pro 30, pro 36, pro plus 30, pro plus 36, cube plus 48, cube corner 48 and laptop 30 models, the recommended weight limit is 35lbs or 15.8kg. for the pro 48, and the pro plus 48, the weight limit is 45lbs or 20.4kg. for the pro desk 54, the weight limit is 50lbs or 22.2kg.does the varidesk work for people who are taller than 6’2” or shorter than 5’3”?sure, we have customers of all sizes who use varidesk daily. some of our taller customers like to use adjustable monitors that can be raised, and our customers under 5’3”, tell us that lowering your monitor height, or adding a wrist guard to the keyboard deck can help make it even easier to use.will it be hard to raise my varidesk with all my equipment on top?nope, just don’t exceed the weight capacity of your model. every varidesk is super easy to move up and down and stays steady and stable even at its maximum height. they all feature a spring-assisted mechanism that manages the weight so you can easily lift and lower it in just a few seconds. what’s the minimum measurement that will fit a varidesk?most standard desks have plenty of room for a varidesk because they come in several sizes to work with almost any workspace. for the varidesk pro 30 and pro plus 30 models, you only need 30” of width. for the pro 36 and pro plus 36 models, your desk will need to be 36” wide, and for the 48-inch size, your desk needs to be at least 4 feet wide. for the cube series and the laptop series, your desktop only needs to be 24” deep. for the pro series and pro plus series, your desktop needs to be at least 26", but if there’s something behind the desk (like a cubicle wall) 30” deep is better.do i have to fasten or permanently install the varidesk pro series, pro plus series, cube series or compact series onto my desk?no, that’s the beauty of it! you simply place varidesk on top of your existing desk with no need for tools or hardware of any kind. it’s cleverly designed to handle the weight of your equipment while staying safe and sturdy at any height. you can move your varidesk any time you want without causing scratches or damages.can my varidesk handle more than one monitor?absolutely, as long as you choose the right size. the pro 36 and pro plus 36 models, as well as the cube corner 48 are specifically designed to fit two monitors, and the pro 48, pro plus 48 and cube plus 48 models are designed for multiple-monitor set-ups. the pro 30, pro plus 30 and laptop 30 can only accommodate single-monitor setups.where can i get the varidesk app?the free app is located on our download page. just follow the instructions for your operating system.what's the best way to clean my varidesk? it’s easy, just use a warm damp cloth to clean the surface of your varidesk, and make sure it’s dry before replacing any electronic equipment.is the varidesk plus keyboard deck adjustable?the keyboard deck is fixed 4” below the display surface, so it’s not adjustable, but it does move up and down along with the display surface as you lift and lower your varidesk. if i don’t want to use the keyboard tray on my varidesk pro series model, how can i remove it?well, if you remove the keyboard tray, it alters the weight-balance of your varidesk and may make it unstable, so we really can’t recommend it. removing the keyboard tray will also void your warranty. but, if you insist, you can follow the keyboard tray removal steps in this video.how do we setup a tax exempt account?to place a tax-free order, first create an account online at varidesk.com using your email address. then, contact us through our contact us form. we’ll contact you once we’ve got all your info and give you the go-ahead to place your tax-free order!do you offer discounts on shipping?we can only offer shipping discounts for orders of 10 or more desks. shipping via freight is sometimes the most affordable option, but your facility has to have the following: a loading dock, the ability to accept a pallet, and staff available to unload the varidesks. please contact us if you have any questions.do you offer product discounts?varidesk offers a 5% discount on orders of 100 desks or more. get in touch with us at sales@varidesk.com to find out more. do you work with resellers?nope. varidesk doesn’t work with resellers or distributors. we proudly sell direct to our customers online with no middle man and no hassle. the pricing on our website is the same for all varidesk buyers. shop for your very own varidesk here. varidesk patents and trademarksshipping policy | terms and conditionscall (800) 207-2587 or contact us here
