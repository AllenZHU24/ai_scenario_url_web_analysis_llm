it’ll quiz you on your particular setup and needs and will provide you with our best solution for your scenario. what are the numbers in product names?the numbers in the product names mostly refer to their size. for example, the proplus™ 36 is 36 inches wide. the prodesk® 60 is 60 inches wide. in the case of the dual monitor arm 180°, the numbers in the name refer to the 180-degree rotation of the arms. the markerboard 40x72 is 40 inches wide and 72 inches tall. how many monitors will this desk hold?whether you’re working with a laptop or three monitors, we have a solution for you. visit the buyer’s guide for a handy chart, or use the quick fit finder. consider monitor arms to reach the max number of monitors for your desk. for more in-depth information, visit the full faq. what size monitors fit on the monitor arms?all our monitor arms are vesa standard compatible, featuring a backplate with distinct mounting holes at 75mm x 75mm and 100mm x 100mm. this fits a vast majority of monitors. the monitor arm and laptop cradle has a cradle that holds laptops measuring 15” diagonally and smaller. what desks work well for taller users?we typically classify people who are 6’ 1” or taller as a “taller” user. these taller users may find that the exec 40™ is a great fit for a desktop converter. for a full desk replacement, the prodesk® electric has the greatest range of heights, from 25.5” to 50.5” off the floor. for more information about all heights, see the full faq. how do i find product dimensions?our products’ dimensions can be found on the product page and in the tech specs. please note that it’s important that the feet/base of all desktop converters are supported by the desk. with our patented rowing lift, most desktop converters and the prodesk® 48 and 60 will raise up and towards the user, increasing the footprint of the desk. if you’re in a tight space, consider a space-saving solution like our laptop 30™, prodesk® 36, prodesk® 48 and 60 electric, or our proplus™ electric 32, all of which raise straight up. also consider if your space has overhead cabinets or shelves that might interfere with a raised desktop converter. call our customer experience team at (800) 207-2587 with questions. i have questions about assembly.we work hard to keep assembly as simple (or non-existent!) as possible. we suggest you keep your original packaging for the entirety of the 30-day return window for a seamless return process, should you need it. for more information, visit the full faq. all assembly instructions are available in the box and by calling customer experience at (800) 207-2587. our processesback to top how do i contact varidesk?by phone we want to hear from you!
