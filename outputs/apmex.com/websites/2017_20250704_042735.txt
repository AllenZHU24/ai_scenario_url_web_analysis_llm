as quickly as silver and gold spot prices. it is always good for any coin collector to know the approximate value of their coin. while the coin values list below is only a microcosm of all the coins available to collect, these can provide a better idea of the value of your coin. understand my coin's value all values listed within these categories are based on the 2018 red book of coin values. there are many grades and conditions available on these coins that add value. apmex does sell a wide variety of collectible coins online, perfect for both beginning and advanced coin collectors. values from the latest edition of the red book do not reflect the apmex buy or sale price of the coin. precious metal investors refer to the red book or "one-volume library" to learn the value of their coins and how much they are worth. here, you can see and truly understand the value of your silver dimes, nickels, cents, pennies, and more. silver coin values and gold coin values will differ, but it is a good idea to know the value of the coins you may possess. click one of the links below to start learning more about the value of your collectible coins online! coin value conditions coin values are based on a number of factors, such as rarity, condition, and the content of the precious metals within. because of these factors, just because one series of coins had a more limited mintage than another does not mean the value of the coins issued will always be greater. barber dimes are popular with many collectors but are considered more valuable when sold as a set representing several chronological years from the same mint. by contrast, bust dimes from different years, mint locations, and condition have highly variable monetary worth, individually or as a set. roosevelt dimes have coin values mostly determined by condition, but because they are readily available on the market, they are still affordable to collectors on any budget. even when a roosevelt dime has been graded as excellent condition, the asking price will still be affordable to many. saint-gaudens gold coins have been a favorite among collectors over the years, and their popularity continues to this day. demand remains strong throughout the world, and the asking price of any gold saint-gaudens is strongly influenced by this fact. equally popular among numismatic collectors are any u.s. coins with the seated liberty design. the coin values for seated liberty dollars, half dollars and quarters are based on a number of well-known minor details that can be found on the otherwise identical artwork used. within the united states, lincoln wheat pennies are sought-after by many collectors, giving them considerable value in spite of the fact that they carry no precious metals content. the 1909 lincoln wheat penny minted in san francisco sells for especially high amounts, due to very limited mintage, and historical significance. barber dime values learn more bust half dime values learn more
