details silver $29.77 usd - ($0.77) usd -2.47% view details platinum $945.00 usd - ($5.60) usd -0.6% view details palladium $954.50 usd - ($16.70) usd -1.81% view details spot price charts precious metal chart timeframes it is important to notate the timeframe of the price charts you are viewing to notice any trends or movements in the market before investing. the most common price chart timeframes are 24 hours, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years and 10 years. all the price chart timeframes, when viewed as a whole, provide a picture of the bigger market movements for an investor before making future purchasing decisions. if you are primarily looking at the prices based only on the 7-day chart, the price movements are based on short-term variations, which is beneficial but not always indicative of the longer-term market movements. when analyzing precious metals price charts, it is recommended to consult both the short-term and long-term charts to see the bigger, overall price trends for that timeframe. short-term vs dollar cost averaging although most investors base their purchasing decisions on both the short-term and long-term charts, there are still some investors who primarily use the shorter-term price charts. these investors analyze the shorter-term gold price charts and silver price charts to guess which way the gold and silver prices may move in the next few days to make their investment decisions. experts do not recommend this shorter-term process because it is difficult to accurately predict the market and its high-frequency trading can cause bigger losses on the investor's part. a longer-term investing plan, often referred to as dollar-cost averaging, is when an investor makes consistent investments at regular intervals over a longer period of time. as previously mentioned, it is extremely difficult to predict gold and silver market movements so consulting both short-term and long-term precious metals price charts as well as making consistent investments is the best way to guarantee you average fair pricing. dollar-cost averaging is the most efficient and effective way to protect your gold and silver investments over time.whichever investment strategy you choose, paying mindful attention to prices like the live silver spot price will equip you with the knowledge to make informed investments. shop by category
