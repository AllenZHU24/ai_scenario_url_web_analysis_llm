securely sealed shut. then, with what must be the strongest glue on earth, the bag itself is glued to the inside of the package so it doesn't thrash and crash around inside the package. the packaging is totally discrete, and it always arrives on time or even quicker. i don't worry when it comes to ordering from apmex. mike | december, 2014 i have ordered over six times through apmex. always delivered on time, this website and the people behind it can be trusted. richard | december, 2014 just wanted to call and let you know how much i appreciate all your help. i got my refund and decided to go to [a competitor] not for any other reason than they were a little cheaper. i was sooo disappointed with how i was treated, there was no customer service. wish now i'd never ordered from them. anthony | december, 2014 i just want to say that i have dealt with very few companies that pack and ship as well as your company does…….thank you very much and keep up the great service. matt | december, 2014 i recently purchased a few items for my ira, my ira rep was very professional and made the transaction painless. she is very much an asset to your company. great employees make great companies. don | december, 2014 thank you. thank you. thank you so much. everything is great thanks to your efforts…... edwin | december, 2014 thank you for excellent service. i will use apmex for future sales and purchases… bill | december, 2014 merry christmas and thank you for making doing business with you pleasureable!! mike | december, 2014 thank you very much for your help, super efficient and prompt…. garrett | december, 2014 top notch product and variety. you guys to me are the very best in the industry. have more sales! kevin | december, 2014 just wanted to let you kow i have received my order and i'm 100% satisfied! clinton | december, 2014 i just want to praise you on your packaging of the coins i recently bought…..i ordered other american eagles silver dollars and they were not individually separated and wrapped like your company does them. i will definitely be a returning customer. sal | december, 2014 for three months, i've been looking to begin investing in basic precious metals as an inflation hedge. i've spent considerable time comparing the most visible online brokers, including other well-respected, long-established businesses. apmex won. yelp review | december, 2014 thank you for outstanding service during these past 3-4 years. you have made it possible for me to deliver product at low fees, in a timely manner and be a trusted source. ron | december, 2014 yes, in my opinion this is the best company i have tried so far. illiana | december, 2014 little details of a christmas box and adding padding impressed me for my first purchase from apmex. speedy processing and delivery before thanksgiving was great. will definitely look to apmex for further purchases. emily | december, 2014 first time i ordered from apmex and was very satisfied with the service. diane | december, 2014 my experience with apmex was my first in purchasing precious metals and we will be doing this again soon. thank you. gary | december, 2014 you made it easy for a first time buyer, second order processed even faster. reed | december, 2014 you really outdid yourself this time. the selection you sent as a replacement was outstanding and the speed with which you sent it back was awesome. can't tell you how very much i appreciate your attention to service and the speed with whicfh you processed my return. i have rarely had to use your return policy but when i need to i love the way you handle it. thanks so much. martha | december, 2014 page: 1234...3839> your guide to investing in gold and silver we are committed to helping you better understand precious metals so you can be better-informed. get started learn more learn more learn more about apmex why apmex apmex reviews leadership team careers contact us buying & selling precious metals ira sell to us apmex club storage international faqs overall faqs shipping & handling return policy payment faqs policies privacy policy market loss policy user agreement connect with us 60k likes 1m views 0.2m views 17k followers 1k followers apmex blog 240 pins leading online precious metals retailer for over 10 years over 2.4 million ounces of gold sold | over 95 million ounces of silver sold stay informed of our special offers. sign up © 2015 apmex, inc. all rights reserved. back to top × module name × wishlist! × quantity notification 0 cart items in cart there are no items in the cart. auric
