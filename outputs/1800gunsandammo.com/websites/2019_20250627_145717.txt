a: 30 days. but we measure it not from the date of purchase, but from the date of delivery to you (as per delivery confirmation). q: what should i do if i missed the window, but i still want to return the product? a: you will need to contact manufacturer/brand directly to address your concern. we can provide contact information for the brand if you have difficulty locating it. q: i want to return the item and i am within the 30 day return/exchange window - what is my first step? a: contact us by email, phone or fax with the following information: your first and last name your contact email/phone your original order number reason for return subject line should read: ra (return authorization) request upon receipt of your request, we will review and process it. please allow 48-72 hours (depending on the time of the year) to process and issue a ra to you. you will need to write the ra number on the outside of the box you will be shipping the item back to us in. if you are including original packing list with the return, write the ra number on it as well. if we respond to you by email (99% of the cases), we will send you a ra form. this form must be included with your return. we reserve the right to reject and return to you at your cost any package that does not have a ra number on it. once you package your return into the box, include the ra form, and write the ra on the outside of the box - you can ship your return back to us. q: how long does it take 1800gunsandammo.com to process my return?

a: yes, once we process the return - we will notify you in regards to either a refund or exchange, depending on your situation and your request. q: what requirements do i need to adhere to in order for 1800gunsandammo to process returned goods and issue a refund? a: it's not complicated really! in fact it's very common sense. here's a list: all items must be new (as in the same condition as when they arrived to you). items cannot be returned if they have been used, worn, mounted, exposed to elements, tested, assembled into something bigger or disassembled for any reason. items have to be in the original manufacturer's packaging. items cannot be returned if the original packaging is missing, lost, damaged or destroyed. if item arrived inside a blister plastic pack, it can only be returned directly to manufacturer. items should have all of their original accessories, manuals, batteries, etc. when returned. if you received a free gift or a promotional item with purchase, it has to be returned in order for you to receive full refund. if the promo item/free gift is not returned with purchase, we will deduct retail value of the non returned item from your refund. all returned packages must have a ra on the outside of the shipping carton. q: does 1800gunsandammo charge restocking fees? a: as a rule of thumb, 1800gunsandammo does not charge restocking fees on items returned in compliance with our return policy. on any returns that are not compliant for any reason mentioned above, we reserve the right to charge up to 15% in restocking fees plus any applicable fees resulting from failure to return promotional items/free gifts. q: if i want to exchange what i bought for another item - what is the process? a: exchanges are easy. you simply need to indicate that you want to exchange when you contact us for a ra. your ra will have the information about the item you want to exchange the return for. if there is a price difference, you will either be asked to provide payment details or we will issue refund for the balance after the shipment of the exchange takes place. q: i just want a refund - what should i do? a: at the time of your ra request, simply state that all you want is a refund. we will review your return upon receipt, and if it is in compliance with policy, we will issue 100% refund. q: the item arrived defective - what should i do? a: you have 2 options in this case. if you are within the 30 day window, you can return the item to us or to the the manufacturer for an exchange/refund. if you are outside the 30 day return window, you will need to return the item to the manufacturer for warranty evaluation. in our experience, speaking to the manufacturer about warranty defects results in faster product turn around times and often customers get upgraded to newer models. this is not guaranteed, but it has been the case many times in the past. q: i received an item different from what i ordered - now what? a: you will need to notify our customer service department and we will take care of it. we will provide you with a return label for the mis-shipped product and process an order for reshipment. reshipment will be sent when we receive the first item back. if you are not willing to wait for the reshipment to take place upon return of your product, you will be asked for payment to secure the reshipment. the refund will be made to your account upon receipt of the first item delivered to you by mistake. q: are there any exceptions to the return policy that i need to be aware of? a: at this time, 1800gunsandammo will not accept returns or exchanges for the following: firearms that have been transferred from the dealer to the end user. installed goods, such as scopes, rings, mounts, flashlights, etc. that have been mounted or assembled into a weapon platform. special order/custom order items - e.g., built to spec firearms, firearms with changed out sights, promotional items, etc. hazardous items (as identified on individual product pages). q: i placed a special/custom order over the phone and now i want to return it - what are my options? a: we handle these on a case by case basis and most times we will have to assess restocking fees which may exceed 15% of the value depending on the product. q: i ordered a large quantity of items and i do not need all of them and would like to return my leftovers - what is the process? a: if you bought large quantity of items at a regular price, you can return the remaining items as long as you follow the guidelines above. if you received a volume discount, you can return the items, but your original order will be recalculated to be based on the non-discounted prices and the credit will be based on this calculation. still have questions?
