we focus on just what matters‚Ñ¢. in every category, there are ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù ‚Äî the gold standards of quality that are in line with what matters to people today. for cotton, it‚Äôs organic; for chips, it‚Äôs non-gmo; for paper products it‚Äôs sustainability. we call this category-by-category approach our ‚Äújust what matters‚Äù philosophy. learn more about our standards or quality for each category.the ‚Äújust what matters‚Äù philosophy also means we prioritize offering products that match people's values, preferences, and at times, requirements ‚Äî whether it be organic, fair trade, gluten-free, or vegan food; tree-free paper, non-toxic cleaning supplies, or cruelty-free and clean personal care products free of over 400 questionable ingredients.it really comes down to this: for every product sold on brandless, you can be sure we‚Äôve scoured the world to research and meet the quality gold standards for that category.safety & integrityour products are made under the highest standards of safety, quality, and social ethics such as certified global food safety (gfsi) or good manufacturing practices (gmp).household cleanersbrandless products adhere to the strictest performance and nontoxic, safer-chemical standards set by the epa.home & officeour paper products are either made with bamboo and sugarcane fiber or are fsc certified ensuring sustainable forestry practices.food & beverageour vast food assortment is entirely non-gmo and over half is certified organic. all of our food is made without any artificial preservatives or flavors.health & beautywe‚Äôre against animal testing. in addition, we‚Äôve banned over 400 harmful ingredients like parabens, polypropylene, phthalates, and sulfates from our beauty products.feminine hygienebrandless feminine hygiene products are made from hypoallergenic certified organic cotton, free of chlorine, rayon, fragrance, or dyes.simple, fair prices.at brandless, you never have to bother checking prices, because it‚Äôs all $3. yup. really. $3. how? we cut out the middleman and ship direct, so you don't pay extra for the countless unnecessary steps between the supplier and a traditional retailer‚Äôs shelf.all of those middleman markups are what we call the brandtax‚Ñ¢, the hidden extra costs you typically pay for a retail brand. by cutting out brandtax‚Ñ¢, we‚Äôre able to offer amazing quality products at an incredible value.community informedat brandless, we put people first. and that means you. (and you and you and you too!) we‚Äôre creating a new kind of brand-customer relationship by being in direct, two-way communication with the people who buy our stuff and the people who make our stuff.we‚Äôre engaging a community of people who believe everyone deserves better and that better doesn‚Äôt have to cost more.relationships = two way communicationmost cpg companies don‚Äôt have any relationship with consumers. if you think about how products are distributed today, their customers are the stores, not the end consumer. at brandless, we‚Äôre in constant contact with our community, and this goes way beyond our customer service team. the whole brandless organization is built around customer feedback. our merchants, marketers, and compliance gurus all talk directly to our customers, every day. we meet them in person, on the phone, on social media, and through email.our community even writes notes (and we write back!). we pay attention to what people buy and listen closely to what matters to them, and use that feedback to plan our collection. just ask candice mcdonald (@candicemcd) ‚Äî she asked for organic beef jerky and we delivered (love ya candice!). or alexandria williams-dawkins (@alexandriawill) ‚Äî she let us know she‚Äôd love green supplements and voila! brandless greens & antioxidant blend was born.tangible acts of kindnesswe‚Äôre dedicated to providing value to the greatest number of people possible, by democratizing access to quality, and making lasting change in our communities. we designed brandless to be a company that gives back every. single. day.tangible acts of kindnesswe‚Äôre dedicated to providing value to the greatest number of people possible, by democratizing access to quality, and making lasting change in our communities. we designed brandless to be a company that gives back every. single. day.helping to fight hunger with feeding america¬Ædid you know that 40 million people struggle with hunger in the united states?
