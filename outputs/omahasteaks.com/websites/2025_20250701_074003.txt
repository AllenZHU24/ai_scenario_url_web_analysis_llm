satisfied customer, but if there is a dispute that needs to be resolved, this section outlines what is expected of both of us. a. you agree to provide omahasteaks.com an opportunity informally to resolve your dispute. before you may pursue or participate in a dispute (or raise such dispute as a defense) in any court or arbitration against omahasteaks.com or its associates for any claims, including claims related in any way to omahasteaks.com products, these terms of use, billing, privacy, advertising, or omahasteaks.com's or its associates' communications with you, you must first send a written description of your claim to: omahasteaks.com, llc 11030 o street, omaha, ne 68137, attn: legal, and you must allow omahasteaks.com a reasonable opportunity to resolve your dispute. your written notice must describe the problem in reasonable detail, and identify or enclose all relevant documents and information. you and omahasteaks.com agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your claim. if you and omahasteaks.com do not reach a resolution of your dispute within sixty (60) days after omahasteaks.com receives your written notice of claim, you may pursue your claim in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in court. b. arbitration. you and omahasteaks.com agree to arbitrate all disputes between the parties, except as provided in this subsection (b). arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. this arbitration agreement covers any dispute arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the claim arises or may arise before or after the term. for purposes of this arbitration provision, references to "omahasteaks.com," "you," and "us" includes our associates. this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. notwithstanding the arbitration agreement set forth in the prior paragraph, if you fail to pay in full any amounts you owe when they are due, omahasteaks.com may assign your account for collection, and omahasteaks.com and/or the collection agency may pursue in court claims limited to the collection of past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or these terms. (however, omahasteaks.com disclaims any and all liability, and you relieve omahasteaks.com from any and all liability, with respect to the conduct of any such collection agency.) in addition, omahasteaks.com may seek injunctive relief in any court with respect to any violation of a patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, trade secret, and/or other intellectual property rights of omahasteaks.com or of any third party. you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if: (a) your claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over you and omahasteaks.com is proper, in which case you may initiate proceedings in small claims court; or (b) you opt out of these arbitration procedures within thirty (30) days from the date you first access or otherwise use this site or any information or materials contained on the site (the "opt-out deadline"). you may opt out by writing to us at either of the following addresses: omahasteaks.com, llc11030 "o" streetomaha, ne 68137attn: legal legal@omahasteaks.com either you or omahasteaks.com may start an arbitration proceeding by sending to the other, by certified mail, a letter requesting arbitration ("demand"). if you start the arbitration, you must send the demand to omahasteaks.com, attn.: general counsel, 11030 o street, omaha, ne 68137. the demand must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the relief sought. the american arbitration association's ("aaa") commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes (collectively, the "aaa rules"), as modified by these terms of use, will govern the arbitration. the aaa rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879. if your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the aaa rules. if your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a written opinion sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. upon you or omahasteaks.com filing an arbitration demand, omahasteaks.com will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your claim exceeds $75,000. if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the aaa rules will govern the payment of these fees. all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. unless omahasteaks.com and you agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in which your most recent billing address (as you provided to omahasteaks.com) is located. one arbitrator, who is selected under the aaa rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the food industry, will conduct the arbitration. if no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of you and omahasteaks.com. the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties. judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. this provision will be specifically enforceable in any court. the arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees). you or omahasteaks.com must bring any claim arising out of or related to these terms or our relationship within one (1) year after the claim arises, or the claim will be permanently barred. to the extent the law applicable under subsection (c) of these terms of use makes this limitations period unenforceable with respect to any claim(s), then the statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern these terms under subsection (c) shall apply. you and omahasteaks.com agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action. neither you nor omahasteaks.com shall be a member in a class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. if you timely opt out of the arbitration provision in the manner described above, then the waiver of the right to participate in a class action will not apply to you. omahasteaks.com does not consent to class arbitration; accordingly, if a court refuses to enforce this subsection (b), then the agreement to arbitrate shall be unenforceable as to you. whether a claim proceeds in court or in arbitration, you and omahasteaks.com hereby waive any right to a jury trial.. c. governing law. these terms, and any disputes arising between you and omahasteaks.com related in any way to these terms of use or omahasteaks.com's products, including but not limited to disputes over billing, service, privacy, advertising, or omahasteaks.com's or its associates' communications with you, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or common law, will be governed by the laws of the state in which your most recent billing address (as you provided to omahasteaks.com) is located, without regard to choice of law principles. steaklover rewards program terms and conditions the steaklover rewards program (the "program") is operated by bt gift certificates, llc (d/b/a omaha steaks) and offered by omaha steaks and affiliated companies. as a member, your participation in the steaklover rewards confirms your agreement to be bound by the terms described herein and all terms incorporated by reference. by completing the registration process for the program, you represent that you can and will be legally bound by this agreement. no member may participate if doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or regulation. please read these terms and conditions carefully;

8.1 this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of nebraska. subject to the dispute resolution mechanisms below, any disputes arising out of or relating to this

the procedures set forth below: a. you agree to provide omahasteaks.com an opportunity informally to resolve your dispute. before you may pursue or participate in a dispute (or raise such dispute as a defense) in any court or arbitration against omahasteaks.com or its associates for any claims, including claims related in any way to omahasteaks.com products, these terms of use, billing, privacy, advertising, or omahasteaks.com's or its associates' communications with you, you must first send a written description of your claim to: omahasteaks.com, llc 11030 o street, omaha, ne 68137, attn: legal, and you must allow omahasteaks.com a reasonable opportunity to resolve your dispute. your written notice must describe the problem in reasonable detail, and identify or enclose all relevant documents and information. you and omahasteaks.com agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your claim. if you and omahasteaks.com do not reach a resolution of your dispute within sixty (60) days after omahasteaks.com receives your written notice of claim, you may pursue your claim in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in court. b. arbitration. you and omahasteaks.com agree to arbitrate all disputes between the parties, except as provided in this subsection (b). arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. this arbitration agreement covers any dispute arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the claim arises or may arise before or after the term of this agreement. for purposes of this arbitration provision, references to "omahasteaks.com," includes our associates. this arbitration agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. notwithstanding the arbitration agreement set forth in the prior paragraph, if you fail to pay in full any amounts you owe when they are due, omahasteaks.com may assign your account for collection, and omahasteaks.com and/or the collection agency may pursue in court claims limited to the collection of past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this agreement. however, omahasteaks.com disclaims any and all liability, and you relieve omahasteaks.com from any and all liability, with respect to the conduct of any such collection agency. in addition, omahasteaks.com may seek injunctive relief in any court with respect to any violation of a patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, trade secret, and/or other intellectual property rights of omahasteaks.com or of any third party. you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if: (a) your claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over you and omahasteaks.com is proper, in which case you may initiate proceedings in small claims court; or (b) you opt out of these arbitration procedures within thirty (30) days from the date you first enroll in the subscription program (the "opt-out deadline"). you may opt out by writing to us at either of the following addresses: omaha steaks international, llc11030 "o" streetomaha, ne 68137attn: legal legal@omahasteaks.com either you or omahasteaks.com may start an arbitration proceeding by sending to the other, by certified mail, a letter requesting arbitration ("demand"). if you start the arbitration, you must send the demand to omaha steaks international, llc, attn: legal, 11030 o street, omaha, ne 68137. the demand must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the relief sought. the american arbitration association's ("aaa") commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes (collectively, the "aaa rules"), as modified by these terms of use, will govern the arbitration. the aaa rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879. if your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the aaa rules. if your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a written opinion sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. upon you or omahasteaks.com filing an arbitration demand, omahasteaks.com will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your claim exceeds $75,000. if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the aaa rules will govern the payment of these fees. all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. unless omahasteaks.com and you agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in which your most recent billing address (as you provided to omahasteaks.com) is located. one arbitrator, who is selected under the aaa rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the food industry, will conduct the arbitration. if no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of you and omahasteaks.com. the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties. judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. this provision will be specifically enforceable in any court. the arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees). you or omahasteaks.com must bring any claim arising out of or related to this agreement or our relationship within one (1) year after the claim arises, or the claim will be permanently barred. you and omahasteaks.com agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action. neither you nor omahasteaks.com shall be a member in a class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. if you timely opt out of the arbitration provision in the manner described above, then the waiver of the right to participate in a class action will not apply to you. omahasteaks.com does not consent to class arbitration; accordingly, if a court refuses to enforce this subsection (b), then the agreement to arbitrate shall be unenforceable as to you. whether a claim proceeds in court or in arbitration, you and omahasteaks.com hereby waive any right to a jury trial. entire agreement 9.1 this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and omahasteaks.com regarding the subscription program and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral. by subscribing to the subscription program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this agreement. last updated: january 08, 2025 sign in email address * show password * sign in forgot your email? forgot your password? sign in with google sign in
