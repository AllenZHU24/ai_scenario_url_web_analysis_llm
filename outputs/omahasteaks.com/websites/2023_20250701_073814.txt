unauthorized access and to maintain data security. these safeguards vary based upon the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. we update and test our technology on a regular basis in order to improve the protection of customer information. we require service providers to whom we provide personal information for marketing, servicing, or processing purposes to restrict the use of the personal information to those purposes and we prohibit independent or unauthorized use of such information. service providers are required to implement and maintain security procedures. they must promptly notify us of any data breach, supply information regarding the breach, and cooperate with us to resolve the breach and provide notification thereof, as required by law. you play a significant role in protecting your information. after registering on our site, you are responsible for protecting the security of your username and password. you are responsible for any transaction made using your username and password. although we will take reasonable security precautions regarding your personal information, because of the open nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that any of your

differ from ours. we encourage you to read that policy before responding to the offer. we are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated marketing partners to which our

retain data on sales transactions for an extended period of time in order to facilitate any claims or recalls. if you refuse to provide your data to facilitate a transaction, we reserve the right to refuse and reject any attempt by you to make a purchase. we also retain personal information for a reasonable period of time associated with the purpose for which we collected it in accordance with our data retention policies. our data retention policies are informed by business needs, accounting rules, and legal and regulatory requirements. children under 16 we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 16 without containing verifiable consent from their parents. we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our website, and so we carry

the personal information is sensitive or creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person such as financial information, social security numbers, and driver's license numbers. we will not provide specific pieces of personal information unless you expressly request them. right to deletion you have the right to request that we delete any personal information we have collected about you. please understand that we are not required to honor a deletion request if a legal exemption applies such as if we need the information to complete a requested or reasonably anticipated transaction, prevent security incidents or fraud, or comply with legal obligations. right to correct you have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you. after you request to correct inaccurate personal information, we will provide instructions explaining how to provide us with optional documentation to support your request. if you provide documentation, we will consider it. we may decline to correct your personal information if we determine based on the totality of the circumstances that your personal information on file is more likely than not accurate. we may also decline to correct your personal information if we determine that your request is fraudulent or abusive. if your request to correct your personal information is denied, you may request that we note in our records and notify any service providers and third parties to whom we disclosed your allegedly inaccurate personal information that its accuracy has been disputed. we may decide to delete your allegedly inaccurate personal information instead of correcting it. right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information you have the right to request that we do not sell or share your personal information to others. please note that opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information will not impact any sale or sharing of your personal information that may have occurred prior to the date of your opt-out request. we will recognize browser-based opt-out signals as required by law, specifically global privacy control. if we receive an opt-out signal and are able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of all personal information we have on file for the consumer and disable cookies and other tracking tools placed by third parties. if we receive an opt-out signal and are not able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out limited to the personal information we collect from the consumer during the online session during which the signal is present and to disable cookies and other tracking tools placed by third parties. right to appeal you have the right to appeal our decision to deny, in full or in part, your exercise of consumer rights by submitting a request to appeal. if we deny your appeal, we will provide you with a written explanation of the reasons for our decision. if you are not satisfied with our explanation for the denial of your appeal, you may contact your state attorney general to submit a complaint about the appeal results. non-discrimination notice we will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their privacy rights under law or this privacy policy. submitting a consumer rights request you may submit your request(s) by calling us toll-free at 1-800-228-9872 or submitting your request using our online form. after you submit your request, we may contact you to obtain additional information necessary to verify your identity. for example, we may require you to verify certain information in our files or submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury verifying your identity. we will not process right to know, deletion, or correction requests without verifying your identity, so please respond promptly. if you do not timely respond to our requests for information, we may deny your request. we will process verified right to know, right to correct, and right to deletion requests within 45 days of receipt, subject to any applicable exemptions and extensions permitted by law up to 90 days. if you request access to specific personal information and that information creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person, we will withhold that information and replace it with a category identifier. for example, if we withhold a social security number, we will inform you that we have a social security number on file. if you have an online account with us, we will provide the response to your request via the online account, otherwise, we will give you the option to choose between mail and electronic delivery. we will retain a copy of your request for at least two years as required by law. we will process requests to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information within 15 business days or receipt. authorized agent if you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of a consumer (other than a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information), you must provide a copy of a lawful power of attorney or a written signed authorization from the consumer along with proof of your identity. you may provide this documentation via email to custcare@omahasteaks.com after submitting the request. we may contact you and the consumer on whose behalf you claim to act to verify your identity, the consumer's identity, and your authorization to act on the consumer's behalf. california sensitive personal information disclosure we do not collect "sensitive personal information” as defined by the california consumer privacy act and, therefore, we do not process such sensitive personal information for any purpose including for purposes other than those specified in 11 cal. code of regs. § 7027(m). california "do not track" disclosure do not track is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting that a user's activity not be tracked. currently, our sites do not respond to "do not track" signals. california website ownership disclosure under california civil code section 1789.3, california residents are entitled to the following specific consumer rights information: the provider of the site is omaha steaks international, inc., 11030 o street, omaha, ne 68137. to file a complaint regarding the site or to receive further information regarding use of the site, send a letter to the above address or contact us via e-mail at custcare@omahasteaks.com. you may also contact the complaint assistance unit of the division of consumer services of the department of consumer affairs in writing at 1625 north market blvd., suite n 112, sacramento ca 95834 or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210. california notice of financial incentive and colorado loyalty program disclosure this section only applies to residents of california and colorado. we offer consumers two opportunities to receive rewards and benefits in connection with their disclosure of personal information to us or permission to collect personal information. first, if you sign-up to receive email or text message marketing, we may offer you one or more discounts. we receive and process identifiers and personal information as defined in cal. civ. code § 1798.80(e) in connection with this opportunity. second, you may sign-up for our steaklover rewards program ("slr") using our online sign-up process. as part of slr, we will collect and analyze identifiers, commercial information, characteristics of protected classification, professional or employment-related information, and personal information as defined in cal. civ. code § 1798.80(e) to draw inferences about you and better tailor our marketing to you and offer you discounts and other rewards that are not available to consumers who have not enrolled in slr. we also sell identifiers, commercial information, characteristics of protected classification, professional or employment-related information, inferences, and personal information as defined in cal. civ. code § 1798.80(e) to data brokers in connection with your participation in slr. your participation in either opportunity is subject to our terms of use, completely voluntary, and may be withdrawn at any time. under california law, the discounts and other rewards we provide may be considered financial incentives offered in return for your personal information. under colorado law, these programs may be considered loyalty programs. although some rewards will have a stated approximate value, others, such as a percentage off discount, may have a value based on your choices when redeeming them. we have made a good faith estimate of the aggregate value of the financial incentives offered to consumers as compared to the value we derive, directly or indirectly, from the personal information consumers provide when participating in the activities to which the financial incentives relate. our analysis takes into consideration the likely increase in sales to consumers who participate in either opportunity and compensation we receive from third parties to whom we sell personal information, if applicable. our analysis also considers offsets for our anticipated business expenses related to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information as well as our expenses related to the financial incentives offered and the operation of our business. based on our good faith estimate, we have determined that the aggregate value to participating consumers of the financial incentives we offer is reasonably related to the value we derive, directly or indirectly, from the personal information consumers collectively provide when participating the financial incentive opportunities. by choosing to participate in the activity and provide us with the personal information we request as part of the activity, you are choosing to opt into the financial incentive offered. you may withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by sending us a withdrawal request to custcare@omahasteaks.com or calling us at 1-800-228-9872. if you make a request to delete your personal information, your request will terminate your participation in our financial incentive programs because we must possess your personal information in order to communicate with you about the program and, if you participate in slr, to accurately track your purchases and customer relationship with us to allocate and fulfill rewards. if you make a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, and you are an slr participant, we will process your request in accordance with this privacy policy and it will not impact your ability to participate in slr. while we may sell or share personal information of consumers, including slr members, in accordance with the descriptions of our selling and sharing practices elsewhere in this privacy policy, we do not sell or share the personal information of slr members solely as a result of their participation in slr. your choice to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information will not impact your participation in the email/text marketing financial incentive opportunity. individuals located in the european economic area, switzerland, and united kingdom (collectively, "europe") we do not ship our products to individuals located in europe; however, customers located in europe may occasionally purchase products that will be shipped to consumers outside of europe. we collect personal information of the purchaser as needed to fulfill the order and maintain records related thereto. we will not use the personal information of individuals located in europe for any other purpose. how to contact us our mailing address: omaha steaks - customer
