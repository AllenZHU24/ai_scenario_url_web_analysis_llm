the pupil's lounge | grab some coffee and stay a while the pupil's loungegrab some coffee and stay a while frames for your face shape 11.09.2016 by kevin king // shopping online for glasses provides you with a ton of frame options, but sometimes itâ€™s difficult to find which styles look best on you. rather than taking a chance on a frame that you hope youâ€™ll enjoy, why not base your frame selection on your face shape? this will leave you feeling comfortable in your new glasses and happy with your decision to shop online. in addition to helping your vision, eyeglasses also help frame your entire face, which is a key component in your overall look. in order to discover which style looks best on you, one must first understand their face shape. out of these six face shapes, which one best describes you? do you have an oval face shape? if the answer is yes, then youâ€™re in the clear. the length of your face is one and a half times the width of your face, thus creating an enviable oval shape.â those with an oval face shape can pull off just about any frame style –â this includes frames forâ prescription sunglasses. whether youâ€™re interested in bigger wayfarer frames or even a bold cat eye look, youâ€™re most likely good to go! iconic faces: beyonce, jude law college people with square face shapes have hairlines that are approximately the same width as their jawlines.â if you were looking for flattering glasses on your square face, one good tip would be to search for a frame that is slightly rounded. a round frame will balance out your angular features with a fashionable and modern look. a square frame on a square face may not provide the proper balance youâ€™ll want to bring out your best features. iconic faces: ryan seacrest, olivia wilde ernest hemingway 4612 those with heart face shapes have faces that are their widest at the forehead and taper down into a narrower, sometimes sharp looking chin. rectangle or oval shaped frames will help complement a heart shaped face. frames with thicker bottom halves do an excellent job enhancing heart face shapes because they help balance out the narrower lower half of the face. iconic faces: reese witherspoon, masi oka trento though similar to oval face shapes, the long face shape gets its namesake from having more length but less width than a traditionally oval face. the best way to bring out long face shaped features is to shorten the length of the face. a pair of thick rectangle frames always works best to take attention away from the length of the face. when it comes to long faces, frames with depth over width are always the way to go. iconic faces: sarah jessica parker, adam levine fontana a diamond face shape is the widest at the cheekbones and is narrow across the hairline and jawline, thus creating an overall diamond-like shape. diamond face shapes are very rare and unique. the best way to accentuate a diamond face is show off your impressive cheekbones with a bold style. one way to draw attention to your eyes is with top-heavy frames. semi-rimless frames also look great on diamond shaped faces, and a thicker top half of the frame will draw the focus to the top portion of your face. iconic faces: scarlett johansson, ryan gosling depp round face shapes are a shorter version of oval faces. they are nearly as wide as they are long, and typically, those with round face shapes have rounded jawlines. styles that can minimize the roundness of your face are the best styles for this shape. therefore, avoid oval or round frames and look for frames with more of an angular design. straight lines on frames help soften the look of round faces. iconic faces: hayden panettiere, gerard butler helium although we do recommend flattering your look with a pair of glasses that best suits you, donâ€™t force yourself to choose a pair of glasses you truly donâ€™t enjoy or feel comfortable wearing. if you have a square face, but want to sport square frames, go for it! thereâ€™s no shame in rocking what you feel the most confident wearing on your face. glasses are a great way to express your style and personality in a way only you know is best. try our exactfitâ„˘ virtual try-on tool, print an exact size image of a frame on our website, and choose which one looks best. donâ€™t be afraid to ask for opinions from your peers, but at the end of the day, you should always select the frame that makes you comfortable, confident, and happy. categories // 39dollarglasses, celebrity spotting, eyeglass reviews, eyeglasses fashions, fashion eyewear, trends tags // affordable eyeglasses, affordable glasses, affordable sunglasses, cheap contact lenses, cheap contacts, cheap eyeglasses, cheap glasses, cheap sunglasses, contact lenses, contacts, discount eyeglasses, discount eyewear, discount glasses, discount sunglasses, eyeglasses, eyewear, face shapes, fashion, glasses, online glasses, online prescription eyeglasses, online prescription glasses, online prescription sunglasses, optical, prescription eyglasses, quality, rx prescription eyeglasses, rx prescription glasses, rx prescription sunglasses, style, sunglasses, visionprotect your eyes from blue light 10.26.2016 by kevin king // what is blue light and how can it be harmful to your eyes? sunlight contains colors that are on the visible light spectrum. these colors include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet (you may remember learning roygbv in school). you are exposed to this spectrum of colors throughout your daily life. electronic devices blue light may also come from man-made products such as fluorescent and led screens. smart phones, computers, and other electronic devices all emit harmful blue light, but it is only a fraction of what is emitted from the sun. however, the amount of time humans spend on their electronic devices has many eye care professionals worried about the harm that blue light can cause their eyes. additionally, blue light has a very short wavelength, and therefore produces a higher amount of energy. high-energy blue light travels a lot more easily than other visible light because it is not as focused. this decreases visual contrast and eventually leads to the straining of your eyes. this is why itâ€™s always best to look away from your screen every few minutes in order to give your eyes a break. the sun when it comes to harmful uv rays from the sun, the human eye is actually very effective at blocking these rays from reaching the retina, even without sunglasses. nevertheless, sunglasses are essential in protecting your eyes from these uv rays from reaching other parts of the eye that may cause damage and lead to serious diseases such as cataracts. therefore, those who spend an extensive amount of time on electronic devices are not protecting themselves. unlike uv rays from the sun, people are more unaware about the effects of blue light. increasing your risk exposure to blue light increases your risk of macular degeneration due to the damage of the light-sensitive cells. macular degeneration is the degeneration of the macula, which is the part of your retina responsible for the sharp, central vision needed to read or drive. it is the leading cause of vision loss and affects more than 10 million americans. this is more than cataracts and glaucoma combined. sleep disturbance the blue spectrum hits the cells in your eyes that send a signal to the brain to release melatonin. because of this, melatonin production is turned off. melatonin is a hormone your body produces which is key for falling asleep. your melatonin levels begin to rise a few hours before bedtime; therefore, the blue light from your phone or laptop can disrupt your circadian rhythm and keep you awake as well as cause sleep pattern disturbance. how do i stay safe?
