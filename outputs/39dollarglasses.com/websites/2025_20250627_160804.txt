glasses: picking your frame shape you can think of glasses frames in three broad categories: square, oval, and round. each category includes a few different styles, but those differences are more a matter of personal preference. when it comes to picking the best specs for your face, three broad categories are all we need.squarefirs… you can think of glasses frames in three broad categories: square, oval, and round. each category includes a few different styles, but those differences are more a matter of personal preference. when it comes to picking the best specs for your face, three broad categories are all we need.squarefirst up: classic square frames. this includes everything from perfectly rectangular designs to blocky glasses with slightly rounded corners. square frames are great at putting the focus on more masculine features, so they tend to be a good pick if you have a rounder face and want to emphasize your jawline and brow. if you have a more square-shaped face, you can still go with square frames — just take a closer look at options with slightly rounded corners. these frames will help balance the difference between your sharp and round features.ovalunlike square frames, oval frames have a rounding effect on most faces. if you have a narrow face, oval designs are a flattering option that can balance your features. for men with rounder facial structures, ovals will emphasize the round appearance. roundjust like oval frames, round frames can offer balance to narrow and square faces while emphasizing round ones. for men with square facial structures, choosing a pair of round frames with stronger browlines (like these davenport eyeglasses) can add structure to the face and put the focus on masculine features. if you’re looking for round specs that don’t emphasize masculine features, check out wire frame glasses like these. since wire frame glasses don’t have bold browlines, they’re a good way to get the round look without putting the focus on your cheekbones, browline, or jaw. read more frequently asked questions how wide are men's glasses? beyond frame shape, thinking about the width of your glasses is part of picking a good
