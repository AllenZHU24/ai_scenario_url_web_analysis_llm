our lenses are top quality, thin or ultra-light polycarbonate lens. we use polycarbonate lenses for a number of reasons. first and foremost, it is the required lens type for all children's eyewear because of its safety qualities. in fact, polycarbonate is the type of material used in making bulletproof glass. it's also the preferred lens for people who have a lazy eye, or amblyopia, or who are blind in one eye. this material protects the "good" eye in case of an injury or accident. secondly, polycarbonate lenses are the most impact-resistant and lightest material made for eyeglasses. they are much thinner than cr39 (standard) optical lenses, due to the 1.59 refraction index. at no extra charge, all lenses come with a scratch-resistant coating (on both sides of the lenses) and a 100% uv coating. as a finishing touch, all lens edges are polished. that said, we also carry a copious supply of other lenses for all of our eyewear frames. browse through our full prescription lenses list here. can i get anti-reflective coating? absolutely. anti-reflective coating enables people to see your eyes through their lenses, rather than a light reflection. anti-reflective coating works by improving the light transmission through the lenses, always giving you sharp, clear vision. anti-reflective lenses are highly recommended for night driving and computer use. in most establishments, premium anti-reflective coating retails for around $70, but at 39 dollar glasses.com, you can add it to any package for just $24.95. do you offer a 100% online quality guarantee? as a matter of fact we do. we provide an unconditional guarantee on all our frames and lenses that they will be free of defects, and manufactured and delivered exactly as ordered. before your order is shipped to you, a certified technician inspects each pair of eyeglasses or prescription sunglasses to ensure correct frame alignment and prescription accuracy. we package your glasses in a durable, attractive hard case so they are well-protected during shipping. see our full selection of prescription glasses here. about us · our blog · privacy policy by truste · affiliate program · customer rewards · about our frames · shipping options contact us · track my order · help · about your prescription · contact lenses · about your pd · product reviews · sitemap men's eyeglasses · women's eyeglasses · online eyeglasses · cheap eyeglasses · discount eyeglasses © copyright 2000 - 2011 39dollarglasses.com and its licensors. all rights reserved. home| my account| worry free guarantee| contact us 0 items in your cart| checkout shop eyeglasses men's eyeglasses women's eyeglasses metal eyeglasses plastic eyeglasses rimless eyeglasses semi-rimless eyeglasses kids eyeglasses reading glasses bendable titanium eyeglasses bifocals progressive lenses use your own frame shop sunglasses men's sunglasses women's sunglasses aviator sunglasses metal sunglasses plastic sunglasses rimless sunglasses semi-rimless sunglasses kids sunglasses bendable titanium sunglasses bifocal sunglasses progressive sunglasses use your own frame new arrivals eyeglasses sunglasses faq order tracking email password forgotten password?
