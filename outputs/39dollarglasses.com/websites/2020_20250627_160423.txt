"dist" (distance) is often abbreviated "d.v." 03. "near" (reading) is often abbreviated "n.v." 04. for reading-only glasses: some doctors will write the reading prescription separately, in its entirety (as "near" or "n.v." or "n.v.o."), as in sample rx #3. if this is the case, enter the power in the bottom half of the form (you'll see; it's easy), and leave the add power blank ("0.00"). if you do not understand any part of your prescription, please call us to ensure everything is entered correctly. don't be shy; we are here to help, and we want your glasses to be made exactly to your doctor's specifications. od = right eye os = left eye ou = both eyes sph cyl axis prism add o.d. -1.00 -0.25 005 +2.50 o.s. -1.75 +2.50 sph cyl axis prism add o.d. -100 - 25 x 5 + 250 o.s. -175 + 250 sph cyl axis prism dist o.d. -1.00 -0.25 005 o.s. -1.75 near o.d. +1.50 -0.25 005 o.s. +0.75 other helpful hints: 01. your doctor may use a blank rx pad, not a pre-made rx pad for eyeglasses only. if this is the case, you can draw imaginary grid-lines to separate the numbers. it will separate the different values more easily for you. the top power is always the right eye & the bottom power is always the left. 02. if you don't see numbers in some of the boxes (if there is no cyl or axis or add), leave those values blank when ordering. if you only see one number for each eye, it's the "sphere" power; leave all the other fields blank. 03. it is common for the doctor to sometimes leave out the decimal points. if you see a number like -25 or +175, it is understood that your doctor means -0.25 or +1.75, respectively. also, an axis of 5 (or 05) is the same as 005; 90 is the same as 090. it's like using abbreviations or writing in short-hand. 04. if you have no astigmatism in one or both eyes, your doctor may just write the sphere power alone, or may use placeholders like sph ("sphere") or d.s. ("diopters sphere") instead. 05. if you have a prescription for bifocals, and you only see one add power, it's understood that you have the same add for both eyes. if you don't see an add power, leave it blank. 06. some common prescription abbreviations: sph or sph = sphere power; the "overall" power d.s. or ds = diopters sphere (means you have sphere power only) cyl or cyl = cylinder power; the amount of astigmatism x = axis; x 90 means axis 090 add = how much power gets added to the distance rx, for your reading-only rx or for the bottom half of your bifocals/progressives pl or pl or plo = plano; it's a placeholder for the number zero o.d. or od = right eye o.s. or os = left eye o.u. or ou = both eyes nv or nvo = near-vision or near-vision-only; your doctor is recommending "reading-only" glasses p.d. or pd = pupillary distance (the distance in between your right pupil and your left pupil), in millimeters (mm) -50 = -0.50 +100 = +1.00 if you still do not understand any part of your prescription, please contact us to ensure everything is entered correctly. don't be shy; we are here to help, and we want your glasses to be made exactly to your doctor's specifications. your pupillary distance (p.d.) this measurement is necessary to ensure the correct positioning of your lenses within the frame you have chosen. have a friend* measure the distance from the center of the pupil (black dot) in one eye to the center of the pupil in the other eye. it's like measuring a line connecting the two black dots. to measure your pd: 01. place the millimeter ruler on the bridge of your nose. 02. have a friend face you about arms length away. 03. have your friend measure the distance between the center of your pupils (the black dots in the middle of your eyes). 04. (or you can do it yourself simply by looking in the mirror). you can also get this information from your doctor or from a licensed optician. as a guideline: + most adults' pd's are between 55-65. + most kids' pd's are between 42-54. download a printable ruler (pdf) download a ruler related topics patient glasses prescription (rx) rights glasses vs contacts rx differences faxing in your prescription our calling hours are: monday - friday 9:00am - 5:00pm (est) call us directly at: 1-631-816-2200 toll free within the us 1-800-672-6304 help sign in about your prescription about your pd accupd™ mobile pd tool about our frames how to buy prescription glasses online order tracking shipping options free returns worry free warranty vision insurance products blue495™ blue light blocker computer eyeglasses driving eyeglasses narrow eyeglasses round eyeglasses teen eyeglasses toddler eyeglasses lens price list 39dollarglasses about us create an account contact us help center blog resources affiliate program customer rewards social responsibility military discount © 2000-2020 39dollarglasses.com all rights reserved. accessibility adjustments accessibility statement privacy policy cookie policy site map x warranty type will be determined by the date of contact. all refunds/credits will be issued on date of receipt. returned items must be in original condition in the hard case you received from us. however you may keep any accessories as our free gift. what's your return policy? at 39dollarglasses.com, we offer a 100% worry-free guarantee! our objective is simple: to make sure every customer has a wonderful experience purchasing from us. if you are unhappy for any reason, you may return your eyeglasses for a one-time exchange at no cost or a full store credit for up to 90 days after delivery! we even provide free return shipping! alternatively, you may request a full refund* on your original order if you contact us within 30 days after delivery; shipping charges are non-refundable.
