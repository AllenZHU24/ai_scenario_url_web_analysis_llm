polycarbonate lenses all of our $39.00 complete pair packages are made using polycarbonate lenses; the lightest, most impact-resistant material made. with an index of refraction of 1.59, they are much thinner than standard (cr-39™ optical resin) optical lenses. they also come with both 100% uv and tough scratch-resistant coatings applied to both sides of the lenses, as well as polished lens edges, at no extra charge. polycarbonate is the required material for all children's eyeglasses because of its safety qualities - it's the material used to make bulletproof glass. for this reason, it's also the eye doctors' lens of choice for those with a blind eye or amblyopia (commonly called a "lazy eye"), where one eye's best-corrected vision is worse than the other eye. it ensures the good eye is always protected in case of an accident. standard polycarbonate lenses are recommended for prescription ranges between +/-4.00 (and/or cylinder ranges between +/-2.50). it can still be used for higher

ophthalmic lenses. progressives are sometimes referred to as "no-line bifocals", "no-line trifocals", or "vari-focals." they provide a graduated range of vision from distance to near, without a line. polarized lenses have filters that block out reflected light. they virtually eliminate the glare caused by reflections from horizontal surfaces, making them ideal for driving or water-activities. this filtering of incoming light (rather than darkening it) leads to sharper vision and better color vision. polarized lenses are naturally uv-protective and we apply our tough scratch-resistant coating to both lens surfaces. sometimes referred to as hard-resin, our base sun lenses are made using the highest optical-grade cr-39™ optical resin lenses. with an index of refraction of 1.50, cr-39™ optical resin is recommended for low-to-moderate prescriptions, between +3.00 and -4.00. if your prescription is higher than this, check out our polycarbonate polarized progressives. back to top cr-39™
