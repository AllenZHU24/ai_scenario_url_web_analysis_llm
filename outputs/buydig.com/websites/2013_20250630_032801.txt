6:52 pm | kitchen leave a comment tomorrow is thanksgiving here in the united states and i’m certain that everyone has dusted off their personal cookbooks for all the traditional american recipes. well, i like to go against the grain a bit so today’s recipes come from the old country. and by the old country, i mean scotland. i might actually dig out my slow cooker and give these a whirl myself. americanized version of haggis ingredients 1/2 pound ground beef 1/2 pound ground lamb 1 chopped red onion (doesn’t need to be diced, largish chunks are okay) 1 cup oats (if you are gluten free, make sure your oats are certified gf) pinch each of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 1/2 tsp black pepper 1 tsp kosher salt 1 egg 1/2 cup of broth or stock directions in a large mixing bowl, mix all of the ingredients, minus the broth, the same way you’d make a meatloaf. plop it into your slow cooker. i used a 4 qt round pot for this. i didn’t spray with cooking spray, but it might be a good idea. shape with your hands into a round blob. pour in your broth. cover and cook on low for 6-7 hours, or on high for about 4. this is cooked fully when it has browned on the edges and is beginning to brown on top. don’t overcook and risk drying out. using large spatulas, carefully remove and set on a cutting board. let rest for a full 30 minutes before slicing. slow cooker rice pudding ingredients 200g pudding rice (not normal rice) 60g sugar 50g butter 1.5l milk 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon cinnamon directions pop all the ingredients into a pre-heated slow cooker. cook for 8 hours on low, or 4 hours on high. give it a little stir after an hour or so, to mix the sugar and butter. keep an eye on it, and add a little more milk if needed. serve with a sprinkling of nutmeg, cinnamon or chocolate powder. tagged kitchen some more cool kitchen gadgets by barry dyson jr. | november 26, 2013 - 6:23 pm | housewares, kitchen leave a comment last week we talked about some great kitchen gifts for the cook in your life depending on how skilled that person is (from “can burn water” to “gordon ramsey”). right after that post went up, we started getting inundated with requests to find a few small gadgets that can go in a college dorm room or a small apartment where space is at a premium. having lived in a city where it was difficult to find space and having a separate kitchen was something of a luxury, i can completely sympathize. so, if you’ve been wondering what might go well in a college student’s dorm or a newlyweds’ tiny kitchenette, then we have three suggestions for you to try. first up, we have a table-top oven from fagor. this is perfect for people who have very little space but who still want to enjoy the benefits of a home-cooked meal. you can enjoy baked goods of all kinds — chicken, pizza, bread, roasts — without having to purchase a full-sized oven or have it installed. and, when you’re done with the oven, just set it aside until you need it again. as a bonus, the halogen heating element gets things cooked faster than the traditional convection oven resulting in a lower power or gas bill and less time having to be spent cooking. this little oven might also make a great gift for the person who never seems to have enough space in the oven for all the baking they want to do though it is mostly suited for people with small spaces and not a lot of time. second comes this proctor silex electric griddle. if you have a friend who just doesn’t have the space for a full-out stove, this griddle might be something useful for them to have. you can make a surprising variety of things on a griddle: pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, fried steaks, pork chops, chicken strips. with a bit of care, you can even use this griddle as a stove-top, giving you a place to boil some water, heat a pan, or do any number of things you’d normally do on a traditional range top. and, when you’re done, you can just wash it off and set it to the side until you need it again. ideal for those who need to economize their space, this griddle would also make a great gift for any cook. last, but certainly not least, comes this wonder of wonders. i saw this and immediately thought “i know eight people who would want something like this in their cubby-hole kitchens.” feast your eyes upon the maximatic elite cuisine 3 in 1 breakfast station. it makes coffee. it cooks biscuits. it fries eggs, bacon, and sausage. with a little bit of tweaking, it can be used to fry just about anything you can fit in a little skillet, you can make any kind of hot beverage (coffee, tea, hot chocolate) or soup, and you can heat up anything you can fit into the miniature stove. it’s marketed as a breakfast maker but really, it’s a little bitty tiny kitchen. this is also a great thing for people who only have to cook for themselves. after all, instead of messing up a huge skillet, a griddle, or an entire oven to warm up food for only one person, you can do it more quickly and efficiently (time and space wise) with this. so, if you’re still stumped over what to get someone for the holidays and you don’t want to overwhelm them with things that will take up a lot of space but only have a single use, try one of these gadgets. versatile, tiny, and multi-purpose. what’s not to love? holiday gift guides: gaming edition by barry dyson jr. | november 25, 2013 - 7:59 pm | gaming, geek, tech leave a comment the holidays are coming up and this is one of the years when the major game consoles are introducing a new generation. namely: sony has brought out the playstation 4 and microsoft is releasing the new xbox one. these two consoles come packed with loads of features including cleaner operating systems, more entertainment options, better hardware, better share-ability with companion devices, and new and improved controllers. however, there is one thing that this generation of consoles lacks that has a lot of people wary of making a purchase early on and that is: backwards compatibility. given how finicky consoles can be and that it’s annoying to have to get up and unplug and re-plug cables whenever you want to play a particular game, the ability for newer generations to be able to play games released for older generation consoles is something of a key feature for gamers. gamers tend to amass their collections over the years and enjoy going back and playing older games. that’s one area where the nintendo wii shines out: though you can’t load cartridges into it, you can go and purchase classic nintendo entertainment system games from the nintendo wii store and have them download directly to the console. so, if you’re like me and bit of a zelda fanatic, you can finally get your fix! however, there are rumors on the horizon that microsoft and sony will work with game developers to make older titles available for download through their online marketplaces. so, while you may not be able to play your old favorites on day one, you might eventually be able to play them. possibly. so, which console should you get? well, if you’re purchasing a console for one of your children who has, as of yet, not had decades to amass a mountain of games in a variety of formats like my room-mate and i have done, then you might want to check over a list of games available for both the playstation 4 and the xbox one and see which games your children might be most interested in before you commit to making a purchase. you should also look over the other options on both consoles: entertainment options (netflix, hulu, etc) and check your own video disc collection (do you have dvds or blu-ray? or both? do you import a lot of movies? do you need a regionless or easily modified player to play your non-us movies?) all in all, my personal opinion is to wait to make a purchase for a while. see if microsoft or sony will actually be able to follow through on their promises to make older titles available through their own online marketplace and then look to see if those prices are reasonable (like nintendo’s) or insane (like a college textbook). this year could have been a truly great year for gamers except that, in the rush to hit the market first, both sony and microsoft made some serious missteps with their latest consoles, turning hardcore gamers and casuals off. wrapping up the week by barry dyson jr. | november 22, 2013 - 2:45 pm | computers, copyright, geek, internet, law, random, tech leave a comment it’s friday again and this week has been a week featuring the long arm of the law in the tech world. one of the lead hackers for lulzsec was sentenced this week and the fbi issued advisories concerning hacking and internet traffic. patent trolls are finally getting hit in both the courts and the legislature as newegg and the us senate take aim at some of their more dubious claims. also, scanner trolls are getting their own comeuppance as they are forced to file suit in a classic “put up or shut up” challenge. the nsa is still being dragged through scandal-filled waters as more information about how it got permission to spy on everyone on earth (and probably anyone not on earth to boot). and, on top of all of these stories are the guides for the holidays and announcements about tech and gadgets to come at ces 2014. all of these stories and more were covered on our twitter feed this week. however, if you’re not following us on twitter then we’ll recap the top stories for you below. #lulzsec member sentenced to 10 years for #hacking intel firm #stratfor http://t.co/ozqgbmqhaz #tech #law #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 17, 2013 #fbi warns #hacking spree on government agencies is a “widespread problem” http://t.co/rr2126n5gc #tech #law #security #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 17, 2013 #fbi reports us agencies #hacked by #anonymous http://t.co/3g0ydm2wsg #tech #internet #security #privacy #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 17, 2013 from #geek street to main street: ride sharing's road to a mass market http://t.co/eo5hktqow9 #tech #gadget #internet — official buydig site (@buydig) november 18, 2013 #newegg hurtles toward texas showdown with famed “#patent #troll” http://t.co/pxhmtvqbwu #tech #law #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 18, 2013 #schneier tells washington #nsa broke #internet’s #security for everyone http://t.co/xk1mkieuep #tech #privacy #politics #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 18, 2013 #nj gamblers may be locked out by flaws in virtual fence http://t.co/tfhcmayigk #tech #law #politics #internet #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 18, 2013 #newegg on trial, day one: picking a #patent jury http://t.co/phpiffecfz #tech #internet #retail #law #policy #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 19, 2013 court order allowing #nsa data collection program revealed http://t.co/gzt1ctahqf #tech #law #privacy #security #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 19, 2013 second anti-#patent-troll bill shows up, and splits emerge on the first http://t.co/wiar1lwumb #tech #law #politics #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 19, 2013 chinese gov't to tighten #internet controls even further http://t.co/dqolxl8mxb #tech #policy #politics #privacy #security #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 19, 2013 repeated attacks hijack huge chunks of #internet traffic, researchers warn http://t.co/fbnfy9cy3s #tech #security #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 20, 2013 us senators say there’s “no evidence” bulk metadata surveillance is useful http://t.co/becwqmbkxa #tech #security #privacy #politics #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 20, 2013 ask slashdot: can you trust #online #tax software? http://t.co/ftmqxwqowk #tech #law #politics #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 20, 2013 anti-#patent-troll bill passes house judiciary committee on 33 to 5 vote http://t.co/ihgy6vduvl #tech #law #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 21, 2013 schmidt: censorship could vanish within a decade http://t.co/w73ovlahpj #tech #security #privacy #law #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 21, 2013 after a year of threats, first suit is filed over hated “#scanner #patents” http://t.co/k8t6qajf9a #tech #law #patenttrolls #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 21, 2013 #microsoft customers hit with new wave of #fake #tech #support calls http://t.co/ntecsu3eil #security #privacy #computer #geek — official buydig site (@buydig) november 21, 2013 that’s all for this week, everyone. have a great weekend and see you again next week. shopping for the holidays: kitchen edition by barry dyson jr. | november 21, 2013 - 6:43 pm | housewares, humor, kitchen leave a comment the holiday season is upon us again and that means it’s time to start trying to figure out what you’re going to get the various people in your life. this week, we’ll focus on various kitchen gadgets that might appeal to different people in your life. and remember, just because someone doesn’t like cooking doesn’t mean they can’t get some use out of something that will let them cook without the actual effort of cooking. if i could build a robot to do all of my cooking for me, i’d have done so already. so, let’s get started, shall we? not even a novice — we all have someone we know who can burn water. this is the person who cooks only because the alternative is starving. they usually go for take-out if they can get it. they use their microwave more frequently than any other object in the kitchen. so, what could you get for this person who loathes cooking? simple. a cuisinart perfec temp 12 cup coffee maker. yes, it’s a coffee maker. but it’s a simple one and it does all the work for you. and, it can make more than just coffee. a bit of tweaking and it can make tea, soup, and hot chocolate. also popular with this kind of cook are things like the proctor silex deep fryer (fried chicken without needing to flip it!) or even a slow cooker. chill, i got this — this person can usually be counted on to make simple meals without setting anything on fire. they have most of the common gadgets you’ll find in a kitchen and even know what most of them are supposed to be used for. so, what to get for them? indoor grills could be a good idea. i know that i wouldn’t mind a good panini maker (i love paninis). food processors are also a good idea. because, believe me, to listen to my mother speak, if you have one food processor, you need at least eight more. mine is the soup du jour — okay, there’s at least one in every family (two in mine). these are people who actually enjoy cooking. they experiment a bit. they’re not afraid of trying new things. and, somehow, they don’t think that cooking or mixing things is tedious and boring and they’re not bothered by the fact that the fruits of their labors are, in essence, disposable (we can tell that i’m not in this camp). however, we’re all glad that someone enjoys cooking. otherwise, the rest of us would never know that things could taste better than newsprint and charcoal. so, what do you get for the home chef who surely has everything they could want? how about things to make their lives a little easier? such as this cuisinart professional grilled meat thermometer. no more wondering if it’s golden brown or browny-gold! there’s also this nifty little electronic kitchen scale to help determine how to rework that recipe a bit to feed four instead of eight or twelve instead of two. they might also appreciate a wine chiller/warmer to help them keep the wines they’ve selected to go with the meal at the perfect temperature on the table. i get along with gordon ramsey — if you know a person who either is a professional chef or could pass for one, then chances are you know someone who has gadgets and gizmos in their kitchen that are more complicated than some home theater systems. what do you get for this person? the cook who definitely seems to have everything? well, a second set of things can often be quite useful! sure, they might have a set of knives already but another wouldn’t hurt them. and, even they might want an easier way to carve meat than using an old-fashioned fork and knife. more pressure cookers can let them get more done and a top-notch chef can never have enough baking sheets. a three-in-one slow cooker is something they might actually use and, if all else fails, they’ll be sure to need some storage containers to house all the leftovers. so, there you have it. if you’ve been struggling over your holiday lists, then we hope you’ll find this guide and our future guides helpful! weekly recipe: chocolate coated edition by barry dyson jr. | november 20, 2013 - 6:19 pm | kitchen leave a comment this week we have a couple of really great dessert recipes for all of you chocoholics out there. so, while you’re trying to figure out what to do with your traditional holiday dinners, you can relax knowing that these desserts will go over well as great after-dinner treats. diy peppermint patties ingredients: 1 pound confectioners sugar (powdered sugar) 4 ounces, cream cheese, softened ¼ teaspoon peppermint extract 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips directions: 1. using a mixer, gradually add the sugar to the cream cheese, beat well until incorporated. 2. add peppermint extract and combine well. 3. roll dough into teaspoon size balls and place on baking sheet(s) lined with wax paper or parchment. create a small “bowl” or indention in each ball using a ¼ teaspoon or your finger. cover with plastic wrap and let firm up in refrigerator for a few hours. 4. when peppermints have firmed, melt chocolate according to package directions (microwave is fine). fill a piping bag or freezer bag with the corner snipped with the melted chocolate. fill each mini peppermint bowl/indention with chocolate and let cool. 5. refrigerate in airtight container until ready to serve. helpful tips: when making the cream cheese/powdered sugar mixture, gradually add the powdered sugar until the right texture is achieved. you may end up needing to add a bit more than listed in the recipe, or less. it should hold together, but not sticky. if working by yourself, only make a few balls at a time before pressing the bowls/indention’s to avoid them drying and cracking. the best thing is to work with someone else and have one person roll the balls, while the other follows behind making the bowls/indentations. be sure to keep main peppermint mixture lightly covered with plastic or a damp paper towel while making the balls to avoid it drying out. easy chocolate peanut butter balls ingredients: 18oz jar of peanut butter 1/4 cup butter 2 cups powdered sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 oz bag of nestle’s semi- sweet morsels 1. mix the peanut butter, butter, vanilla extract and powdered sugar in a bowl. stir until combined. 2. shape into approximately 1-inch balls and place on baking pan. put in freezer for about 20 minutes. 3. melt nestle’s semi- sweet morsels according to pkg ( i microwaved ) 4. dip peanut butter balls into chocolate w/ toothpick letting the excess coating drip off. return the chocolate coated peanut butter balls back pan until chocolate is firm. 5. store in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator. tagged kitchen online patents and holiday shopping by barry dyson jr. | november 19, 2013 - 6:28 pm | geek, internet, law leave a comment it’s well understood that lawyers can mess up anything. that’s why so many of them go on to become politicians. however, since the internet got to be “a thing.” and lately, lawyers and patent trolls eager to lay claim to wealth they’ve not earned are taking aim at one of the most lucrative and now common things to do on the internet: online shopping. a mysterious company calling itself tqp development is currently suing newegg (and, if their suit is successful, will probably be suing every website that has a shopping cart and check out). last year, tqp development was able to wheedle a cool $40 million out of various companies by threatening to sue them. however, newegg stood up to them and refused to be shaken down. the trial is now going to be put before a jury who will decide if tqp development is in the right or the wrong. and, depending on how they’ve worded their patent, it could go either way quite easily. granted, though, that some judges have begun to rule that an activity that can be done off-line cannot be patented just by adding “over the internet” to it. in the early days of the internet, plenty of people were rushing to patent things like “a method for speaking across the internet,” “a method of sending a message over the internet,” “a method of storing information in a remote location.” their hopes were to get a nice, broad patent and then wait for someone else to build it and start making money off the idea. then, the patent holder (aka “patent troll”) would swoop in and demand a sizable cut of the proceeds. it was the best kind of legal scam ever dreamed up — a minimum of effort and investment for a maximum of profit. tqp development seems to be relying on such tactics in hopes that their method patent won’t be found overly broad or overly obvious and that they can continue to shake down other online retailers without actually having to do any investment or development themselves. as we head into the busiest shopping season of the year, stop and think of how much worse things would be if online shopping came to a halt because of one little pipsqueak patent troll. i know i certainly have no desire to fight the crowds on black friday (or, indeed, any time between black friday and new years). would you? wrapping up the week by barry dyson jr. | november 15, 2013 -

6:39 pm | copyright, ebooks, internet, tech, television leave a comment it goes without saying that the internet has lowered a lot of the barriers that used to keep people more isolated, less able to influence the world at large, and more reliant on gatekeepers in the media and entertainment industry to provide them with the information (news) or distraction (entertainment) that they needed. back in the era of radio broadcast transmission, this made sense. after all, the radio spectrum is fairly limited and there can only be a certain number of broadcasters in a given geographical location before the spectrum becomes so cluttered as to be useless. so, the government allocated the spectrum and three major commercial broadcast companies were formed to control it. however, in time research into cable, satellite, and other broadcast mediums that were not so limited began to turn into major methods of broadcasting themselves. instead of relying solely on aerial or rf broadcasting, people turned to cable providers, to satellite networks, and to other technologies that were quickly expanding the number of channels available for entertainment and news. when the internet arrived, suddenly the same kind of disruption began to hit the publishing and print industry. anyone with a computer and a bit of patience could build a website and create their own content. no longer did people have to rely on the “layers and layers of fact-checkers” (who failed to tell the difference between a 17th generation photocopy of a microsoft word document and an actual typed report from the 1970s) to decide which news stories to research, run, and air. instead, with the internet, people could reach out directly to those in the area of events or to others who might have a different take on things. as ebooks gained more and more credibility and ebook readers went from proprietary, heavily-locked down monsters to sleek, open, easily transferable tablets, authors no longer had to bow to a nepotistic and parochial publishing industry who had locked themselves away in an ivory tower and were quickly accused of being out of touch with at least half the population. authors were no longer forced to give up all rights to their works in exchange for access to a printing press. instead, they could retain their rights and print their work off their own press. musicians found themselves suddenly having the same freedom — especially once the cost of recording studio equipment went down as moore’s law kicked into high-gear. no longer did they have to hand over a pound of flesh to record label middle-men confined to four major cities (la, nyc, nashville, portland). no longer did the labels have the power of payola over radio and the ability to decide who would be played on the air and, just as importantly, who wouldn’t be. musicians could go directly to their audiences over the internet and sell their music that way without needing a bunch of middle-men taking a cut. and now, television and movie studios are starting to really feel the heat. when anyone can set up a filming studio in their backyard and get their hands on some pretty high-quality cameras and sound gear, then the days of a tiny handful of writers, editors, and producers who live and jet between two cities (nyc and hollywood) having complete say over how the rest of the world is portrayed are drawing to an end. we’re in the middle of a great cultural renaissance and it’s all because of the disruption that the digital revolution has kicked off. and that is really, really great. 12›» blogroll buydig.com c|net good enough mother popehat slashdot techdirt archives november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 @buydigalltop tech news our recent pins followed by 2552 people.?pinterest badge by skipser sweepstakes! buydig nexus 7 giveaway! cash sweeps bigsweeps.com -
