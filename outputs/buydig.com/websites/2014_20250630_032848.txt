5:18 pm | housewares, how stuff works, tech leave a comment i know that some of you are staring at the title and thinking “how on earth is sewing techie?” well, trust me, considering the number of times i’ve had to help my mother reprogram her sewing machine or connect her laptop to it so she could download new patterns or designs onto it, sewing is no longer a fusty art practiced by women in rocking chairs. it is serious business and very, very high-tech these days. take, for example, this machine from singer. it can do quilting, sewing, stitching, embroidery. with the right settings, it might even be able to shear the sheep, card the wool, spin the thread, and then sew the shirt without any direction from a human being. if these machines get any more advanced, i might actually be able to learn to sew. if by “learn to sew,” you mean “plug in the sewing machine and let it do everything while i stand back in fear and awe of our robotic sewing machine overlords.” for someone who can barely sew a hem, it’s incredible that these machines are getting so computerized that i’m actually considering getting one and seeing what it can do. additionally, in this internet age, there are many people who get sewing machines, use their knowledge of the craft to make some fairly awesome things, and then make a nice living by selling their wares or bartering their talents on sites like esty or ebay. i bought a welcome mat from one such person and i’m very happy with it. if you had one of these machines at your disposal, what would you make? have you recovered from the walking dead season 5 midseason finale? by barry dyson jr. | december 2, 2014 - 2:20 pm | geek, television, tributes, whoa leave a comment and the award for longest blog title ever goes to… fair warning: there be spoilers for coda, the season five midseason finale for the walking dead below. if you haven’t seen this episode and don’t want spoilers, stop reading here and come back after you’ve seen it. if you have seen it and, like so many of the rest of us, need to feel like you’re not alone in being emotionally traumatized by the loss of a fictional character, then pull up a seat and know that we’re meeting weekly on thursdays. next week, bring pie. so, on a scale of one to lost a fight with mohammed ali, how sucker-punched were you at the end of coda? me, i felt as if i had been on a starship that made the jump to warp two hundred without inertial dampners. “floored” doesn’t begin to cover it. i pretty much just curled up in the fetal position saying “this is just a bad dream. the actual episode hasn’t aired yet. this is just a dream and i’m going to wake up any minute now and she’ll still be there, singing and laughing.” watching the talking dead episode immediately after where emily started tearing up made me feel as if andre the giant had hit me in the chest with a sledgehammer. the worst part is, it didn’t need to happen. beth could have walked away. she could have just let it drop. a few moments of thinking and she could have picked her battle better. dawn was not going to be in charge of things very much longer — the others were going to make certain of that. rick could have probably talked them into a better arrangement. but no. she had to go and do something that got her killed. i can understand why she did it. i just…really, really, really wanted her to make it out. she had already grown so much from when we first met her. i wanted to see how she would turn out. and now, we won’t get to see that. all that potential is just gone. that’s the dictionary definition of “tragedy.” now, that said, i am not going to give up on the walking dead nor am i angry with the writers and producers. everything happens for a reason — even some of the best characters dying has a part in driving the plot forward. heart-shattered (“broken” doesn’t come near to covering it) as i am, i want to see how the rest of them handle it. which just makes me remember that, come february, just as the wounds are starting to heal, we’re all going to have to relive the trauma as we watch daryl, carol, rick, maggie, and the rest struggle with their latest loss. i’m not certain whether i’m looking forward to that or dreading it or some weird mix of both. however, i am certain that someone had better bring pie to our next walking dead bereavement support group or there will be consequences. tasty, tasty consequences. maybe cupcakes. wrapping up the week by barry dyson jr. | november 28, 2014 -

3:05 pm | kitchen leave a comment with thanksgiving tomorrow, everyone who is planning to cook up a feast has probably already settled on the recipes they’re planning to use for the main, side, and dessert dishes. we’re not looking to add more stress to the preparations for the big holiday feast by suggesting that someone change their plans here at the last minute. however, we do want to help out. so, to do that, we’ve got a couple of great margarita recipes to help all of the cooks (who are 21 and older) relax after the cooking is done and the dish detail has taken over the kitchen out of gratitude for a meal well-prepared. it goes without saying, of course, that the first step of any recipe involving alcohol is “put the car keys away” and the second step is “drink responsibly.” assuming that you’ve completed those two vital pre-recipe steps, feel free to proceed to the “make and enjoy” stage and try one of the drinks below! frozen mint margarita ingredients 1 cup sugar 1 cup packed fresh mint leaves 2 cups water 3/4 cup tequila, divided 1/2 cup fresh lime juice (about 4 limes) 2 tablespoons grand marnier (orange-flavored liqueur) 3 to 4 dashes angostura bitters (optional) directions combine first 3 ingredients and 1/2 cup tequila in a medium saucepan over medium heat; cook 3 minutes or until tiny bubbles form around edge of pan. remove tequila mixture from heat; steep 15 minutes. strain through a sieve into a bowl; discard mint. stir in juice, grand marnier, and remaining 1/4 cup tequila. cool to room temperature. add bitters, if desired. place mixture in a zip-top plastic bag; seal and freeze 2 hours (alcohol will separate). knead bag to combine mixture. pour 2/3 cup margarita into each of 6 margarita glasses. jamaica margarita ingredients 1 cup dried hibiscus blossoms* (about 2 ounces) 3 cups water 3/4 cup sugar 1 1/4 cups tequila 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1/3 cup triple sec or other orange-flavored liqueur 8 lime slices directions place blossoms in a strainer; rinse under cold water. combine blossoms, water, and sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. strain; discard blossoms. cover and chill hibiscus mixture. combine hibiscus mixture, tequila, juice, and triple sec. serve over ice. garnish with lime slices. *hibiscus blossoms can be found at latin grocery stores. boiling the blossoms in a sugar-water mixture and then steeping infuses more flavor than just steeping them in warm water. this drink is especially good when made with premium-quality tequila. tagged kitchen tech talk tuesday: nikon d810 review by barry dyson jr. | november 25, 2014 - 3:10 pm | photography, reviews, tech leave a comment earlier this month, we received a nikon d810 dslr with an 18 – 140 mm lens to take out and test. after several weeks of going around and capturing some interesting images around town, i can safely say that the d810 is a great camera for the novice or the more experienced photographer. it has intuitive controls, handles switching between different modes and environments very well, and has a smooth learning curve. first, though, let’s talk specs. the nikon d810 has a 36.3 megapixel sensor measuring 35.9 mm x 24 mm, excellent auto focusing and image stabilization built-in to the camera, and can capture continuous 5 frames per second for still images. it has the standard sd slot as well as a cf slot, can connect to a computer via a usb cable, can be set for low or high lighting environments with an iso sensitivity running from iso 64 – 12,800. it comes with a plethora of modes including portrait, landscape, nighttime, indoor, and action modes to let you flip between settings quickly and easily. the tech specs on the d810 are nothing to sneeze at — it’s one of nikon’s best new full-frame dslrs to date. however, technical specifications only tell a small part of the story when it comes to this camera. the real story comes with using it. the controls, as said earlier, are extremely intuitive. you may need to consult the manual for some of the more advanced features and menus but, for the most part, you can pick up this camera, charge the battery and insert it, and start taking photos quickly. even switching into manual and adjusting the iso, aperture, and shutter settings is easy. once you get the hang of it, you can take some rather stunning photos even if, like me, you’re a complete novice at photography. another great thing is the ability to quickly and easily switch between modes and automated settings and then flip back to manual and dial in the more detailed settings without having to start over again. some cameras will punt you straight back to your previous manual settings but the d810 doesn’t do that — if you change the mode from portrait to landscape and then go to manual, it keeps the settings from default landscape so you can make tweaks to the settings from there. this is an absolute gift if you’re doing outdoor photography since you will wind up spending a lot of time adjusting the white balance and iso to get the exact effects you want. or, at least you’ll do that if you’re as picky as i am. one annoyance i ran into, though, is taking photos in a shaded area with the sun out. frequently, i had to move around to get enough light even with low light settings dialed in. the d810, like many other cameras, had a hard time figuring out what to do when i was standing in a lit area but shooting into a shaded area in the woods. however, much of that can probably be put down to photographer error because, otherwise, the camera frequently seemed to read my mind when on auto mode. lastly, this camera has an nice and easy learning curve. within three hours, i felt like i had a really good handle on most of the modes and settings on the d810. true, there are probably many more things i have to learn and the manual has come in handy for showing me some things i’ve missed but, overall, i am quite happy with this camera and have plans to add it to my wish list for christmas. motion picture monday: big gaming news by barry dyson jr. | november 24, 2014 - 4:33 pm | gaming, geek, tech leave a comment the past few weeks have seen the release of several new big video game titles. if there is a gamer in your life, chances are that they may be looking forward to getting one of these great games for christmas. however, as a non-gamer, you might not know what the games are about or whether they are appropriate or not for certain ages. so, in an act of extreme sacrifice, i have sat down and played through some of the top titles so that you don’t have to. the first game up is sid meier’s civilization: beyond earth. this is a quasi real-time strategy game where the goal is to become the top civilization through whatever means you decide to try. earlier civilization games, such as the still hugely popular civilization v, let you achieve victory by diplomatic, scientific, or conquering means. civilization: beyond earth continues that trend. it’s got a steeper learning curve than earlier civilization games. starting with the premise that you are leading a colony seeking to establish itself on an alien world, civilization: beyond earth takes the gameplay to a completely different scale than earlier games. it is quite easy to while away an entire night in this turn-based strategy game. the game is rated e for everyone but does contain mild fantasy violence and requires a good grasp on planning and strategy as well as reading so it is not recommended for young children unless they have a parent to help them with some of the more complicated controls and information screens. the next game up is world of warcraft: warlords of draenor. world of warcraft has been around for ten years — a record in the world of mmorpgs (massively multiplayer online roleplaying games). most mmos peter out after five years but world of warcraft is still going strong after ten. warlords of draenor takes place in a new version of draenor (the outlands from the burning crusade) where things are different due to the warchief garrosh hellscream mucking with the timeline. many of the classes have beefed up spells and abilities. there are, as always with a wow expansion, new dungeons, raids, and quests along with new areas to explore, new profession skills to learn, and a new twist to an age-old tale. however, anyone looking to get started with warlords of draenor should know that world of warcraft, like any mmorpg, is a massive time-sink. however, wow’s creator, blizzard, does allow for parents to set up parental controls on their children’s battle.net accounts to ensure that homework is done and bedtime is respected. parents are also encouraged to monitor their children’s friends and contacts to make certain that no personal information is being exchanged until the parents have given permission for it to be done. the game itself is rated t for teen with fantasy violence. the game itself contains no explicit nudity very little foul language. the last big title to check out is dragon age: inquisition. this is the latest installment in the dragon age universe and continues the journeys started in dragon age: origins and dragon age ii. bioware has even set up a website to help players from the original games import their settings and decisions into inquisition so that they don’t have to start all over again. throughout the game, the main character — a character whose role and position is strictly up to the player — finds and recruits allies in their quest to return order to thedas. dragon age: inquisition contains a massive world with much to explore and many side quests to join in. players can easily spend up to sixty hours completing the main storyline and probably sixty to eighty hours beyond that tracking down all of the side quests. the game is rated m for mature meaning it should be played only by those age 18 and up. companions can be romanced, as in dragon age: origins, and the game does contain intense fantasy violence, blood, and sexual content. the main quest itself also requires the player to have a fairly mature outlook and sometimes gives them only the choice between bad and worse. if you’re looking for something to give the gamer in your life this holiday, these three games are great for gamers of various ages and will give hours of great gaming entertainment making them well worth the price. wrapping up the week by barry dyson jr. | november 21, 2014 - 3:17 pm | computers, copyright, gaming, geek, law, privacy, random, science, tech leave a comment it’s been another interesting week in the world of tech. this week has seen apple achieve some significant victories and losses as things heat up for the holiday season. there have been new bug-fixes for ios as well as a patent drubbing in court and microsoft deciding to start the holidays with the spirit of mockery for apple. in addition to these normal travails in the tech wars, there have been many stories about the best gadgets and games to get for the geek in your life this holiday season. all of these stories and more were featured on our twitter feed. however, if you’re not following us on twitter, we’ll recap the highlights for you below. eclipsed moon in the morning http://t.co/shhji8asue #astrophotography #astronomy #apod @nasa — buydig.com (@buydig) november 14, 2014 the nexus 10, lollipop, and the problem with big android #tablets http://t.co/iwhwkxqkc2 #tech #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 17, 2014 microsoft gets in the holiday spirit with latest apple-bashing ad http://t.co/v1hhemr2a1 #tech #gadget #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 17, 2014 rightscorp nails 30,000 users for piracy in one month, still loses money http://t.co/r6lpmyknum #tech #law #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 17, 2014 self-tracking suitcase passes $1m on indiegogo http://t.co/xfkttioo4b #tech #travel #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 17, 2014 at&t demands clarity: are warrants needed for customer cell-site data? http://t.co/jrjlzwszm4 #tech #law #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 18, 2014 ios 8.1.1 brings bug fixes, hope for iphone 4s and ipad 2 device owners http://t.co/x3njvz1avc #tech #gadget #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 18, 2014 court agrees that google’s search results qualify as free speech http://t.co/iyauxadh1z #tech #law #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 18, 2014 nyc launches free gigabit speed wi-fi network http://t.co/juxoxlo1ou #tech #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 18, 2014 jury: apple must pay $23.6m for old pager patents http://t.co/preaykqsoo #tech #law #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 19, 2014 us senate falls two votes short of shutting down nsa phone spying http://t.co/fmch3cxwog #tech #law #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 19, 2014 #tbt: remember this book? made just for the little astronaut in your life… http://t.co/861knrmfpm http://t.co/ec2t8eesae — buydig.com (@buydig) november 20, 2014 apple relabels “free” download buttons on itunes and mac app store to “get” following pressure from ec http://t.co/nn6cw6jukt #tech #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 20, 2014 cisco expects to pay $188m to rockstar, the apple-owned patent licensor http://t.co/givescmhx7 #tech #gaming #geek — buydig.com (@buydig) november 20, 2014 that’s all for this week, folks! have a great weekend and see you again next week. throwback thursday: the first doctor (doctor who) by barry dyson jr. | november 20, 2014 - 3:38 pm | geek, television leave a comment it’s a bit of an adage in the whovian world that “you never forget your first doctor.” usually this means that you’ll always remember (and probably have an overly-strong attachment to) the incarnation of the doctor whom you see the first time you watch doctor who. and, with the show being the longest running series in history (fifty-one years and counting), there are twelve incarnations to choose from. however, the person who made doctor who possible and who first brought the doctor to life fifty-one years ago this coming sunday deserves a very special mention in who history which is why today, for throwback thursday, we’re looking at the very first doctor played by william hartnell. the first doctor was the one who set the tone for all the future regenerations. he began his adventures through time and space as an old man, a time lord who had grown into his elder years naturally. with his granddaughter susan, the doctor stole a tardis (time and relative dimension in space) and escaped from gallifrey. along the way, he picked up several companions beginning with ian and barbara, two of susan’s teachers on earth. he got accidentally engaged to an aztec woman named carmica, was the first to encounter the daleks and the cybermen (two villains who play a major role in who history), and was also the first to regenerate. the first doctor was a crotchy, irascible old man who could be by turns arrogant and childlike. he was full of wonder about the universe but wanted to be in control of everything. he also had a habit of getting tongue-tied, something that was used to cover up the fact that harntell suffered from arteriosclerosis which made it difficult for him to remember his lines. doctor who was one of the first television series where female characters were treated as equal to the male characters. the show has always been a bit of a trailblazer, looking to the future and honoring the past. the actors who have portrayed the doctor over the past half century have been a diverse lot. however, harntell, the man who started it all, has a special place in who history for anyone who enjoys this quirky british sci-fi show. wednesday recipes: turkey time! by barry dyson jr. | november 19, 2014 - 3:15 pm | housewares, kitchen leave a comment thanksgiving is just eight days away and that means it’s time to get serious about preparing. if you haven’t picked out your bird yet, you might want to go and do that before this weekend. also, if you’ve got your side items selected or, if like many others, you’re doing potluck, then once you have your big, beautiful turkey, there is only one decision left to make: do you want to fry it or roast it? please be advised that if you decide to fry it, you will still need to thaw it, first. some friends and i made this mistake in college once we discovered we had forgotten to take the turkey out of the freezer the night before. figuring that frying it would cause it to thaw (and that the melting water would keep it from drying out), we heated the deep fryer up to ridiculous heat and let the iceball bird dive in. it remained in the hot oil for about ten seconds before the ice flashed to steam and the normally-flightless turkey took to the air in a ballistic arc, landing in the nearby swimming pool. also, if you do decide to go with frying, please be careful with the hot oil! don’t overheat it, avoid splashing it when you put the turkey in, and don’t overfill the basin. regardless of whether you fry or roast this year, we’ve got a recipe for you! erick’s deep fried rosemary turkey ingredients 1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed 1/2 cup minced garlic salt and ground black pepper to taste 3 gallons peanut oil for frying 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 12 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 cup chopped fresh ginger root directions fill an outdoor deep-fryer with the peanut oil (see tip below), and heat to 325 degrees f (160 degrees c). this will take about 30 minutes. rub the turkey with minced garlic, salt and pepper on the inside and outside. fill the cavity with rosemary, garlic cloves and ginger. refrigerate for 30 minutes to marinate. remove the herbs and garlic from the cavity of the bird, and discard. make sure the opening at the neck of the turkey is at least 2 inches wide. trim skin back if necessary. this will prevent pressure from building inside. if the turkey has a pop-up doneness indicator, it must be removed beforehand. place the turkey in the fryer basket, or hanging device, and slowly lower it into the hot oil. be sure to maintain the temperature of the oil while it is frying. cook for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature is at 180 degrees f (82 degrees c) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. carefully remove the turkey from the hot oil, and turn off the deep-fryer. let the bird cool for 5 minutes, then pat dry. perfect roast turkey ingredients 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 fresh turkey (10 to 12 pounds) kosher salt freshly ground black pepper 1 large bunch fresh thyme 1 whole lemon, halved 1 spanish onion, quartered 1 head garlic, halved crosswise directions preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. melt the butter in a small saucepan. add the zest and juice of the lemon and 1 teaspoon of thyme leaves to the butter mixture. set aside. take the giblets out of the turkey and wash the turkey inside and out. remove any excess fat and leftover pinfeathers and pat the outside dry. place the turkey in a large roasting pan. liberally salt and pepper the inside of the turkey cavity. stuff the cavity with the bunch of thyme, halved lemon, quartered onion, and the garlic. brush the outside of the turkey with the butter mixture and sprinkle with salt and pepper. tie the legs together with string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the turkey. roast the turkey about 2 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and the thigh. remove the turkey to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil; let rest for 20 minutes. slice the turkey and serve. tagged kitchen 12›» blogroll buydig.com c|net good enough mother slashdot techdirt archives select month december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 alltop tech news our recent pins followed by 5046 people.?pinterest badge by skipser sweepstakes! cash sweeps bigsweeps.com -
