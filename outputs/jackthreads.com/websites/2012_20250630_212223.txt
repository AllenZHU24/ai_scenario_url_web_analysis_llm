most in-stock orders arrive 5-7 business days after you place your order, but if you look at the product page you'll notice the estimated delivery date below the "add to cart" button. to check on estimated arrival of pending orders, go to your account page and click the order number. sometimes -- to offer you even deeper discounts -- we offer pre-sales, meaning we don't physically have the inventory in stock during the time of the sale. once the sale is over we place an order for everything you've bought, and it is shipped to our warehouse. from there we send it to you. sometimes these custom orders take brands longer to fulfill (sometimes 3-4 weeks), but once they reach us they're sent to you with the same speed as in-stock purchases. if this still doesn't answer your question, please use the comments box below to submit your question to us. i need to cancel or modify my order use the comments box below to send us your request, along with your order number. if you want to remove a specific item or items, please list them in detail. if you would like to add an item to your order, please make a separate purchase for those items and send us a note using the box below. make sure to include both order numbers and we will combine your two orders as long as they have not been sent to the warehouse. please note: orders that have already been sent to our warehouse for packing and shipping cannot be canceled or modified. if this still doesn't answer your question, please use the comments box below to submit your question to us. i need to change the address on my order visit your account and click on the order number that you need to change. if you can change your address you will see a link in the upper-right hand corner of the page that says "change shipping/billing address." please note: orders that have already been sent to our warehouse for packing and shipping cannot be canceled or modified. if this still doesn't answer your question, please use the comments box below to submit your question to us. i received an incorrect/damaged item if you have received an incorrect or damaged item, please follow the steps below: visit https://www.jackthreads.com/returns and get an rma number (if you don't see your item because it was purchased during a final sale please contact us using the comments box below). select the incorrect or damaged item from the list and choose the reason for return from the drop-down menu. if the item is damaged, please describe the damage in the additional comments box. click continue, review the items to return, and click "process return." using your rma number, fill out this form so we can send you a prepaid shipping label. if we cannot replace your item then we will refund your credit card the cost of the item. if this still doesn't answer your question, please use the comments box below to submit your question to us. when will i receive credit for my return?
