normally, order cancellation is not possible post checkout. once checkout is complete, all orders are pulled, packed and moved from individual order warehouses to a central processing facility. because of our volume, bulk pallets of orders are picked up by ups and fedex every hour, but tracking may not be available for up to 72 hours when the item is scanned at the carrier central processing facility. once this process is in motion, it is impossible to stop. additionally, payment/order fulfillment contracts (visa, mc, amex, discover, paypal, google) forbids merchants from making any post order changes to orders. in other words, this means that legally we must fill every order exactly as sent. we do not get paid if we make any post order address, shipping or product changes. if you change your mind about your on-line order after checkout, you may request a return materials authorization (rma) number. please use the following link http://www.antonline.com/request_rma.php. or go to http://www.antonline.com and click on the rma icon to request an rma. my package has been shipped but they have not delivered it yet. why?
