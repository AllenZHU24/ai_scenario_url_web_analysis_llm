https://www.antonline.com support support ticket about us returns support ticket order status faq corporate accounts careers support ticket order number: must include dashes (if applicable) and match exact number of digits (or enter packing slip po number): shipping zip code: email address: what is your issue?: request ticket support ticket faq please read carefully, before opening a support ticket. most customer questions are covered by the faq section. please understand that we get all of our product information contained in our listings from the manufacturer. they provide all of the specific product information, details, and specifications we have regarding products in our item listings. we have no additional information regarding any products, therefore, we cannot respond to product detail inquiries. the product manufacturer is always the best source for this information. for return requests (rma) please use our rma form. or go to www.antonline.com and click on the support menu. our customer service support desk is open m-f, 9:00am - 5:30pm est (eastern standard time). support tickets are normally addressed within 1 business day unless the support issue is addressed by the faq section, or it is an rma issue. (i.e. support tickets opened on thursday will typically be addressed by close of business friday and support tickets opened on friday will typically be answered by close of business monday unless covered by faq or rma). issues addressed in the faq section or via the rma process are not addressed in the support ticket system. please do not open multiple support tickets for the same invoice, as only the first ticket opened per issue will be addressed. order lookup faq what is my order number? it is a transaction identifying number assigned by the website you purchased on. can i call sales for my order number? no. for transaction security, and to comply with credit card processing regulations, all orders are tracked exclusively by order number. no transaction information can be accessed by sales personnel without a valid order number. what about the numbers shown on the packing slip? can these numbers be used to track orders? no. these are internal warehouse package routing numbers, which may come from one of several warehouses and/or regional hubs. they are generated by separate, isolated systems and are not associated with your order information. this is my last resort - i have tried every number i can find and nothing seems to work. can anyone manually search through the millions of records for my order? we can try, but without the order number, this may not be possible. our staff members use the same order look-up tools we have provided to you, so if you are not able to find your order, understand that we might not be able to either. send an email support@antonline.com with as much information you can about your order. include the website you purchased your order through, the email address on the order, the complete shipping address and zip code, the name on the order, and any additional information you have. you will only receive a response if someone was able to find the order. this can be a long process involoving several warehouses, datacenters, and regional hubs, including our vendor, courier, and marketplace parters - so please be patient. if you have not received a response after 5 business days, we were not able to find your order. | payments | | | | | | nextag trusted | about us commercial accounts privacy policy support ticket terms of sale returns opt in or out of promotions careers © copyright 1996 - 2019 antonline.com atlanta network technologies, inc is not responsible for typographical or photographical errors. prices and specifications are subject to change without notice. add to cart to see price the "add to cart to see price" message indicates an additional discount is in effect, and this discount is calculated in the shopping cart. you can see this price by adding this item to your shopping cart. please be assured that simply adding an item to your cart does not obligate you to buy it--you can always delete the item from your cart if you decide not to purchase it.
