digits shipping zip code: request rma order lookup faq what is my order number? it is a transaction identifying number assigned by the website you purchased on. can i call sales for my order number? no, for transaction security, and to comply with credit card processing regulations, all orders are tracked exclusively by order number. no transaction information can be accessed by sales personnel without a valid order number. what about the numbers shown on the packing slip? can these numbers be used to track orders? no, these are internal warehouse routing numbers (we have 7 warehouses and 3 regional hubs) and are not tied to your order number or order tracking. they are from a separate system and cannot be cross-referenced with order information. this is my last resort - i have tried every number i can think of and nothing seems to work. can anyone manually search through the millions of orders antonline.com receives to look for my order? i understand this may not be possible. we can try, but this is a long shot and we won't get back to you if we can't find it. email support@antonline.com and enter all the information you can about your order, including the website you purchased through, the email address associated with the order, the shipping address and zip code, and the name on the order. we will try to find it manually, and get back to you in a few days if we find any info. we have the same order look-up tools we have provided to you, so if you can't find your own order, we might not be able to either. | payments | | | | | | nextag trusted | about us
