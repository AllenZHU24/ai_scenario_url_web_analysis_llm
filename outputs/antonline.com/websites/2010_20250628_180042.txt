the tracking numbers for each days shipped orders are automatically emailed after 6:30pm eastern standard time. my tracking number is not working. what should i do? sometimes the warehouse draws extra tracking numbers that do not get used when they discover that the items can be packaged together safely. this results in "dummy numbers". other times, a package gets separated from its order and does not get scanned by the shipper correctly. either way, give it a day or two to see if all the items on your order arrive. if not email us at support@antonline.com and we will advise on beginning the lost package process. how do i contact the shipper? fedex: 1-800-go-fedex www.fedex.com ups: 1-800-pick-ups www.ups.com ups mail innovations: 1-800-500-2224 www.ups-mi.com usps: 1-800-ask-usps www.usps.com my package has been shipped but they have not delivered it yet. why? please contact the shipper to obtain further status on your packages. the priority of delivery within the method of shipment chosen is determined by your shipper. antonline.com would always like for your packages to be delivered asap. if the shipper is holding them, please contact them. what should i do if an item is delivered damaged? if the item appears to have obvious damage by the shipper, immediately tell the driver you do not want to receive this package. if the damaged package was left or someone else signed for it, there is a grace period of around 3 days to file the damage claim. if a package looks suspiciously damaged, you can tell the driver to wait and open it to make sure the contents are not damaged and then if they are refuse the package claiming the damage. obtain a control number from the shipper and email us at support@antonline.com. if the item appears to be damaged straight from the manufacturer, immediately email antonline.com support at support@antonline.com. always make sure to get the shipper's damage package control number for your claim. what should i do if an item is missing from my order? check the amount of tracking numbers you should have received. verify you have received all boxes and checked all packing material for small items. if you are still missing an item(s), email antonline.com customer service at support@antonline.com. why was my order sent in multiple packages when it could have all fit into one box? antonline.com packages the items according to safety for your items, weight, and size. the most common reason multiple boxes are used is due to multiple warehouse locations. obviously if the items are stocked in different warehouses then they cannot be boxed together. why did the shipper separate the packages of my order? that would be a function of the shipper. please contact the shipper to obtain further status on your packages. how can i get the shipper to leave a package without requiring a signature? what is a release waiver? as long as a tracking number has not been generated, you can contact the shipper and put in a "signature waiver" to either require or not require a signature for delivery. if a tracking number has been generated for your order and once the shipper attempts an initial delivery, they will leave a delivery notice on your door. on the reverse side you’ll find the same "signature release waiver". fill it out and they will follow your instructions on their next delivery attempt. some drivers will leave a package if they are familiar with the neighborhood and consider it safe to do so. that is completely up to the driver. are shipping costs added cumulatively for each item i order or do they reduce when multiple items are purchased? when you order multiple items, most of the time the shipping is reduced in your shopping cart, according to weight and size, safety and insurance required. just place all items in the shopping cart, pick your state and method of shipping and you will be given shipping options. you will see the reduction if it applies. on certain items, due to significant shipping discounts offered by antonline on the item, the shipping will add cumulatively, unless multiple items are purchased. shipping charge is always per the website. does antonline.com need to verify my shipping address if i pay using a paypal account? if the shipping address in your antonline.com order form does not match your confirmed shipping address listed in your paypal account, your order will be cancelled due to the discrepancy in order to deter fraudulent activity. any funds removed from the account will subsequently be restored. if your order is void because the shipping addresses do not match, simply re-submit the order on our website using the verified shipping address listed in your paypal account. my account login/register forgot username or password customer support contact us shipping faq request rma privacy statement terms of sale sitemap product support rebates manufacturer support company info letter from the ceo join our newsletter ©copyright 1996-2010 antonline (atlanta network technologies, inc) alanta network technologies, inc is not responsible for typographical or photographical errors.  prices and specifications are subject to change without notice.
