antonline.com will do everything possible to keep you informed of your order via e-mail. your tracking number will be emailed to you once the item is shipped. if you would like to submit a request to check on the status of your order, click here how do i track my order? to track your order, you must first obtain your tracking number. the tracking numbers for each day's shipped orders are automatically emailed once their container is processed and scanned at the carrier central processing facility up to 72 hours after shipment. the tracking number can be used on the shippers website or when contacting the shipper directly. the contact information for the shippers are as follows: fedex: 1-800-go-fedex www.fedex.com ups: 1-800-pick-ups www.ups.com ups mail innovations: 1-800-500-2224 www.ups-mi.com usps: 1-800-ask-usps www.usps.com for more answers to questions about shipping, see faq http://www.antonline.com/faq_orders.php. how do i get my order number? antonline.com order numbers are shown on your onscreen confirmation page and in your order confirmation email. for amazon and other merchant sites this number is shown on amazon's (or other merchant's) onscreen confirmation page and in their order confirmation email. can i cancel my order once it is placed? normally, order cancellation is not possible post checkout. once checkout is complete, all orders are pulled, packed and moved from individual order warehouses to a central processing facility. because of our volume, bulk pallets of orders are picked up by ups and fedex every hour, but tracking may not be available for up to 72 hours when the item is scanned at the carrier central processing facility. once this process is in motion, it is impossible to stop. additionally, payment/order fulfillment contracts (visa, mc, amex, discover, paypal, google) forbids merchants from making any post order changes to orders. in other words, this means that legally we must fill every order exactly as sent. we do not get paid if we make any post order address, shipping or product changes. if you change your mind about your on-line order after checkout, you may request a return materials authorization (rma) number. please use the following link http://www.antonline.com/request_rma.php. or go to http://www.antonline.com and click on the rma icon to request an rma. my package has been shipped but they have not delivered it yet. why? please contact the shipper to obtain further status on your packages. the priority of delivery within the method of shipment chosen is determined by your shipper. antonline.com would always like for your packages to be delivered asap. if the shipper is holding them, please contact them. what should i do if an item is delivered damaged? if the item appears to have obvious damage by the shipper, immediately tell the driver you do not want to receive this package. if the damaged package was left or someone else signed for it, there is a grace period of around 3 days to file the damage claim. if a package looks suspiciously damaged, you can tell the driver to wait and open it to make sure the contents are not damaged and then if they are refuse the package claiming the damage. obtain a control number from the shipper and email us at support@antonline.com. if the item appears to be damaged straight from the manufacturer, immediately email antonline.com support at support@antonline.com. always make sure to get the shipper's damage package control number for your claim. what should i do if an item is missing from my order? check the amount of tracking numbers you should have received. verify you have received all boxes and checked all packing material for small items. if you are still missing an item(s), email antonline.com customer service at support@antonline.com. why was my order sent in multiple packages when it could have all fit into one box? antonline.com packages the items according to safety for your items, weight, and size. the most common reason multiple boxes are used is due to multiple warehouse locations. obviously if the items are stocked in different warehouses then they cannot be boxed together. why did the shipper separate the packages of my order? that would be a function of the shipper. please contact the shipper to obtain further status on your packages. are shipping costs added cumulatively for each item i order or do they reduce when multiple items are purchased? when you order multiple items, most of the time the shipping is reduced in your shopping cart, according to weight and size, safety and insurance required. just place all items in the shopping cart, pick your state and method of shipping and you will be given shipping options. you will see the reduction if it applies. on certain items, due to significant shipping discounts offered by antonline on the item, the shipping will add cumulatively, unless multiple items are purchased. shipping charge is always per the website. does antonline.com need to verify my shipping address if i pay using a paypal account? if the shipping address in your antonline.com order form does not match your confirmed shipping address listed in your paypal account, your order will be cancelled due to the discrepancy in order to deter fraudulent activity. any funds removed from the account will subsequently be restored. if your order is void because the shipping addresses do not match, simply re-submit the order on our website using the verified shipping address listed in your paypal account. my account login/register forgot username or password customer support contact us shipping faq request rma privacy statement terms of sale sitemap product support rebates manufacturer support company info letter from the ceo join our newsletter ©copyright 1996-2010 antonline (atlanta network technologies, inc) alanta network technologies, inc is not responsible for typographical or photographical errors.  prices and specifications are subject to change without notice.
