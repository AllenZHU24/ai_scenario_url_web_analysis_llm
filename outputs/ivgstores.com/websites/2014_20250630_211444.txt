guardrails. always use guardrails on both long sides of the upper bunk. if bunk bed will be placed next to a wall, the guardrail that runs the full length of the bed should be placed against the wall to prevent entrapment between the bed and the wall. prohibit horseplay on or under bed(s) and prohibit jumping on the bed. prohibit more than one person on upper bunk. use ladder for entering and leaving upper bunk. maximum total weight is not to exceed 300lbs. on the upper bunk. periodically check and ensure that the guardrail, ladder, and other components are in their proper position, free from damage, and that all connectors are tight. do not use substitute parts. replacement parts, including additional guardrails, may be obtained from our customer service department. use of water or sleep flotation mattresses is prohibited. use of a night light may provide added safety precaution for a child using the upper bunk. strangulation hazard - never attach or hang items to any part of

bicycle safety is of the utmost importance to our cycle vendors, and it should be to you too. that is why we have included the following tips for keeping yourself safe while you ride. wear a helmet. it is strongly advised that a properly fitting bicycle safety helmet be worn at all times when riding your bicycle. obey traffic laws. bicycles are considered a vehicle, so while riding you follow the same laws as you would in a car, including yielding to pedestrians and stopping at red lights and stop signs. ride predictably. while riding, you should not do anything that would surprise or confuse drivers. you should ride in a straight line and with traffic. use hand signal. using proper hand signals when riding your bicycle will help drivers know what to expect. you signal that you wish to make a left turn by hold your left arm straight out. to indicate that you will be making a right turn, hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing up, and your palm facing forward. for signaling coming to a stop hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing down, and your palm facing rearward. keep your distance. whether you are riding on busy street or on secluded bicycle trail, it is always a good decision to keep your distance from cars, pedestrians, and other riders. disclaimer neither ivgstores, llc nor this website are
