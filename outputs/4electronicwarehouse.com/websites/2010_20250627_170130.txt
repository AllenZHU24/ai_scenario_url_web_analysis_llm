numerous public events, online forums and industry rumors put the launch later this summer, probably around the same time as sony’s new bravia line hits stores, or perhaps closer to the fall right before the holiday shopping season ramps up. what formats will the ps3 support? will they do checkerboard so i can use my mitsubishi 3d ready dlp? currently there is no technical information available. it’s hard to say if the ps3 will produce the required checkerboard format, but many people hope the answer is “yes”. but if one considers how many people already own 3d ready tvs that use the checkerboard format, and the ability to update the ps3, it’s probably a fair bet that the unit will support all the formats. why do people have to upgrade tvs and not a newer version of ps3? the playstation gaming system is primarily software based, meaning that software updates and firmware updates keep the machine at the cutting edge of technology. since the machine’s internal components don’t have to be physically changed, you can keep the same ps3 and just run updates. if you already own a 3d ready hdtv you will probably not have to upgrade, but it all depends on how the industry moves. it’s just like the blu-ray vs. hd-dvd battle, only with 3d there may be several formats that survive instead of just one. posted june 15th, 2010 by electronics guru in ps3, 3d tv | no comments » faq about mitsubishi 3d tv & active shutter glasses do you have questions about 3d tv? below are answers to commonly asked questions about 3d ready mitsubishi hdtvs, active shutter glasses, 3d signal types andâ display formats, hdmi requirements and what you need to get the most out of your 3d home theater. read the rest of this entry » posted june 1st, 2010 by electronics guru in 3d glasses, 3d tv, industry news, new products, how-to | 124 comments » faq about boseâ® lifestyleâ® t20, v25, v35 systems boseâ® has launched three new lifestyleâ® systems — the lifestyleâ® t20 home theater system, lifestyleâ® v25 home entertainment system andâ lifestyleâ® v35 home entertainment system – that feature digital 5.1 surround sound (including hd audio), unifyâ¢ technology, adaptiqâ® audio calibration, 6 high-definition (hd) inputs including 4 hdmi, video upscaling and many other impressive features. the new lifestyleâ® systems feature a sleek, low-profile control console with convenient front panel access and either direct/reflectingâ® or jewel cubeâ® speaker arrays. keep reading to find our more details and answers to frequently asked questions (faq) about the newâ lifestyleâ® systems!
