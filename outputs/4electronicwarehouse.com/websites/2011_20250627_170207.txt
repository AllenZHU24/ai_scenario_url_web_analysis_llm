will the playstation 3 (ps3) play 3d (three dimensional) content on a dlp hdtv, such as mitsubishi 3d ready tvs? as of april 22, 2010, sony released update 3.30, which enabled the ps3 to play 3d games. not 3d movies, just games. unfortunately there were no 3d games — at least not full titles, just demos — ready at launch. as of this writing (june 15, 2010) sony has not yet released an update to the ps3′s blu-ray player that will enable it to play 3d blu-ray movies. when is the ps3 3d movie update coming? nobody knows for sure except sony, and they’re not saying anything! numerous public events, online forums and industry rumors put the launch later this summer, probably around the same time as sony’s new bravia line hits stores, or perhaps closer to the fall right before the holiday shopping season ramps up. what formats will the ps3 support? will they do checkerboard so i can use my mitsubishi 3d ready dlp? currently there is no technical information available. it’s hard to say if the ps3 will produce the required checkerboard format, but many people hope the answer is “yes”. but if one considers how many people already own 3d ready tvs that use the checkerboard format, and the ability to update the ps3, it’s probably a fair bet that the unit will support all the formats. why do people have to upgrade tvs and not a newer version of ps3? the playstation gaming system is primarily software based, meaning that software updates and firmware updates keep the machine at the cutting edge of technology. since the machine’s internal components don’t have to be physically changed, you can keep the same ps3 and just run updates. if you already own a 3d ready hdtv you will probably not have to upgrade, but it all depends on how the industry moves. it’s just like the blu-ray vs. hd-dvd battle, only with 3d there may be several formats that survive instead of just one. posted june 15th, 2010 by electronics guru in 3d tv, ps3 | no comments » « previous entries your electronic warehouse blog by the electronics guru is proudly powered by wordpress entries (rss) and comments (rss). more... phone 1-866-224-6171 customer service hours mon-wed: 8am-8pm cst thu-fri: 8am-7pm cst saturday: 9am-5pm cst address your electronic warehouse 2828 broadway st quincy, il 62301 popular products popular categories popular brands yamaha pdx-30 bose in ear headset bose acoustimass 10 bose acoustimass 16 bose acoustimass 5 bose acoustimass 6 bose 321 bose sound dock sounddock bose sounddock portable ipod portable speaker bose in ear headphones monster 1000hd monster 700hd monster 500hd lady gaga headphones monster headphones bose speakers bose acoustimass bose home theater hdmi cable bose headphones yamaha receivers pioneer receivers monster cables home theater installation monster video monster hdmi monster power ipod speakers sherwood receivers bose monster cable niles audio sherwood email sign up! sign up for news and sale notices. be the first to know! first name last name email address all fields required copyright© 1997-2012 your electronic warehouse designated trademarks and brands are the property of their respective owners. about us · blog · customer service · affiliates · privacy statement · mobile site · site map denon limited time price drops - details » buy now and save on boseâ®! - details » boston acoustics subwoofer's - up to 50% off - details » brands  | specials  | service  | order status  | my cart: 0 items | checkout search 1-866-224-6171 tv & video | home theater & audio | headphones | ipod, iphone, ipad accessories | custom installation | home, travel & leisure table 'wordpress.product_categories' doesn't exist
