radios and accessories electric radio control radio transmitter: with the flip of a switch or push of a stick, the transmitter sends the signal to the receiver on the actual rc car. most rc radio transmitters can be programmed and some include a receiver.receiver: this receives the signal from the transmitter and passes it along to the servo.servo: as your "co-pilot," servos direct the steering of the rc car through a number of gears. measured for size, torque, and other specifications, the more powerful the servo, the more expensive it is.batteries: like in everyday use, batteries hold a charge and serve as a power source. for rc cars, you need batteries for transmitters, as well as a battery pack and charger that serves as your fuel tank for electric rc cars. battery packs are measured in milliamp hours.nitro radio control glow plug igniter: this gets the engine started and is removed once the glow plug is hot and when the engine is running.batteries: the primary difference for running nitro is where the batteries are positioned. on electric rc cars, batteries power everything, but in a nitro car or buggy, you need a battery for the on-board receiver and your standalone equipment. while standard disposable aas will work, most opt for a rechargeable receiver battery.nitro fuel: not to be confused with gasoline, this fuel contains nitro methane and other lubricants. it is also flammable, so be careful! also, gasoline should never be used in a nitro engine.at amain.com, you'll find what you need to get started racing rc cars. even if you select a ready to run rc car kit that comes nearly pre-assembled, you may decide down the road to amp up your vehicle with an upgraded jr servo, flex your skills with a programmable transmitter, or just stay true to your game and buy replacements for the same rc parts that came in your kit. for a crazy selection that will leave your competition in the dirt, shop amain.com. resources & support getting started: cars getting started: helis getting started: planes getting started: trucks guide to car/buggy kits protek r/c manuals site map sponsorship requests customer service amain.com vip rewards vip terms and conditions faq: cancelling orders faq: gift vouchers faq: pre order products faq: rewards points faq: wish list knowledge base product notices product returns contact us shopping help international shipping payments accepted privacy notice shipping & returns shipping restrictions company info about us employment store locations terms of use why shop with us? from the ceo blog press releases get connected join us on facebook follow us on twitter tune in on youtube community forums team blog tracks payments accepted: copyright © 2015 amain.com. all rights reserved.all original wording and photographs used on this website are the property of amain.com, and may not be used without prior written consent.
