greeting cards list this year.what our customers are saying... generally satisfied final product was excellent, but i could not give higher rating because it is a bit expensive. in addition, i would prefer more options in terms of order quantities (increments of 25 is too inflexible). february 15,2011 i did it my way this beautiful, high-quality card permitted me to personalize. i changed the front words, and chose a verse from this year's advent readings, and added a family photo to the reverse of the front and added contact info to the back of the card. the card we send friends and family is unique. we have used cards direct for many years; they get better & better; and never, ever have we been disappointed. october 19,2011 premium paper & printing we like really nice cards,
