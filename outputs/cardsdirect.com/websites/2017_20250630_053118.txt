thanks again for your amazing service! mercer transportation- guyton, ga i just received the order i placed for our company christmas cards. this is the first order i have placed with cardsdirect. i am so pleased with our order. the card is beautiful – and different than those in the numerous catalogs i receive. i am very impressed both with the quality of the product and the ease in ordering it. thank you so much! gail- hudson, oh i just received my christmas card order from you. the cards are outstanding! they are better than i was expecting. our company logo is beautiful. and the envelopes are even self-adhesive! i will definitely order from you again. great job! beth- danbury, wi i just wanted to take the time to let you know how happy i have been w/your company and in particular with the support i have received as a relatively new client. you guys get an "a+" in everything i have needed from the quality of the cards to accessibilty to a live person to help me, as well as the courteous response from absolutely everyone i have dealt with. as a professional photographer using your photo cards to sell to my clients, i have special concerns regarding quality of the finished card to special customization to include my logo, etc. here i need to call out james spann in particular who did a great job helping me ensure my logo was placed properly and was in good resolution. he helped me again when the cards i received were cut too short and the edges didn't match up properly. without hesitation he had new ones ordered and overnighted to me. i literally had them the next day and i consider service like that to be above and beyond....and all this in the midst of the busy holiday season. you made me look good to my client who was impressed that i resolved the problem so quickly. on another occaision dawn in the graphic department helped me re-crop a photo to get it exactly as i wanted it. and you yourself helped me tremendously when i asked for extra samples to have a variety of cards to show to my clients. not only did you send me all the samples i requested, but you overnighted them to me and i had them in 2 days. thank you to everyone at cardsdirect for doing such a great job. you all deserve a big pat on the back. i hope to continue to sell more cards and i'm happy to have found a great vendor to work with. lynn– raleigh, nc i'm busy. i'm on my 15th hour of work today. for me to take a few minutes to write a letter like this means something significant happened. kim cooper blew me away with her customer service. she helped me create my card, gave me good advice, helped me save money on shipping, emailed to confirm address details, and over-communicated to me and to her colleagues at cd to ensure my order arrived early and accurately. in this age when service is so bad that i expect things like this to get screwed up, kim is rare and exceptional. i'd encourage you to recognize her in any way possible. she went above and beyond and is the reason why i'll return and spend more with cards direct and why i'll refer others to you. adam– manhattan beach, ca good morning!

we received the invitation/announcement yesterday and they literally brought a tear to my eyes. again, thank you so very much and i will definitely recommend cardsdirect to everyone! annette- houston, tx thank you again for taking such good care of my company. i received my order today and the cards are just beautiful. this is my second time to order our corporate birthday and anniversary cards from you all and i will continue to do so. have a great day.... sue– raytown, mo i’m just writing to let you know that i’m thrilled with the holiday cards i ordered. i’m very particular about my holiday cards. i’ve spent thousands of dollars on cranes pieces (business cards, holiday cards, note cards), because i love the quality of the stationery. i gave your company a chance this year, because i ordered several samples and was impressed with what i saw. i just opened the box (delivered several days before i expected it) and am thrilled with my personalized cards. you’ve done an absolutely beautiful job. excellent paper quality, proofing online and efficient customer service. what more could a customer want? thanks from a very satisfied client. kristine– chicago, il it would be hard to improve your service. i spoke with a rep who was knowledgeable and quickly answered the few questions i had. jack– mills river, nc very user friendly. i like to see what i am purchasing before i purchase it. i loved the tools!

phyllis- woodland hills, ca we recently placed an order for our company holiday cards. i am writing to say thank you to your company and your employee who assisted us on finalizing our proof. needless to say, we had multiple changes and our rep was very helpful (and incredibly patient) in accommodating each of our requests. we greatly appreciate all of his efforts. shondell- new york, ny on behalf of our company i would like to tell you that our thanksgiving cards we recently ordered are the most beautiful ones we have ever chosen for our firm. the detail, color and quality are more than we expected. the ordering process was a breeze and i was shocked at how fast we received them. i have been ordering cards for the firm for the past 5 years and something has always happened with our order and i cringe when it comes time to order again. since we send out a thanksgiving card to our clients rather than a holiday card we find the choices can be somewhat limited. after receiving your catalog and checking out the website i found that cardsdirect has more choices and has some very unique artwork. thank you again for making this a pleasurable experience rather than a headache. jackie caraska- port orchard, wa i just wanted to comment on the wonderful variety of christmas cards available this year. you just get better and better. the card we selected this year reflects our values and says the perfect message to our customers and employees. thank you for listening to comments sent in the past and expanding your inventory. also thank you for the samples we requested. what you see on the internet and catalogs can look quite different in person. we appreciate the opportunity to actually look and feel the actual card that will represent us. janet- edmond, ok i just want to compliment you again on your web site and how you run your business. i came away with the feeling that i received a great value and had no trouble whatsoever navigating the customization of my card. there are so many businesses on the www who would do well to follow your example. your webmaster is truly a professional, and your business methods and philosophy are stellar! i'll be back--that's for sure! christine- hayfork, ca just wanted to let you know that we received our order today, and the cards are beautiful! i appreciate your excellent customer service, and look forward to ordering with you again!
