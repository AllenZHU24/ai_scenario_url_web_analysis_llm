fancy foods, family feasts, holiday parties; eat, drink and be merry! but beware, holiday party pounds can creep up on you rather quickly. there are, however, ways to avoid this added poundage by planning ahead and considering these simple tips when accepting holiday party invitations. 1. eat a little something nutritious before you head out to party. if you are not starving when you arrive, you are far less likely to chow down at the buffet table of tempting holiday treats. 2. sit or stand as far away from the food as possible. put as many people and as much space as you can between you and the goodies. 3. keep your hands otherwise occupied. a diet drink in one hand and your purse in the other will make it more difficult to juggle a plate of christmas cookies. 4. talk, talk, talk! keep your mouth moving by meeting people and enjoying conversation and you won’t have time to stuff it with food! 5. avoid the over consumption of alcohol. this one isn’t just about weight gain, although alcohol is loaded with calories, it is a wise idea everyone should consider! have one drink then switch to something less caloric. you’ll enjoy the party and the day after as well! it is the holidays though so do allow yourself one special treat. you won’t find those holiday bourbon balls at any other time of the year so indulge within reason by popping one or two and you can ignore all those weight loss commercials that pop up in january!

repeat this same process for the box top. for a good fit, under trim the entire bottom card piece about 1/16” so that the top will fit snuggly over it. once you have done one box the process will seem much easier and you will be on your way to creating a wonderful collection of recycled boxes you will enjoy using and sharing. share and enjoy: these icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. posted in business christmas cards, christmas cards, holiday cards on december 4th, 2009 | no comments » « previous entries blog categories baby birth announcements (7) baby shower invitations (5) birthday cards (19) birthday invitations (3) calendar cards (6) cards for a cause (8) cardsdirect (66) business happy birthday cards (11) customer service (4) charity (11) charity holiday cards (20) christmas cards (89) create a postage stamp (1) design of the week (15) earth day cards (5) funny christmas cards (2) graduation announcements (8) graduation invitations (9) greeting card etiquette (48) greeting cards (136) all occasion assortment packs (1) assortment packs (1) birthday assortment packs (1) business anniversary cards (6) business referral cards (3) congratulations cards (5) corporate welcome cards (2) customer appreciation cards (12) easter cards (1) get well (2) retirement cards (1) thanksgiving cards (20) value cards (1) holiday card etiquette (18) holiday cards (104) business christmas cards (19) fine art cards (2) new years cards (4) photo holder cards (3) valentine's day cards (9) holiday postcards (2) invitations (11) holiday invitations (4) party invitations (4) logo greeting cards (2) miscellaneous fun (23) moving announcements (2) patriotic cards (4) photo cards (25) photo holiday cards (25) postage stamps (5) rants (1) recycled cards (31) spanish greeting cards (1) sympathy cards (15) thank you cards (26) graduation thank you cards (5) thinking of you (14) uncategorized (25) feeds subscribe in a reader subscribe to ms card etiquette's blog by email. log in entries rss comments rss © 1999-2008 cardsdirect llc home about us contact us customer service affiliate program site map privacy policy blog gift directory wedding invitations fri, oct 17, 2008 11:05 am
