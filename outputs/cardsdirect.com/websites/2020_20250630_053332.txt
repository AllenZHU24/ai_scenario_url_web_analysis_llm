saying to whom it may concern: i sent an email yesterday (monday) praising cardsdirect.com for their excellent customer service and how wonderful a job patty did helping us resolve a problem that was totally our fault. she mentioned we should get the cards wednesday, our original deadline, but they may come as late as thursday. however, much to my surprise, we received the cards today (tuesday). cardsdirect.com has gone above and beyond what can be reasonably expected from a company and i truly appreciate all the efforts made to ensure we got the product we needed in a timely fashion.tim- san antonio, tx we love the cards we ordered from you for our business! they look great! we know our customers will love how beautiful they are! and they arrived in a week from the time we placed the order! we will be ordering again in the future! your website made designing our cards simple and fast!! thanks again for your amazing service!mercer transportation- guyton, ga i just received the order i placed for our company christmas cards. this is the first order i have placed with cardsdirect. i am so pleased with our order. the card is beautiful – and different than those in the numerous catalogs i receive. i am very impressed both with the quality of the product and the ease in ordering it. thank you so much! gail- hudson, oh i just received my christmas card order from you. the cards are outstanding! they are better than i was expecting. our company logo is beautiful. and the envelopes are even self-adhesive! i will definitely order from you again. great job!beth- danbury, wi i just wanted to take the time to let you know how happy i have been w/your company and in particular with the support i have received as a relatively new client. you guys get an "a+" in everything i have needed from the quality of the cards to accessibilty to a live person to help me, as well as the courteous response from absolutely everyone i have dealt with. as a professional photographer using your photo cards to sell to my clients, i have special concerns regarding quality of the finished card to special customization to include my logo, etc. here i need to call out james spann in particular who did a great job helping me ensure my logo was placed properly and was in good resolution. he helped me again when the cards i received were cut too short and the edges didn't match up properly. without hesitation he had new ones ordered and overnighted to me. i literally had them the next day and i consider service like that to be above and beyond....and all this in the midst of the busy holiday season. you made me look good to my client who was impressed that i resolved the problem so quickly. on another occaision dawn in the graphic department helped me re-crop a photo to get it exactly as i wanted it. and you yourself helped me tremendously when i asked for extra samples to have a variety of cards to show to my clients. not only did you send me all the samples i requested, but you overnighted them to me and i had them in 2 days. thank you to everyone at cardsdirect for doing such a great job. you all deserve a big pat on the back. i hope to continue to sell more cards and i'm happy to have found a great vendor to work with.lynn– raleigh, nc i'm busy. i'm on my 15th hour of work today. for me to take a few minutes to write a letter like this means something significant happened. kim cooper blew me away with her customer service. she helped me create my card, gave me good advice, helped me save money on shipping, emailed to confirm address details, and over-communicated to me and to her colleagues at cd to ensure my order arrived early and accurately. in this age when service is so bad that i expect things like this to get screwed up, kim is rare and exceptional. i'd encourage you to recognize her in any way possible. she went above and beyond and is the reason why i'll return and spend more with cards direct and why i'll refer others to you. adam– manhattan beach, ca good morning!i just received my order and you and your team are absolutely fabulous!!! thank you…thank you…thank you!!! your customer service people and the quality of your work is superb!!! i am forever a customer of cardsdirect.com!you guys rock!gracias! nicole– manassas, va please pass this e-mail to your management team. this letter is a "wow! thank you." working with your site is extremely easy. there were some revisions needed, and it was easy to set them up in your web based system. i imagine that a human must still work with it – but, still, you have figured out a way of minimizing the customer-staff interactions... i really appreciate this kind of service.scott– simi valley, ca i do not order online much because i have had bad experiences with it. this is by far the best online business experience i have encountered. thank you! you are very helpful. i will remember this wonderful experience with you and your company for years to come!! thank you again!heidi– clarksville, ga i received my cards today, thank you so much, they turned out great, i am very happy with them and will tell everyone to order from you, it was fast and easy. thank you again.alisa– quincy, ca just a note to say thank you. i work in the quality field and know that many times the customer is quick to respond and criticize when things have gone wrong so here's to you for doing it right. i was apprehensive about ordering cards online and was worried about receiving a lack luster product. i was wrong on both accounts. you made the process of ordering easy and efficient and the card was of good stock " quality. i googled for 'new years calendar cards and found your site. the better business bureau confirmed that you had a good rating so i decided to take a chance. the new year calendar cards (b1659 - swatches of the seasons calendar card) i ordered in december came in a timely fashion without any lengthy delay / problem and were well received. i received numerous compliments on the design and graphics of the card and as i walk around my office i see that many have their calendars posted for continued enjoyment throughout the year.thanks again from a satisfied customer.shannon– philadelphia, pa i just wanted to thank you for the beautiful graduation invitation you created for my son and for the fantastic customer service you provide. the announcement i was going to use had been discontinued the week before. your live customer chat found it for me and posted it on line so that i could order it. i placed the order at 8:00 p.m. on wednesday and received notification on saturday that the cards had shipped. i could not believe it! we received the invitation/announcement yesterday and they literally brought a tear to my eyes. again, thank you so very much and i will definitely recommend cardsdirect to everyone!annette- houston, tx thank you again for taking such good care of my company. i received my order today and the cards are just beautiful. this is my second time to order our corporate birthday and anniversary cards from you all and i will continue to do so. have a great day....sue– raytown, mo i’m just writing to let you know that i’m thrilled with the holiday cards i ordered. i’m very particular about my holiday cards. i’ve spent thousands of dollars on cranes pieces (business cards, holiday cards, note cards), because i love the quality of the stationery. i gave your company a chance this year, because i ordered several samples and was impressed with what i saw. i just opened the box (delivered several days before i expected it) and am thrilled with my personalized cards. you’ve done an absolutely beautiful job. excellent paper quality, proofing online and efficient customer service. what more could a customer want? thanks from a very satisfied client.kristine– chicago, il it would be hard to improve your service. i spoke with a rep who was knowledgeable and quickly answered the few questions i had.jack– mills river, nc very user friendly. i like to see what i am purchasing before i purchase it. i loved the tools!chasidy– huntsville, al i loved the ease of placing the personalized order.gail– jackson, ga i received the cards last friday. they are absolutely gorgeous! please thank everyone involved in this process. i was very impressed with the quality and speediness of the ordering process and will definitely be using this company again! thank you! katie– rochester, mn i followed through and ordered from the sample. it is definitely helpful being able to see and feel the product ahead of time. the speedy follow through was excellent and the phone support was great as well. i don't order very much through the internet because of all the horror stories. my experience with your company was excellent.karen– phoenix, az i wanted to comment on my recent order of moving announcements from your company. the ordering process was super easy and my custom cards arrived very quickly. i am so thrilled with the end product! they are very well done, printed on heavy paper, and look beautiful. i cannot wait to let family and friends know of our upcoming move with these adorable announcements. thank you for offering great products at a great price. i will definitely recommend your company and return again for future card needs.martha– aubrey, tx i recently purchased a birthday card assortment and a box of referral cards. i decided to try using your cards to assist in maintaining business contacts. i only ordered a few as i wanted to see the quality. needless to say, i was very pleased and ordered some additional cards. i am a professional photographer and the idea that i could easily get my photos printed on cards was very exciting. naturally, the next "sample" i ordered was a box of photo cards. the process was very easy and, of course, i was again pleased with the quality. however, that's not why i'm writing you. i wanted to share that i have actually received phone calls complimenting me on the cards themselves. people love the quality, the custom printing and the originality of the photo card. thank you for making my job easier. kelly– leonardo, nj you guys are the best! i ordered my business and personal cards from you last year and was thrilled! this order is for my parents as i helped them make their card. i will soon be ordering my personal and business christmas cards with you as well as soon as i get my pictures in. what great customer service you have and an exceptional product!!! jessica-- holden, me

milwaukee, wi wow! i honestly didn't expect this to be handled. you know the routine...send an email and never get a response. thank you for the wonderful service! cardsdirect rocks! kathy- de pere, wi you people are so screwed up. my order arrived two days before it was supposed to and now my whole week's careful planning is thrown off :-) seriously, i am so impressed with you. this order was uploaded on the 12th; a proof was returned to me the same day; and now the cards have arrived on the 16th. and the quality is, as it was last year, excellent. i hope you benefit from your professionalism. ralph- cherry hill, nj i cannot thank you enough for everything that you have done to make my christmas cards wonderful. it has been a pleasure to talk to actual people and i will

representative that i have ever worked with and your supervisor needs to know how refreshing and wonderful it is to work with someone that actually understands the meaning of customer service. michelle- virginia beach, va absolutely fantastic! i have never ordered an online digital card. they were perfect, and absolutely beautiful! i could not even believe it when they arrived as quickly as they did. they were half the price of my usual cards! i will be back, and will spread the word! patty- cleveland heights, oh i just wanted to compliment your customer service, professionalism, and efficiency when assisting me with my holiday card order this year. your follow-up and timely replies to my emails and concerns were much appreciated. tiffany- ronkonkoma, ny i was helping one of our administrative assistants at her desk today and noticed a box full of corporate christmas cards with a big gold “cardsdirect” sticker on top of it. she had some really nice things to say about your business. she said the quality of the cards was outstanding, especially for the price, and that your website is really easy to use and really gives you a good idea of what you’re getting without having to mess with samples. just wanted to pass this along! andy- dallas, tx i just received my cards in the mail and wanted to tell you how beautiful they are. i am pleased with the quality of the cards, but also with the professional assistance i received during the placement of my order and proof approval. well done. you can be sure we will be ordering again!sarah- mequon, wi i just wanted to let you know we received all 3 orders and the cards look great. thanks for all your help... and we look forward to ordering again from cards direct next year. keep up the good work! phyllis- woodland hills, ca we recently placed an order for our company holiday cards. i am writing to say thank you to your company and your employee who assisted us on finalizing our proof. needless to say, we had multiple changes and our rep was very helpful (and incredibly patient) in accommodating each of our requests. we greatly appreciate all of his efforts. shondell- new york, ny on behalf of our company i would like to tell you that our thanksgiving cards we recently ordered are the most beautiful ones we have ever chosen for our firm. the detail, color and quality are more than we expected. the ordering process was a breeze and i was shocked at how fast we received them. i have been ordering cards for the firm for the past 5 years and something has always happened with our order and i cringe when it comes time to order again. since we send out a thanksgiving card to our clients rather than a holiday card we find the choices can be somewhat limited. after receiving your catalog and checking out the website i found that cardsdirect has more choices and has some very unique artwork. thank you again for making this a pleasurable experience rather than a headache. jackie caraska- port orchard, wa i just wanted to comment on the wonderful variety of christmas cards available this year. you just get better and better. the card we selected this year reflects our values and says the perfect message to our customers and employees. thank you for listening to comments sent in the past and expanding your inventory. also thank you for the samples we requested. what you see on the internet and catalogs can look quite different in person. we appreciate the opportunity to actually look and feel the actual card that will represent us. janet- edmond, ok i just want to compliment you again on your web site and how you run your business. i came away with the feeling that i received a great value and had no trouble whatsoever navigating the customization of my card. there are so many businesses on the www who would do well to follow your example. your webmaster is truly a professional, and your business methods and philosophy are stellar! i'll be back--that's for sure! christine- hayfork, ca just wanted to let you know that we received our order today, and the cards are beautiful! i appreciate your excellent customer service, and look forward to ordering with you
