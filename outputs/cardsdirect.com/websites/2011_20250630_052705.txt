christmas cards photo calendar cards post cards see all what our customers are saying... excellent job i uploaded my own artwork for my christmas cards, and cards direct reproduced it beautifully. i was able to upload my own italic writing for the message and select from a large number of fonts for the back of the card. the cards were delivered promptly as well. i will definitely use cards direct for my card needs in the future. november 10,2010 great custom job thank you for a job well done! march 16,2011 another good order this was my second order from cards direct. i needed a simple thank you card. a picture with the words 'thank you' underneath was all i was looking for. being allowed to customized, i rotated the card vertically, added a photo of my puppy, and edited the text underneath to read 'thank you'. when i received the product, it was exactly as i had hoped. september 10,2011 solid product the card was easy to design and turned out very well. very professional. production time was in line with estimates and delivery was good. i use cardsdirect for all of my corporate card needs. march 16,2011 premium paper & printing we like really nice cards, it's just that
