enclosures. a server rack is simply the framework upon which network equipment is mounted. enclosures are racks fitted with side panels and front and rear doors. to "enclose" them, if you will. so which is better? it depends on your needs. advantages of open racks advantages of enclosures open racks are more affordable, provide easier access to equipment for maintenance, and are easier to keep cool. if you choose an open rack, be sure to keep your server room secure to prevent possible intrusion and vandalism. on the other hand, the advantage of the network enclosure is security. virtually all modern floor, wall, and ceiling enclosures feature keyed entry, locking out unauthorized personnel to prevent tampering. side panels and doors are constructed of heavy cold rolled steel to prevent impact damage. for heat sensitive or otherwise critical equipment, we offer thermal enclosures. mounting options but what about your mounting options? floor mounting will bring the highest level of efficiency when it comes to installing servers and other pieces of network equipment. because of very high load capacities, floor enclosures will generally be able to handle anything you need to install up to its space capacity. wall enclosures are often used to isolate certain groups of related equipment for more convenient access. wall mounting is also a great solution for preventing auxiliary equipment from taking up too much precious real estate in your floor enclosure. floor enclosure wall mount enclosure uses outside the server room installing servers and network equipment is certainly not the "end-all be-all" of rack mounting. the 19" model is also used for mobile music equipment setups, home theaters, and test equipment, among other uses. we offer all types of rack mounting solutions, so please browse our full selection to find the most fitting product for your application. finding the most practical rack or enclosure for your needs racks and enclosures help keep your network equipment organized and accessible. there are a lot of options to choose from which can make buying the right one a bit overwhelming. as always, at cableorganizer.com we are here to help and to clarify how to figure out what best suits your specific needs. rack vs. enclosure first of all, let's begin with the difference between a rack and an enclosure. simply put, a rack is just a rack for the cable system for your server network - with nothing to conceal it. it works great for industrial spaces where you don't mind seeing your wiring. it is also especially useful for cables that need to be accessed frequently as it provides a balance of organization and accessibility. an enclosure has a rack within it, but just as the name suggests, it is closed off and concealed for a neat look. it is great for home theater systems or office spaces where you need your network components organized but out of sight. additionally, the enclosed space provides an extra layer of safety and security to ensure your system stay in great shape. rack and enclosure options to consider once you figure out if a rack or enclosure best suits your needs, there are still a number of options to weed through until you find the best fit. one of the first things to consider is where you are going to put your network equipment. do you want it on the floor? on the wall? perhaps even mounted to the ceiling? all of these are viable options and we have models that can be mounted just about anywhere. additionally, it is important to think about security. when the wrong people mess with server networks they aren't familiar with, bad things can happen. from disconnecting the wrong cable, to getting an unforgiving electrical shock, to savings your system from wear and tear - sometimes you need to keep them off limits. for that reason, we offer a number of secure lock boxes to make sure your cables keep running smoothly and out of the wrong hands. useful items to purchase with your rack or enclosure purchasing a rack or enclosure is a great step towards organization and safety, but you shouldn't stop there. a number of tools exist to organize your system even better. remember, the more time you invest in the beginning to keep things organized, the easier each visit to your rack or enclosure will be in the future. for starters, cable identification tags are a great way to ensure you can identify a wire with just a glance. different options exist, like colored icons to identify voice and data, and labels that you can customize for more extensive and complicated jobs. it is also useful to purchase ties for your cables so that you can keep things neatly bundled together in one place. there are plenty of accessories to consider also. keeping wires well-ventilated is always important. think about where your cables will be, and if additional cooling and venting is necessary, we have plenty of cooling solutions designed to do just that. when designing your rack or enclosure, think about completely customizing it to fit your needs. with all the options that are available to you, there is no need to try to fit your entire network into a system that isn't perfect. instead, look at the options and design your own custom space. need additional shelves or drawers? we have them! same with all the equipment and accessories you will need, down to the smallest details. cableorganizer.com is proud to be a one-stop-shop where you can get everything you need for your cable rack or enclosure, from a-z and everything in between! shop. learn. save time. get
