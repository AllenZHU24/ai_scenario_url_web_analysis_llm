accurate order turnaround is one of our top priorities  after all, no one likes to wait! when you place an order with us, you can be confident that were doing everything we can to get your products on their way as quickly as possible, via some of the safest, most reliable carriers in the industry. shipping methods for standard orders, we ship via ups and the united states postal service (usps). in most cases, at checkout you’ll be given the option to select which carrier, cost and speed of delivery works best for you. for large items that require lift gate service or other special handling, delivery will be made by a specialized freight carrier. shipping costs shipping costs are automatically calculated in your online shopping cart, and are based on the size and weight of your items, their destination, and which shipping method you choose. our shipping rates are quoted to you directly from real time ups and usps shipping calculators, and include a small handling fee. cableorganizer.com does not make a profit from shipping costs, and we do everything we can to keep them as low as possible. if you ever feel that a quoted shipping rate seems extravagantly high for the products you’re ordering, please feel free to contact us toll-free at 866-222-0030, and we’ll be happy to double check it for accuracy. how fast will my order ship? items that are in stock and sent directly from our warehouse will ship in 24 to 48 hours. in most cases, if you place an order before 2:00pm et and the requested item(s) are in stock, it will leave our warehouse the same day. if an item you order needs to be drop-shipped from one of our vendors, we’ll make sure that they ship it out within 2 business days. if you’re on a tight deadline and need same day shipping, please don’t hesitate to ask – we’ll do our absolute best to accommodate you. shipment confirmation and tracking when your order ships, we’ll send you a confirmation e-mail, complete with estimated delivery date and tracking information (if you selected a trackable shipping method). orders shipped ups always include signature tracking, and first class, priority and express mail have delivery confirmation. if your order is being shipped internationally, please keep in mind that tracking beyond the united states is only available through ups. will i need to sign for my delivery? if your order ships via ups, someone will need sign for it upon delivery, as we always use signature tracking to ensure that your shipment arrives safely. orders sent via usps include delivery confirmation, but they generally don’t require a signature. international shipping need to have an order shipped internationally? no problem! we’re able to ship product around the world via both ups and usps. please keep in mind that when you place an international order, you are responsible for all applicable duty and taxes, and that international order tracking is available only through ups. view our complete international shipping policy hazardous materials shipping please note that some of the products available at cableorganizer.com are designated “orm-d,” meaning that the faa classifies them as potentially hazardous materials because they’re liquids, have a particular chemical content, or are packaged in pressurized containers. due to federal regulations, orm-d items can only be shipped ground, and can’t be sent beyond the 48 contiguous united states. package guarantees in the unlikely situation that your shipment doesn’t arrive at its destination, we’re happy to issue replacement items, but we can only do so for orders with tracking numbers. packages issued without tracking numbers become untraceable after leaving our facility, so they cannot be guaranteed. for your convenience and protection, we highly recommend choosing a trackable shipping method (ups). special shipping needs if you’d like order tracking, signature confirmation, insurance or other special shipping considerations that may not be automatically included with your chosen shipping method, please leave us a note in the “comment” field during checkout, or call us directly to make a request. we’ll do everything we can to accommodate you! *in the event that your chosen shipping method isn’t available at the time of shipment, we’ll send your order via the closest comparable option, at no additional cost to you. have additional
