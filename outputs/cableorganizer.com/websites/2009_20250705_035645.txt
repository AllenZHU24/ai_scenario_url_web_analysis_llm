satisfaction guaranteed return policy our friendly 1 year return policy here at cableorganizer.com, we promise to do our very best at bringing you the highest quality products in a timely and efficient manner. however, if for some reason you need to return your order, we will gladly issue you a refund, according to the following guidelines: **all returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee. serial number and certification labels (e.g. ul listing, capacity, brand name, upc code, etc.) must not be removed or altered, as this will void your cableorganizer.com return policy. all returns must be processed within 1 year from the invoice date, whether you’re requesting a refund or a replacement. any products marked “non-cancellable/non-returnable” are not eligible for return. this includes all generators and their accessories. any custom/made to order products are also considered “non-cancellable/non-returnable” as well. examples of these products are: custom cut pieces of heat shrink, braided sleeving, or wire loom; made to order products like power data centers, power floor, and cable trays. manufacturer restrictions cableorganizer.com works with an array of manufacturers to bring you the best product selection on the market. products that ship directly from their manufacturing facility are called drop ship items, which fall under this category. some manufacturers have a standard 25% restocking fee that must be applied to all items returned within 30 calendar days; the only cases in which this policy wouldn’t apply is if the product had been delivered defective, or a mistake was made on our part. all returns must be in original packaging and resalable condition in order to qualify for credit. out-of-stock/backordered/discontinued items if you wish to return an item that has been discontinued, you will be given the option of accepting a comparable replacement item, or receiving a refund at the current market value of the product, less the restocking fee. any current marker value refund issued may not exceed the original invoice price. in the event that the item you ordered is either out of stock or backordered a representative will contact you to request an alternative item. defective product/incorrect product please call us for a rma so we may arrange for a return for the defective/incorrect item and replace it at no cost to you. the item must include its original packaging, and be in as-new condition with the packing slip, all warranty cards, and accessories (if applicable). please allow approximately 5 business days for your return to be processed once it has arrived at the warehouse. ordered the wrong size or color? if you would like an exchange for an order you placed, please call us for a rma number.  if you request a replacement, we will ship it after we receive and process your returned product. if you need a replacement right away, we suggest you request a credit (rather than a replacement), when you obtain your rma number. then, place a new order. the new order will be shipped as soon as we have the product available and a credit will be applied approximately 7 days after we receive the product(s) you are returning in their original condition within 90 days. damaged items will not be refunded if they are in non-resellable condition. we recommend you insure your package. shipping charges we know that we are not always perfect; at times we may send you an incorrect item or defective product – in this instance, and we will gladly facilitate the return and replacement of the product and cover any applicable shipping charges. unfortunately, we are unable to issue shipping refunds on items returned under any other circumstances. products sold by the foot due to the nature of the materials, we cannot provide full refunds on braided sleeving, wire loom, and heat shrink tubing sold by the foot if they have been cut into sections of 20 feet or less; however, we will make exception and provide a full refund in the event that we make an error. if you return a section measuring less than 20 feet, a 50% restocking fee will apply, unless you request a replacement. if a replacement order is made, the restocking fee will be reduced to 25%. returns on sections larger than 20 feet will be accepted. how to process a return check your package all returns must be in their original packaging, as well as in resalable condition. any packaging materials, cds, software, accessories, manuals, warranty cards and documentation originally sent must be included in the package. in the event that a package is returned and does not meet the guidelines we’ve listed above, cableorganizer.com reserves the right not to honor the return. contact us for a return merchandise authorization in order to process our
