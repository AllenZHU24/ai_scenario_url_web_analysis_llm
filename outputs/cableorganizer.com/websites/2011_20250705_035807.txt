all started back in february 2002, when valerie holstein and her husband, paul, invested $30 into registering a web domain, and began operating cableorganizer.com from their home garage. frustrated by the unruly cables around their computers and home theater system, they set out to offer simple but effective products that would help others organize the cord clutter in their homes and offices. it turns out that they found a niche, and in the passing years they've not only expanded the company's product line to include electrical supplies, network products, home theater components, tools and testers, but also grown out of their garage and into 38,000 square feet of warehouse space in fort lauderdale, florida. cableorganizer.com has become the one-stop shop that over 250,000 customers worldwide rely upon for over 42,000 products, comprehensive consumer resources, fast order turnaround, and stellar customer service. why we're different: customer satisfaction is our first priority. we pride ourselves on the fact that anyone can dial our toll-free number 24/7/365, and be greeted by a live person on the other end of the line. our customer service representatives are second to none; they're expertly trained on the products we offer, and you'll find that they're also unfailingly friendly and accommodating, even to the point of referring a customer to one of our competitors if we can't give that person what they need within the time frame he or she requires. as one of our representatives recently said, "if you need it, we've got it… if not, we'll get it!" cableorganizer.com is a gsa-certified woman owned business, and thanks to our extensive product line and unsurpassed service, we've had the honor of supplying an impressive lineup of well-respected organizations, which includes nasa, boeing, hewlett packard, microsoft, lucent, pfizer, walmart, kodak, lockheed martin, wells fargo, and many others. who we are: still led by co-founders valerie holstein (president and ceo) and paul holstein (vice president and coo), cableorganizer.com is powered by a diverse group of executives, it experts, marketing professionals, web designers, product specialists, customers service representatives and logistics personnel from all over the world. in addition to our headquarters in beautiful south florida, we also operate a subsidiary, cableorganizer france (http://cableorganizer.fr) out of rennes, france. » view press room » view news coverage received product line: wire loom braided sleeving cord covers heat shrink tubing raceway, duct & conduit
