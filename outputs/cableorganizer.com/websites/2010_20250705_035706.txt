phone call apologizing that the picture was not accurate and that new digital pictures would be added to the website. also, i was given an option to receive my $ back or to pick a color that may be better, which worked perfectly. and, although i offered to still return the first item, was informed to keep it. excellent customer service - i am impressed!  dsgrove city, oh    united states date

updates. yes we had some very bad storms. but i would like to say im very impressed with you company. also thank you for the updates. i know you probably didnt have to do it. i felt like you and your company went the extra mile to keep me informed. the other company we dealt with is far less customer orientated. their customer service is very rude, plus they have never sent emails or have checked up on customer orders. let alone to send a email out about the weather and how things are going. i will be using your company from now on when we need some thing. customer satisfaction is the key for companys staying in business. keep up the excellent work and the exceptional customer service. thank you so much for doing a great job sincerely,  jeffrey hebertsfw airport, tx    united

i'm referring to this page: http://cableorganizer.com/geotarget/canada.htm?src=0512z2can usually you have to dig around in a bunch of pages, faq's etc until you finally figure out "ok bummer they don't ship to canada". but yours has a nice little note to welcome and guide us, so thank you, it's very thoughtful ;-) not only that, but you even have a french translation too for us french canadians (of which i'm a proud member). this is rare, even on canadian websites!! i haven't made my purchase yet, but you have great products. i'm both a musician and an it technician and i deal a lot with cables, so you can be sure i am going to buy some of your products. merci (thanks)!!  bruno d.unknown    canada date posted:  05-27-2008we have never purchases product from your company, but will refer others. your company website is very easy to use and your prices are great.  sj smithpompano beach, fl    united states date posted:  05-13-2008hi! i had some difficulties with the shipment of a package i ordered from cableorganizer.com. it was not your fault, but usps; they didnt give me a shipping/tracking number, so i didnt know where the package was located after it left you.. beginning to worry, i sent a mail to your support, and a nice fellow named shaun answered. he understood my worries, but gave me good advice, and told me to wait a little bit more to see if the package arrived. and it did. this saturday (10.may) it arrived in my post office in norway. during the time between when my order was placed, until it arrived here in norway, i have had a extremely positive experience with cableorganizer.com, and i really appreciated the personal touch shaun gave when answering my mail. it was not like there was a machine or some "standard" answers (like when i tried to e-mail usps......). it felt good knowing that there actually was a person who was concerned about the problems that might had occurred. due to your professional and excellent customer service, i will recommend cableorganizer.com to all my friends and fellow workmates, and i personally will continue using cableorganizer.com in the future. thanks from a happy and satisfied customer! :-)  dan steinbakktromsø    norway date posted:  05-07-2008thank you for this email and information. so often after placing an order, we are left in the dark as to its progress and location. i very much appreciate this "customer care" and i will be a repeat customer!  john hulburtandover, oh    united states date posted:  04-24-2008order received today, everything as expected mr ribero thanks for your help.i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate the great service during problems with my purchase several weeks ago servicio muy bueno serios david g.j.  david canaryislands spain    spain date posted:  02-04-2008i am a marine currently deployed to iraq in support of operation iraqi freedom, and recently made a purchase on your website. i am writing to you to inform you that my dealings with your company (first time) and more importantly with your personnel, specifically shaun berg, were above and beyond any level of customer service that have experienced recently. if you read the email chain, you will understand why i would like to bring the actions of your employee to your attention. besides "saving the sale" (at one point you'll notice that i was fine with cancelling the order), shaun was pleasant, proactive, and had no problem taking the extra step to ensure that i was satisfied and taken care of. please ensure that shaun receives the appropriate commendatory recognition that your company would normally provide for service of such caliber, and rest assured that i will consider cableorganizer.com my first source of products from now on, and recommend without hesitation your products and services to my friends and colleagues. thank you,  wes krohn-    iraq date posted:  01-14-2008i was very impressed by their customer service. i had accidently ordered the wrong cables, but the cs took care of it without any hassles. response time was excellent and their cs was very friendly and helpful. paeyankton, sd    united states date posted:  01-11-2008i am very impressed with your efficiency in filling my order and the corteous phone notification from customer service that a few items were on back order. thank you, - michael  michael claggettsante fe, nm    united states date posted:  09-12-2007hi fernando, no need to apologize. i totally understand that this is not the fault of yourself or your company but is down to the incompetence of the postal service. i am stunned that you are prepared to ship out a new order when this is clearly not your fault. this has to be the best customer service in the world! if the original parcel should be delivered to me, please trust that i will return it to you immediately. once again, i am utterly amazed at your kindness and understanding and i cannot thank you enough. regards,  jamie date posted:  09-12-2007i was very impressed with this cable organizer! i had doubts about it being able to organize my mess, but it did! i could also easily cut it to spit it in two! i had a problem with the shipping, somehow the package was delivered to the wrong address which was the usps company's fault, but the cable organizer company worked with me and told me i could pick up another one if i didn't get the original one! that is what i call customer service. fortunately, i found the package at my neighbor's apt; but its was good to know they would've replaced it if it got lost! great service!  julio z.fort lauderdale, fl    united states date posted:  09-12-2007order received today, everything as expected. thanks for taking the time to call about the backordered item. i am very pleased with this transaction and highly recommend cableorganizer.com. i will be sure to let all my "modding" friends know about you.take care.  k. vaughn date posted:  09-12-2007i just received the spool from fed-ex. thanks again for your help and follow-ups. it is perfect for what we need.thanks again.  b. fried - brevard community college date posted:  09-12-2007maintaining both a large fleet of vehicles and an interagency computer network is a constant challenge. i was very impressed with the service and speed of delivery that we received from cableorganizer.com. the sales person was polite, efficient and followed up with us both before and after the sale. i would definitely feel comfortable ordering from cableorganizer.comin the future for both my professional and personal needs.  t. bradycherry hill, nj    united states date posted:  09-12-2007your web site is easy to use and your service is fantastic. my order arrived quickly and in perfect condition. thank you.  j. winfieldportland, or    united states date posted:  09-12-2007i want you to know how impressed i was with rafael's assistance and resolution of a problem with a defective product from a previous order. this was the main factor in my decision to give you my further business and order these tapes from you. i have found vendors that may be $1 or 2 cheaper on each cassette, but the excellent service you provide and standing behind your product so well it is worth a little extra to me. keep up the good work and thanks again. it is a pleasant surprise these days to find a company that offers such good customer service. we are a small emergency services consulting company that does some hardware installation work from time to time. we do not go through a lot of volume on these supplies, but i assure you your website will be my first stop whenever we do need something.  k. davidson date posted:  09-12-2007i received my order over the weekend; thanks for a great product and a pleasant transaction.you guys look like you do a great job, congrats!  e. lee date posted:  09-12-2007mark, just wanted to write and say thanks for the outstanding service you provided me on the phone. honestly, i could "hear" your smile in your conversation!

the cheap spongy adhesive on their backs would not hold at all. then i ordered yours, thinking that someone in the business of securing stuff would make a quality product. it has now been over a week and even under load, the cable clips i got from you are holding fantastically!
