i had doubts about it being able to organize my mess, but it did! i could also easily cut it to split it in two! i had a problem with the shipping, somehow the package was delivered to the wrong address which was the usps company's fault, but the cable organizer company worked with me and told me i could pick up another one if i didn't get the original one! that is what i call customer service. fortunately, i found the package at my neighbor's apartment, but its was good to know they would've replaced it if it got lost! great service!  julio z.fort lauderdale, florida    united states date posted:  09-12-2007hi fernando, no need to apologize. i totally understand that this is not the fault of yourself or your company but is down to the incompetence of the postal service. i am stunned that you are prepared to ship out a new order when this is clearly not your fault. this has to be the best customer service in the world! if the original parcel should be delivered to me, please trust that i will return it to you immediately. once again, i am utterly amazed at your kindness and understanding and i cannot thank you enough. regards,  jamie date posted:  01-11-2008i am very impressed with your efficiency in filling my order, and the courteous phone notification from customer service that a few items were on backorder. thank you, - michael  michael claggettsante fe, new mexico    united states date posted:  07-23-2008i am very pleased with the service given by www.cableorganizer.com. i recommend this sight to everyone. one, because of their fast service, reliability and new products!

i had some difficulties with the shipment of a package i ordered from cableorganizer.com. it was not your fault, but usps's; they didn�t give me a shipping/tracking number, so i didn�t know where the package was located after it left you. beginning to worry, i sent an e-mail to your support, and a nice fellow named shaun answered. he understood my worries, but gave me good advice, and told me to wait a little bit more to see if the package arrived. and it did. this saturday (may 10th) it arrived at my post office in norway. during the time between when my order was placed, until it arrived here in norway, i have had an extremely positive experience with cableorganizer.com, and i really appreciated the personal touch shaun gave when answering my mail. it was not like there was a machine or some "standard" answers (like when i tried to e-mail usps......). it felt good knowing that there actually was a person who was concerned about the problems that might have occurred. due to your professional and excellent customer service, i will recommend cableorganizer.com to all my friends and fellow workmates, and i personally will continue using cableorganizer.com in the future. thanks from a happy and satisfied customer!

i'm referring to this page: http://cableorganizer.com/geotarget/canada.htm?src=0512z2can usually, you have to dig around in a bunch of pages, faqs, etc until you finally figure out "ok, bummer, they don't ship to canada." but yours has a nice little note to welcome and guide us, so thank you, it's very thoughtful ;-) not only that, but you even have a french translation, too, for us french canadians (of which i'm a proud member). this is rare, even on canadian websites!!

the seven foot white wire loom was exactly what i needed. i have pictures showing how messy the wires were before and then how neat it looks after installation.  l. braginwesthampton, new york    united states date posted:  09-12-2007excellent. i wanted to comment on what a great site you have as well. besides good pricing (always a plus) the interface is intuitive, and very educational as well. it is good to see companies like yours making web content much easier to navigate and use for purchase comparison. i have to tell you the ease of use, and the thorough explanation of benefits for the products is what made the sale for me. i look forward to doing plenty of business with you guys in the future.  e. alderman date posted:  09-12-2007i was very happy with my order from cableorganizer.com the ordering process was quick secure and convenient, i received my order in about 3 days and i am very pleased with the quality of the product. i would recommend cableorganizer.com to anyone with cable organizing needs.  e. sherwood date posted:  09-12-2007i found exactly what i was looking for from cableorganizer.com after several attempts to find the same thing in stores specializing in organizing. the online experience was so easy and convenient but mostly the cable organizing product was great. it's really nice to be able to do online and find the perfect item.  sandra b.new york city, new york    united states date posted:  09-12-2007this is my second order!

(how about a brown color for use with wood desks.) suggestion: because the sleeving opens fairly easily, do not use with wires whose termination points are spaced far apart. this will cause the wires to spill out of the sleeving.  steven lesserboston, massachusetts    united states date posted:  09-02-2011i can always find that hard to get items. thanks for a great products..  deemagnolia, texas    united states here's what our customers have to say about our fast service date posted:  09-12-2007wow, what incredible service !!

its adaptability. for instance, we have to run many cords to one multiple outlet. right in the middle of the room, i have a hepa filter air cleaner. i set the machine right next to the organizer and just threaded the cord in at the middle. what a nice product.thanks for your help.  l. brownsan francisco, california    united states date posted:  09-12-2007cableorganizer.com was in supply of what

and that it answered my prayers beautifully. i just purchased a new range rover and had mounted my cell phone and radar detector where i wanted them to be. the problem -- how to organize and lead the cables from the power source (cigar lighter) to the designated position of each unit? i tried clips from my local hardware store and from radio shack. all seemed fine until about three hours later when all the clips let go! the cheap spongy adhesive on their backs would not hold at all. then i ordered yours, thinking that someone in the business of securing stuff would make a quality product. it has now been over a week and even under load, the cable clips i got from you are holding fantastically! i will certainly recommend you to my friends who have the same problem.regards,  j.
