reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 4 months ago i own a fair share of tnf gear and clothing, and admittedly am a bit of a fanboy. if there was someone who wanted to debate their quality/value ratio then i would pair them up with what i feel imho is the company's "knock'em dead line up". one is the denali fleece jacket (first iteration); second are any size of the base camp duffel series, and finally this hoodie. it is hands down the most comfortable piece of clothing i own, not to mention it pairs well in any casual situation, from shambling ... read more click to read

an x large. it was a little loose on him, but it shrunk a little after the first wash and fits him really well now. it's pretty breathable. i do agree with a lot of the other reviews that it is not the same quality as the original but still is very nice and light weight. definitely will get him another one in a different color. this review was originally posted to thenorthface.com. read more about this product ktipps 4 months ago love it this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. ktipps 4 months ago i love this sweatshirt. the ua logo in a rubbery material and the quality seems it will all hold up well. it didn't shrink a whole lot when dried. it is so comfortable. i'm a female, but i thought if it's too big, i'll give it to my boyfriend. if it fits true to size, i'll wear it around the house. worked it in my favor, alllright. stitches 3 years ago graphite with black stitching this reviewer rated product 4 out of 5 stars. stitches 3 years ago 1st one of these hoodies i purchased was the navy color with the grey stitching. i loved the look how the stiches popped and the comfort was way above average. i decided to purchase the graphite color because it was the only other color, besides bright green, that had the look with the different colored stitching that i like. when i received the graphite hoodie, it was all one solid color, no black stitching as illustrated. still a nice hoodie, but not the look i wanted or thought i was getting. ... read more click to read full text of review titled "graphite with black stitching". may not matter to others, just wanted to put it

this in black like 18 months ago (i think). then i saw the grey was on sale and figured as much as i like the first one, might as well get another. i like the way it wears, does not stretch out and look like it's years old after wearing it all day. really like the neck, and the buttons. only thing i'd like to see is maybe some hidden seem pockets, that would make it perfect.
