rated product 4 out of 5 stars. anonymous 2 months ago i love these shoes as they are easy to slip on and off when i run to do errands. many people have complimented me on the style and super cute doggy pattern. and when i tell them that part of the purchase goes to support our furry friends, it makes folks that more enamored with them. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. anonymous 4 months ago i love these shoes! this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 4 months ago i am an avid animal lover and advocate. kind of a crazy cat lady. i bought the cat faces shoes in pink and i love them! i almost never wear flat shoes like those, but they are so cute and i wanted to support the cause. i was totally pleasantly surprised by how comfortable they are and i don't feel like i'm walking barefoot on concrete. i'm going to buy a couple more pair with cats on them. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. read more about this product anonymous 2 weeks ago super comfy - no support this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 2 weeks ago i love my bobs. i wear them all the time. however they offer little support to my soles and heels. i wish the base was just a little thicker, but i love them nonetheless. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. anonymous 2 months ago very disappointed in this shoe. this reviewer rated product 3 out of 5 stars. anonymous 2 months ago i was very disappointed in this shoe. same size as the other shoes i ordered and i couldn't even get my foot halfway into the shoe. instead of sending back, i gave them to my daughter-in-law: she wears a smaller size than me and the shoes fit her. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. read more about this product anonymous 1 month ago my loafers this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 1 month ago i am a 2 time cancer survivor, my feet always hurt. i have been wearing sketchers for over 2 yrs. i have never found a more comfortable shoe ever. these are pillows on my feet and true to size, even when my feet swell up a bit. i recommend sketchers full heartedly. . this review was originally posted to skechers.com. charyoga 2 months ago like walking on air this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. charyoga 2 months ago i bought these shoes a few weeks ago and i love them. like walking on air, perfect fit, however, i had tried on sizes in the store and i had to order a full size larger than i usually buy. read more about this product anonymous 3 months ago comfy and i like the fabric they're made from this reviewer rated product 4 out of 5 stars. anonymous 3 months ago the outer fabric is really nice and they're comfortable even after a full day on my feet. the memory foam isn't as cushy as i would like but they're still comfy after wearing all day this review was originally posted to skechers.com. heatheru 12 months ago absolutely love! my favorite shoes! this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. heatheru 12 months ago i've had solid black bobs with the memory foam sole, and i wore them to work until they couldn't be wore any longer. they are by far my favorite and most comfortable. i never have to worry about my feet or back hurting when i wear these to work, as i could tell a huge difference when i chose to wear a different type of shoe to work one day and it didn't last 2 hours before i could tell a huge difference! i also love the stretchy soft material these have, that my last bobs didn't have. read more about this product bsbs 3 months ago air walkers this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. bsbs 3 months ago i saw the shoes on a coworker & loved the style, design & colors. she shared the value for her dollar (price wise) & i was sold. then she took them off to show me how weightless they were and i had to have them. she told me they were machine washable and i thought where has this been all my 18 years of nursing. i spent hours online finding them in my size. i wore them today and look forward to my next purchase. thanks so much for thinking of us. this review was originally posted to naturalizer.com. jacketmowitz 1 year ago not what i expected.. this reviewer rated product 3 out of 5 stars. jacketmowitz 1 year ago i ordered these as a casual alternative to traditional white keds. i was disappointed when they arrived because they appeared and felt similar to a pair of crocs. it is certainly a light shoe and the patterned fabric is interesting, but it wasn't what i expected. i also had difficulty getting the shoe on my foot. struggled to zip the zipper up and when i got it up the shoe was just too snug for comfort. i'm returning them tomorrow and won't be purchasing any other shoe in this line. it isn't a ... read

ago very stylish with the raised heel. the memory foam really makes them comfortable to wear. the fit is a little tight at first, but i'm sure with wear they will loosen. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. anonymous 9 months ago highly recommended i would buy more if there were more color this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 9 months ago i bought these for work and casual. i love them, they are comfortable, true to size and width. i am a size 7 with a narrow foot, they fit perfect i only wish they had a brown in a regular fabric, verses the mesh type. highly recommended, i am 63 and wanted a slight heel to help me with back discomfort that comes with flats. oh, and i love accumulating the skechers points, they are so generous and allow you to use a second catalog coupon code too. this review was originally posted to skechers.com. read more about this product anonymous 2 months ago gift for niece this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 2

definitely buy this product again - to help pets this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. anonymous 2 months ago what is great about the product and attracted me - is that i love animals anything

purchased them to replace a pair that was falling apart (made by a cheaper brand). what a difference in comfort and quality! this is actually a second pair of the exact same shoe -- back up pair as i'm wearing this shoe every day and want an exact replacement when i need it. i normally wear an 8-1/2 shoe. ordered the size 8 after reading reviews. they fit perfectly. because they are leather
