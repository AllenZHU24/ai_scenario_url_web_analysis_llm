reviewer rated product 3 out of 5 stars. anonymous 1 month ago shrinks by about 1-1.5 inch in the length after washing. a note mentioning this along with shrinkage in the waist would have been helpful. as it is, i can't return this now and am disappointed. this review was originally posted to wrangler.com. read more about this product 3lll 1 month ago they are a great fit on my husband this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. 3lll 1 month ago i bought 2 pair of these jeans for my husband s 80 th birthday. anonymous 3 years ago durable denim this reviewer rated product 4 out of 5 stars. anonymous 3 years ago i own two pair of these jeans they are cut a little bigger in the waist, seat, and thigh than the 936 so if you need a little extra room in those areas this jean is perfect. i usually wear a 36 waist in the 936 slim but purchase a 34 in the 13mwz and they seem to fit me about the same in the waist while giving you some extra room in the seat and thigh. this jean seems to have a slightly lower rise than the 936 as well which may contribute to the need to size down in the waist. this review was originally posted to wrangler.com. read more about this product linda1044 2 weeks ago great jeans, great fit! this reviewer rated product 4 out of 5 stars. linda1044 2 weeks ago i bought these jeans for my husband because the last ones i purchased for him are so worn that they now qualify for "work" jeans rather than "nice" jeans. he loves the fit. the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that unfortunately there was a tiny flaw in the fabric on the front leg. we thought it was probably too much of a pain to send back, so i reinforced the stitching with some hand sewing. this review was originally posted to dickies.com. nomad57 2 weeks ago comfortable jeans this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. nomad57 2 weeks ago these jeans are real comfortable i use them for work and for casual wear. this review was originally posted to dickies.com. read more about this product southwesttrekker 4 years ago awesome pants for the trail! this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. southwesttrekker 4 years ago i brought these pants almost a year ago wondering if they'd make a great alternative to the pricey pants available for hiking and backpacking that tend to be much more pricier. i figured, since they were nylon and light weight, they should hold up in the back country and on treks to the summit. these pants have been great! i have slipped and tumbled upon cacti, sand, gravel, brush, rocks, and boulders and these pants continue to hold up in excellent fashion. no rips or tears or fading. i've put ... read more click to read full text of review titled "awesome pants for the trail!". rough miles on these pants on and off trails and will continue to purchase more. no need to spend more on pricier brands from the outdoor world when these do just as great a if not better job out in the field. gator6 4 years ago nicely done this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. gator6 4 years ago these type of pants are hard to find for a reasonable price, these hit the mark for me. very lightweight and very comfortable, although be aware that sizing runs smaller than you're probably used to. try them on first if you can, eg, if you normally take an "l", you will probably need an "xl" to get the right fit. you will need to have the length taken up most likely, so the zipper at the bottom will have to go. that wasn't an issue for me, my only initial concern was the sewn in adjustable belt ... read more click to read full text of review titled "nicely done". and whether or not it would retain an iwb holster sufficiently.......in my case it did just fine for something like a kahr pm40 and/or a ruger lcr, very comfortably. wouldn't even try for a full size 1911, but maybe a lightweight commander would be ok. so i'm very satisfied with these pants, so much so that i bought 3 of them and was glad to find different colors. good job. read more about this product familyguymandudeperson 2 months ago worth every penny. this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. familyguymandudeperson 2 months ago i own 5 different colors of these pants and rotate them every day of the week to work(with my 15+ ua polos). im a physical therapist constantly moving and demonstrating exercises in these pants. the waistband is slightly elastic
