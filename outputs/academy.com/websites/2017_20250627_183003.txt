bought two colors and later had my wife buy the other two. i wear them for any workout; running, cross fit, lounging doing 12oz curls. two issues however, the shorts tend to get a little heavy further along in a workout as they absorb quite a bit of sweat. when i do a 4-6 mile run i can def feel them start to sag. the other issue is i wish i would have bought the mediums rather than larges. i am a 35" waist so i figured better be safe and go with large, but ... read more click to read full text of review titled "great shorts for everyday workouts". these shorts wear big. other than that i love the length, i just wish there were more colors. i'm glad shorts are shorts again! #freethethighs bluebirdsuns 1 year ago fit tall women well this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. bluebirdsuns 1 year ago most women's running shorts are "low rise" and fit well below the navel and have miniscule pockets (if any). i am 5'9" and 150 lb and these shorts (medium) fit great for jogging and fast walking (up to a marathon). they sit about 1/2 inch below the navel and are very comfortable. the pockets easily hold key, running gels (2 in each pocket) without bouncing the items around too much. i clip my sansa mp3 player to the elastic band and the band sturdily holds the player without rolling down. the ... read more click to read full text of review titled "fit tall women well". liner has

ago solid quality this reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. montrealcn 5 months ago overall the quality is quite good, the cut is nice and functional, the split really helps the ventilation. the two small pouches in the back is smart, one for small key, one can hold something like energy gel pouch for long run. the fabrics weighs nothing. the only minor concern is waist band is on the tight side, but it doesn't bother me during the run. done a few 1hr+ runs, the fabrics were soft enough there is no chafing [this review was collected as part of a promotion.] this review was originally
