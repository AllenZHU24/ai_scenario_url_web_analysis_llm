jacket, for an upcoming hunt in alberta. i've only used it about four days, but it fit me great and kept me warm when the temperatures were between 32 degrees and 38 degrees fahrenheit. i haven't put it through tough, wet conditions yet but i'm pretty confident that it would hold up well and keep me warm. i bought a large, per other reviewers suggestions and i don't think it could fit me better. i typically wear medium shirts. i would ... read more recommend this jacket as it seems to be pretty good quality, especially for the price. setxyakhunter 3 years ago great jacket bought this thing

him one. i was unable to get him one last year since the online academy no longer had them and the stores were sold out. i waited for this past december, 2015, and found it online. my dad loved it. it's awesome, you can wear when hunting or reverse it to a casual look. i'm a female, it's a bit heavy; hence it's a "man jacket" lol. but it's awesome and keeps warm!!! :) read more about this

warm in freezing temperatures but great for rain and cool weather. txgunrunner2020 9 months ago fits well over clothes and keeps you dry i bought the jacket and pants and am happy with both. i am 5' 11" 175lb. and purchased the large for each. they each come with a built-in pouch and are fairly easy to re-pack into the pouch. i thoroughly tested each right out of the box by suiting up and hopping into the shower. i found the jacket will leak slightly around the zipper, but only if spraying directly with the shower head. that amount of direct water and pressure will most likely not happen in the field so i am not too concerned but ... read more i gave it 4 instead of 5 as a result. i would not call the material absolutely quiet when moving but quiet enough if still hunting w/ slight
