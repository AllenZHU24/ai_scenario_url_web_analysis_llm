"hey adp!  i got the ppe in wenesday and i went to the track tonight and made a pass on level 5.  it went 13.97 at 96 mph.  my truck is stock as a rock other than the ppe, so i'm really pleased. that's the only racing it will ever see...it was great doing business with you." - dave deramus, louisiana "i called and ordered guages and full pillar mounts from you.  they were sent next day air and arrived the next morning as scheduled. i was very pleased with the serivce and also the shipping of the product.  when i talked with your company all it seemed you had was black.  when i got the product your salesman had found the color i wanted (taupe) and shipped them instead.  to my amazement on thursday i recieved a phone call from the salesman wanting to know if my order had arrived and if i was pleased with everything.  let me tell you something, with service like that and following up on orders you have my business and i will pass your site on to everyone i know and will recommend you highly. you have got all of my business from now on. hats off to your sales department and to the salesman who took care of my order, he deserves some praise and a huge bonus for going above and beyond the call of duty. thanks for everything and the whole setup i recieved worked great and looks awesome. i am looking forward to doing business in the future and keep up the great work." - weston robertson, texas "i just wanted to let you know how pleased i am with all of the products. i had to install them a piece at a time so it has taken a while to get back to you with the results. it did allow me to conduct some interesting mileage gain tests, though. before installing anything i ran the truck up to my favorite fishing hole, about 100 miles round trip. i set the cruise at 55 mph and monitored my mileage gauge. prior to any modifications/installs, i got 18.5 mpg round trip. i then installed the s & b intake and mileage jumped up to 19.2 on the same trip, same parameters. then, i had the magnaflow exhaust installed and repeated the trip again...now mileage was 20.7. finally, i installed the pmt and, after training the transmission (as per instructions), i set the pmt on extreme and drove once again out to my fishing hole. round trip mileage was 24.5!!! i was very, very pleased with this. so far, my city driving mileage has improved from average 14 mpg to 17.5 mpg. again, very, very pleased with this. as for performance, well, let me just say this huge truck moves when you want it to. power while towing is phenominal. i towed a 3,000 lb load on a single axle trailer for 500 miles round trip and got 17.5 mpg at avg speed of 65 mph. the truck never even shifted out of overdrive, even while going up steep alaskan hills that required a truck passing lane. had to push the limits just once to see if the de-fueler works, and it did...as advertised. feel much safer with that feature working. overall, i am extremely pleased with these products and with the customer service. i went back and forth with e-mails while still in iraq and despite the time difference, the sales rep had patience with me and answered all my questions. everything was waiting for me when i got home. thanks to all of you...great products, great service." - heath tempel "i have received my order and installed it. everyone was very helpfull and answered all my questions. thanks again and i look forward to doing buisness in the future." - robert steiner home | contact us | gallery | resources | sitemap tm/(c)2008-2013 by alligator diesel performance llc. all rights reserved. dodge 5.9l cummins 89-93 dodge 5.9l cummins 94-02 dodge 5.9l cummins 03-04 dodge 5.9l cummins 04.5-07 dodge 6.7l cummins 07.5-09 dodge 6.7l cummins 10-up gm duramax 6.6l 01-04 lb7 gm duramax 6.6l 04.5-05 lly gm duramax 6.6l 06-07 lbz gm duramax 6.6l 07.5-10 lmm gm duramax 6.6l 11-up lml ford 7.3l powerstroke 95-97 ford 7.3l powerstroke 99-03 ford 6.0l powerstroke 03-07 ford 6.4l powerstroke 08-10 ford 6.7l powerstroke 11-up ford f150 97-03 ford f150 04-08 ford f150 09-present ford f150 3.5l ecoboost subaru wrx & sti 02-07 subaru wrx 08-10 subaru wrx 11-12 subaru sti 08-10 subaru sti 11-13
