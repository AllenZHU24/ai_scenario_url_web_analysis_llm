contact us shipping policy conditions of use returns procedure new diesel performance products home » shipping & returns shipping & returns did you know?  ups my choice now offers more flexibility for the customer to take delivery of their shipments.  you can choose to re-route shipments or reschedule deliveries to fit your needs.  see ups.com to sign up. ***shipping and processing times*** most shipments arrive within a week, depending on your location.  if you would like to track your order, please log in to your account for any available tracking numbers or check your email for updates. we use ups, fedex, and the us postal service to ship our products.  we try to process all orders same business day, with the exception of holidays and weekends. processing times can vary due to circumstances, so please allow 24 hours for processing or longer for special order items.  we reserve the right to alternate between carriers at our discretion.  cut off time for next day delivery is 1:30 p.m. pst, however this may vary depending on availability and any processing delays.  some items are packaged in usps flat rate boxes and will be delivered by the post office.  some shipments may require truck freight due to weight and appropriate charges will apply. most all of our items are shipped "adult signature required" due to the cost of parts.  a signature will be required at your delivery address unless you release us from liability and authorize delivery without signature. if a shipment is refused or non-deliverable and is returned to us, customer will be responsible for any redelivery charges and restocking fees. we are not responsible for addresses deemed undeliverable or redirected for pick-up at an alternate location by the carrier. ups and fedex maintain the option to require a signature at the time of delivery, regardless of the recipients' request to leave the packages at the door.  we make every effort to ship as requested but, the carrier reserves the right (as the responsible party) to make any changes based on the value of the shipment or other liability considerations. occasionally, the shipping calculator on our site does not accurately compute the express freight charges. in those instances where the initial charge for freight is not sufficient to cover our costs, we will contact you to collect the difference in costs or arrange a different shipping method. ***international shipping*** international shipments and shipments outside the lower 48 states are subject to shipping quotes and approval.  we reserve the right to cancel an order and issue a full refund for shipments not covered in our regularly serviced area.   the customer will be responsible for all duties, taxes, and fees for international shipments. any uncollected fees will be charged to customer and cannot be refunded. customer agrees to this policy by purchasing with alligator performance.  all items will be valued at full purchased value. ***backorders or delays*** if an item is on back order or must be drop shipped from a manufacturer, we will notify you via email once we are notified by the warehouse. make sure we have a valid email address for you! some items are special order or come directly from the manufacturer.  delays in processing times or shipping can occur for these items.  your patience is appreciated. periodically, a part may be discontinued or temporarily unavailable that is listed on our website due to changes or production issues by the manufacturer.  we make every attempt to maintain current information and are not responsible for any manufacturing delays. home | contact us | gallery | resources | sitemap tm/(c)2008-2012 by alligator diesel performance llc. all rights reserved. dodge 5.9l cummins 89-93 dodge 5.9l cummins 94-02 dodge 5.9l cummins 03-04 dodge 5.9l cummins 04.5-07 dodge 6.7l cummins 07.5-09 dodge 6.7l cummins 10-up gm duramax 6.6l 01-04 lb7 gm duramax 6.6l 04.5-05 lly gm duramax 6.6l 06-07 lbz gm duramax 6.6l 07.5-10 lmm gm duramax 6.6l 11-up lml ford 7.3l powerstroke 95-97 ford 7.3l powerstroke 99-03 ford 6.0l powerstroke 03-07 ford 6.4l powerstroke 08-10 ford 6.7l powerstroke 11-up gm duramax agri-power 95-97 gm duramax agri-power 95-97 gm duramax agri-power 95-97 gm duramax agri-power 95-97 gm duramax agri-power 95-97
