culture prayer & inspirationst. andrew’s christmas novena begins november 30th! november 28, 2015 by gretchen filz 50 comments november 30th is the feast day of st. andrew the apostle. st. andrew was the very first disciple called by our lord, and he is the one who got his brother, st. peter, to become jesus’ disciple too.  we all know how the rest turned out. the feast of st. andrew marks the end of the liturgical year and the beginning of a new year with the start of advent. in fact, the sunday that falls nearest to st. andrew’s feast day on november 30th is always the first sunday of advent. there are many popular traditions associated with st. andrew’s feast day, especially in those countries that have him as their patron saint, scotland and russia. but the most popular st. andrew’s feast day tradition is for everyone, and that is the tradition to begin a christmas novena prayer on st. andrew’s feast day. it’s called the st. andrew christmas novena, or more simply, the christmas novena, and it’s a wonderful way to enter into the advent season that is marked by a time of anticipation, penance, and prayer. while the origins of this prayer are unknown, it is over 100 years old at least and may have come from ireland. if the st. andrew novena was prayed as a traditional nine-day novena, it would end on the feast of the immaculate conception on december 8th.  however, this novena prayer is actually traditionally prayed much longer than nine days—it is prayed through all four weeks of advent. it is piously believed that whoever recites the st. andrew christmas novena prayer fifteen times each day from the feast of st. andrew (30th november) until christmas eve will obtain the favor requested. it won’t be easy to pray this novena 15 times a day for 25 days, but if you are able to, this prayer will undoubtedly leave your heart well-prepared to welcome the coming of christ. the beauty and sweetness of this prayer will unfold for you through its daily recitation, allowing you to meditate more fully on the profound mystery of the incarnation. go ahead and memorize it, copy and save it to your desktop, print it out and stick it on your car dashboard, write it on your arm, or whatever you need to do to help you remember to pray it each day until christmas eve. st. andrew christmas novena hail and blessed be the hour and moment in which the son of god was born of the most pure virgin mary, at midnight, in bethlehem, in the piercing cold. in that hour vouchsafe, i beseech thee, o my god, to hear my prayer and grant my desires through the merits of our savior jesus christ, and of his blessed mother. amen. prayer is an essential part of advent. reciting this special novena prayer each day is a simple yet beautiful way to celebrate the spiritual significance of the advent season and to experience a deeper conversion to jesus.  the st. andrew christmas novena is commonly found in many advent prayer books which are also loaded with many other beautiful prayers and traditions for this time of year. have you made the st. andrew christmas novena a part of your advent prayers in the past? if so, what blessings and graces did you receive? this article

saints/ prayercomments jason schaum says november 29, 2012 at 8:02 pm love it, thanks gretchen. did not know about this, but i am throwing it in the mix for advent. andrew is my confirmation name, so i especially like this prayer; plus, i love finding long-time church prayers & practices and reviving them in my own prayer life. gretchen says november 30, 2012 at 9:21 am fantastic! happy st. andrew’s feast day! you especially will get a lot out of this prayer with st. andrew as your patron. i’m going to attempt this prayer too this advent–for the first time. and i totally agree with you about finding long-time catholic prayers and practices. there are loads around christmas time, for example, st. nicholas day (dec. 6) where the kids leave their shoes out and find them filled with treats in the morning (st. therese talks about this practice in her family) and st. lucy’s day (dec. 13) with a special procession at her feast day mass with little girls holding candles. kathy says november 30, 2012 at 7:51 pm i thought you might like to know that the novena to the holy spirit is the oldest novena in the church. at one time long,long ago,the novena to the holy spirit was the only novena acknowledged by the church. jason schaum says december 1, 2012 at 12:17 am rick steves had a european christmas special on pbs which featured a st lucy procession, i think it was in a scandinavian country. the little blonde girls did look like little angels with their candles. bits of europe seem to hold on to the traditions, despite the secularization said to be taking place. hope these traditions become more widely adopted, instead of fading. nothing is impossible with our lord, i s’pose… mark says december 26, 2012 at 1:29 am my late wife rosann (god rest her soul) was a dialysis patient for several years. she suffered many other ailments, mostly with saintly acceptance, but the dialysis was a true torment for her. the thrice weekly treatment filled her with dread the preceding day. she often refused to go and i had to take her forcibly to get her to her appointments. some patients talked about being wheeled to a beach somewhere and just being left to die. rosann sympathized with that notion or desire. one day she heard of the st. andrew novena. she loved the saints, most loved was our lady, but a favorite was st anthony who had helped her find many lost items, dogs and even children, one 6 year old girl lost in a pig barn at the state fair. she turned to st. andrew for intercession. her petition was to be off dialysis one way or the other (morte) by christmas. she began the novena with great confidence. as i remember she was crying one day because she fell asleep before finishing the prayers. i assured her our lord understood her and her abilities, that she had no worries about her prayers being denied because of a couple hours sleep. her novena continued. a few days before christmas her doctor informed rosann that her “levels” were looking good and the doctor was taking her off dialysis for one week and “one week only”. i should say rosann was a difficult patient at times. rosann informed her doctor, who was a practicing catholic, that st andrew would be the judge of that. rosann was off dialysis for almost five years. her kidneys maintained about 20% function through that time. rosann passed away july of 2011, she had recently returned to a dialysis regiment and her passing was marked by god’s grace in many ways. god’s will, st. andrews intercession and rosann’s faith – three things i am most sure of. lord have mercy on us. st. andrew pray for us. anna says december 3, 2013 at 10:16 am hello, this is my first year saying the christmas novena of st. andrew. i’ve been dealing with seasonal depression and just want some heavenly intercession. i am hopeful after hearing everyone praise st. andrew. my “go to guys” are usually st. anthony & st. dominic who have assisted with my many blessings already. so, thank you for posting this prayer as well. 🙂 suzanne says december 8, 2013 at 3:51 pm hi. this is my first time hearing about the st. andrew advent novena prayer. i know i am late but does anyone know if it would be ok to start the prayer today. thank you vicena moguel says december 27, 2013 at 7:23 pm hi, my family, friends, and i have been saying this novena for more than 40 years. it has become my tradition to distribute copies of this novena every year. some people have asked me if i have this in spanish and chinese…do you know of anyone who has this in the said languages or can probably translate them in both languages? i will truly appreciate it if we can obtain this prayer translated in spanish and chinese. thank you so much and god bless you. irish kathy says november 20, 2014 at 1:58 pm i have prayed this prayer every year for as long as i can remember. it is literally a family tradition. it was originally suggested to my mom by a friend she worked with before she was married to my dad. there is usually some discernable benefit from praying it, even if it’s of a spiritual nature. btw, keep praying it, even if you miss some days along the way, or don’t pray it 15 times on a particular day. it’s the persistence with the prayer that’s most important. mariaelena says november 24, 2014 at 1:59 am i love this prayer i have been doing this for many years. last year a prayer i prayed which i thought impossible came to past at the beginning of 2014. thank you st andrew thank you jesus. god bless janine says november 26, 2014 at 4:30 am thank you very much for sharing the saint andrew christmas novena. i was searching for a special novena to recite for my upcoming milestone birthday on christmas eve, and this is the one. my best wishes to all for a most peaceful, holy and blessed christmas. a. hickson says november 29, 2014 at 12:45 am ave maria,this will be the first year i will be reciting this novena to st andrew as i will be praying for him to intercede for my sons to return to their catholic faith and to find steady jobs. thank you for bringing this to everyone’s attention. wishing you all out there a very joyfilled and blessed christmas and a prosperous & happier new year! david dodd says november 29, 2014 at 7:38 am the miracle of the christmas novena 40 years later by james m. craciun it was november 30,1961 and i was in the fifth grade at our lady of mount carmel catholic school. i fondly remember mother agatha, a trinitarian sister who was my teacher. she was the first teacher to inspire in me the appreciation of our great american history. she since has gone on to her just reward. on that cold november day, the feast of st andrew the apostle, sister taught us to pray a novena. she called it the christmas novena. she said that if we said this prayer 15 times each night starting on the feast of st andrew (november 30) until christmas eve we could ask god for anything we wanted. wow i thought. this would be great. so faithfully with the innocence of the child i was, i began my christmas novena and this is it: hail and blessed be the hour and moment in which the son of god was born of the most pure virgin mary at midnight in bethlehem in the piercing cold. at that hour vouch-safe, oh my god, to hear my prayer and grant my desires through the merits of our savior jesus christ and his blessed mother amen. so here it was the day before christmas .-our family name, cracium, means christmas in romanian, the nationality i am on my fathers-side of the family. i would be going caroling, as was our romanian tradition with the kids group of st. helenaâ€™s romanian byzantine church. my mother and father would be cooking many kinds of fish for the italian vigil of christmas eve. i was also half italian as my motherâ€™s parents came from italy. well, i said my novena, and began to ask god for my requests-, i had quite a long list. you see, my brother joe, a freshman at st. edward high school, was in the hospital dying of tuberculosis of the kidneys. he had unpasteurized milk on a family trip and was the only one to get sick. god i said, you must cure my brother. my dad, who received the purple heart in world war ii, had reached the point where he could barely walk. he was a big man, so i asked god that as bad as his leg and back would get he would always be able walk to keep his independence. my oldest brother was in a gang that caused a big ruckus at old west high school (west side story) that was playing at theaters then, was reality in our neighborhoods. the west 58th street boys, southside gang, halloran park boys and the 117 street gang would put the fear of god in any kid who drifted from his own neighborhood. please, god, i prayed. donâ€™t ,let my brother jack get killed or be sent to jail. i asked god next for a cadillac. you see, my dad, was a funeral director and we all lived upstairs from the funeral parlor. berry’s funeral home down the street had a shiny new cadillac and dad had a big buick. it was a great car but dad needed a cadillac. now it was time for my request. i had served mass every christmas since i became an altar boy, but this year i was not chosen so that, another boy would have a chance. i was angry, god, if this novena is really true, i will serve mass tomorrow. on christmas morning, even with my brother so sick, mom and dad had a christmas morning for us. we went to 9:30 a.m. mass. the bell rang and one altar boy came out with the priest. i ran into the sacristy as last as i could to serve mass, i said, thank you god. today, i am married to a wonderful wife and have five precious children. my brother joe is my partner in the funeral homes jack is do great and never went to jail. my dad got his cadillac a month later. he died in 1985 and could walk a bit until his last day on earth. i can tell you this novena works and there are miracles to be had this christmas. thank you mother agatha and thank you god. reprinted from catholic universe bulletin all rights reserved marian waguespack says november 29, 2014 at 11:14 pm this is a beautiful novena and a great way to focus on the real meaning of the advent season. i say the novena every year. thanks for publishing it! have wonderful holiday season. thank you. marian rose says november 30, 2014 at 10:12 am i’m so thankful to have seen this novena. i grew up with my mother swearing by this prayer. she used it so many times. i can’t wait to start praying this as i have a heavy heart and i will start it now. thank you for sharing this. emma says december 17, 2014 at 9:56

receive, knock..”etc on the back of the card i wrote, i pray to marry a good, catholic man before i am thirty and have two children..” my prayer was answered. i believe in this prayer. i believe in the power of prayer. god does listen, hear all our prayers. we must trust in the lord.. seek him o ut.. i have witnessed miracles, prayed and been apart of miracles. we all are miracles.. just believe. there’s this one word.. hope… i live by this word alone amen xox margaret walsh-spatafora says november 27, 2015 at 9:10 pm i have been praying this prayer since my mother passed away. i found it with all of her prayers. there was a note to me in it telling me that she had been saying this along time . she said i brought it home from school when i was in the 2nd. grade, and been been saying it all these yrs. so i had to start saying it in her honor. i have been saying it since 2002. it’s a wonderful prayer. ann says november 28, 2015 at 6:44 pm i said this prayer way back when i was still in school, in 1988 i prayed this prayer and asked for a husband and father for my children. my prayer was granted. i also prayed for a new house and was able to buy a new house. now again i will pray this prayer for a good job for my husband who lost his job last year. this prayer will be answered i know it will be. christina fonseca says november 28, 2015 at 9:25 pm in spanish: alabada y bendta sean la hora y el momento en el que el hijo de dios nació de la más pura virgen maria, a medianoche en belén en el frío penetrante. en esa hora dígnate dios mío escuchar mi oración y conceder mis deseos, por los méritos de nuestro señor jesucristo y de su santísima madre. amén lori sigl says november 29, 2015 at 2:29 pm bless her soul, my mum taught me the st. andrew novena and said it 15x daily for the entire 25 between thanksgiving and christmas. her intentions were always for other people. in honor of a spiritual and loving mum, i continue this tradition. my intention this year is for my pastor, father tim shillcox, and my church family, our lady of lourdes depere to more fully experience the true meaning of christmas. i also ask for god’s grace on all people to experience a nudge that brings them closer to god. robert laity says november 30, 2015 at 12:06 am i always try to say this prayer but have never gotten through praying it for the entire 25 days. i am going to try again today. why isn’t this prayer prayed for 27 days? that would make it a triple (9) day novena. luis justo gonzalez says november 30, 2015 at 7:52 am i started this prayer given to me by my daughter in november 2010. i prayed it that year and it was a beautiful year with all my wishes of abundance of happiness , riches , love , new business and great life realized unfortunetaley the lord took her away december 2,2011 , i was so depressed i didn’t do the prayer that year. i regained strength to continue and did the prayer 2012,13 and 14 and everything i have asked has been given specially raising her son that she left us and is exactly like her that we are re raising her thru him. he has brought so much strength and life to our home that today we are starting it together. thank you lord for your love and compassion. amen. beverly says november 30, 2015 at 9:20 am i have been praying this novena since i found it while working at my church. i traditionally send it to my children on this day in hope that they will follow my lead. many prayers have been answered over the years. this year i continue the tradition for a special prayer. may god bless all who say this novena. beautiful catholic prayers says november 30, 2015 at 11:35 pm i added this prayer to “beautiful catholic prayers” with check mark boxes to help you keep track of your progress. have a blessed

andrew’s intercession, for answering my prayer 10x more than i asked. truly, god will not be outdone in generosity. jmj+ cindy says december 7, 2015 at 1:59 pm thanks for sharing, i am so happy to hear that this is the first novena, my mother prayed many years for my sisters and i to return to our faith. i am the only one so far, and it happened right after she passed away, on january 5th 2015. i am having a hard time dealing with her death plus depression which i hope in time i will get the help…. i am hoping that saying the st-andrew’s novena will help me get through this time in my life… thanks again elizabeth says december 9, 2015 at 3:53 am hi i came across this novena this year, st andrew is the patron saint of our parish. i started with the novena from 30th nov 2015 and within 2 days my one intention was fulfilled now i am continuing with the novena and i am sure that my second intention will also be fulfilled. both these intentions were next to impossible things which i have received. i can’t thank enough for this miracles happening to me through this novena and st.andrew. i thank you jesus a million times for all your blessings. all those who have any incomplete desires ask lord through this novena and it will happen for sure. praise you lord ! julia says december 15, 2015 at 12:38 am we had been trying to get a small farm for years. it was so frustrating over the years of things falling through, that i finally just gave it all to st. joseph, and asked that we would get a farm, or i would find peace and accept staying in the city. then my friend gave me this novena, so i tried it. well, st. andrew and st. joseph must have worked together on this one. it was a miracle that a farm came up in our price range. it was so underpriced that there was a bidding war, but the owners just liked us for some reason and so decided we should get it, no matter what the other offers were. not only is it more peaceful and beautiful than i could have asked for, but the neighborhood church is, of course, st. joseph’s, and the farmer who used to own the land we are on goes there, and so do both our son’s coaches from the public school (in an area that is not very catholic, quite the coincidence!) so our land has always been owned by devout catholics. my kids are so happy here, and my son even bucks bales for that farmer, and because the church is so welcoming, even my husband has become involved which he has never done before, and grown in his faith much. as i was walking to communion yesterday, the farmer was right in front of me in line, and i realized how much my family and i have been taken care of, and given more than i could’ve asked for. thank you st. andrew and st. joseph! darren says december 23, 2015 at 5:07 pm i love this christmas prayer… i was introduced to it by my wife as she would pray it as a young girl. this beautiful prayer saved my life as i’m a pre liver transplant patient in 2010 i had a tube that went into my liver and the top would hang outside onto my side. it was painful and scary & worry some because it needed to be changed out every 6 week’s. doctors told me that i needed to have this a lifetime but that didn’t sit well with me i went to different doctors and they all told me that they wouldn’t touch it, until i went to one doctor he didn’t understand why i have this tube inside me so long it was only used for 3 months & i had it over a year. he was afraid to remove it as he was unsure the outcome so he would follow up with the 6 week change out. november30 came and i had my entire family say this beautiful prayer december 23 one day before the end of the prayer my doctor calls me and tells me to check into the hospital december 26 he has it all set up to remove this tube for good.it’s been 5 years without that tube i still keep the prayer every year though, this prayer work’s just believe in it god will bless you. thank you lord god lord jesus christ & mother mary i’m forever grateful to you i love you above all else patricia says december 27, 2015 at 10:22 am every year a woman in my parish would give out holy cards with the christmas novena. i would take the card but thought i could never remember to say the prayer 15 times a day. three years ago i came across one of the novena cards and was determined to try. it came to me that i could say it in 3 groups of 5 repetitions – the trinity and the five wounds of christ- throughout the day. i love that simple prayer so much i find myself occasionally saying it more than 15 times a day. thus far what i have asked for has not come about. but i will begin again next year. patricia says december 28, 2015 at 1:31 am i prayed the novena for about 10 days or so. when i skipped a day, i would say it 30x. i didn’t ask for a particular favor and left it with god. my husband was offered a job that he really needed and wanted. thank you st. andrew for the intercession. god is always merciful and kind. blessed be god forever! patricia says december 28, 2015 at 1:36 am and thank you to our blessed mother mary, our powerful intercessor! a mommy in boston says december 30, 2015 at 11:00 pm thank you, st. andrew, for interceding on my behalf and answering my prayer intention! i have started this novena a few times before but never finished it. this was the first year i made it through, saying all the prayers, and it was well worth the great effort. our pediatrician had diagnosed my 6 year old son with neurofibramatosis in the fall of this year, as he had met the initial diagnostic criteria. we went today to the neurologist for a follow-up visit, and he rescinded the diagnosis based on further testing. what a miracle! thank you, jesus! i am publishing this in thanksgiving for my answered prayer, a tremendous blessing. i have one other request that i had prayed for also, which has not been granted yet, but i am so grateful that this very important request was honored only five days after completing the novena. it truly does work. +jmj+ +amdg+ renate muller says january 20, 2016 at 11:32 am the st. andrew prayer was posted on our prayer line. i asked for a few things and i know some of them will be answered in god’s time. but one thing i did ask, just by the way, that my eyes would be healed. due to severe dry eye, some thing was covering my cornea. the dr. was going to scrape the cornea. due to being close to christmas he wanted to wait until after the holy days. when i went back, my eyes were clean. he was so surprised and asked if i was praying. (followed by a haha). thank you father and st andrew. đồ chơi xe máy ở đà lạt says june 2, 2016 at 6:48 am those kinds of people have never felt the rage of road rash. you don’t want to make frequent visits to any laundry shop to get your jacket cleaned. while the entire hangar door construction defines the strength and wind load of a hangar, the signature survival feature of these hangars proved to be the doors. trackbacks how to celebrate advent like a catholic | the catholic company says: october 17, 2014 at 11:31 pm […] during the advent season. you can often find them in advent devotional books. there is also the st. andrew christmas novena which is traditionally prayed from the feast of st. andrew (november 30th) until christmas eve.
