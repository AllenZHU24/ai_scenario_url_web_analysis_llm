"i am glad that so many of the faithful are helping and supporting our need to evangelize the poor." — father richard ho lung about the missionaries of the poor founded in 1981, by father richard ho lung, the missionaries of the poor is a monastic order whose mission is to offer “joyful service with christ on the cross”. the order began with two brothers in kingston, jamaica, and has now grown to over 500 brothers who serve 12 missions across the globe in places like haiti, philippines, india, africa, indonesia, and north carolina. granted vatican approval in 1998, the missionaries of the poor work to feed the hungry, house the homeless, counsel prisoners, care for street children, minister to the sick, preach the good news, and evangelize through music and song. led by father ho lung, the brothers and priests of the mop unite as one brotherhood in christ and live a materially simply and austere life. they take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and they promise to give free service to the poor. each brother has no personal property or bank accounts and everything is done in community including eating, sleeping, and traveling. more than just giving aid with food, clothing and shelter, the daily activities of the missionaries of the poor revolve around constant daily prayer and worship. over the years the catholic company has donated thousands of bibles, prayer books, rosaries, and many other catholic products to our friends at the missionaries of the poor. our ceo, james hetzel and his wife, whitney, as well as many other employees or family members have volunteered at their missions around the world. "thank you for the books and the bibles... we have begun teaching the catechism to our brothers, who in turn will teach our poor. i will also send copies to our communities in africa, the philippines, india and haiti. i am glad that so many of the faithful are helping and supporting our need to evangelize the poor." — father richard ho lung resources see our blog posts about the missionaries of the poor. get fed missionaries of the poor p o box 8523, 3 north street, kingston, jamaica, wi phone: (876) 967-0341, (876) 922-2676, usa: (404) 248-1197 email: mopja@cwjamaica.com visit: www.missionariesofthepoor.org recommended for you × ok customerservice@catholiccompany.com customer service shipping returns & exchanges gift card balance information center our company about us contact us blog careers privacy policy terms of service shop wish list printable order form parish/bulk orders affiliate program become an insider! sign up and get 15% off your next purchase. email address © 2020 trinity road, llc. all rights reserved. california: do not sell my information by using this site, you agree to the terms of our updated privacy policy. dismiss
