and what do you think about what he said?” keeping focused in the mass is not easy but with some useful tricks it can be accomplished. i find that one of the easiest ways to keep me focused in mass is through catholic prayer books. these books typically have catholic eucharistic prayers, prayers after mass, and prayers before mass. by reading these prayers one can prepare for mass and stay better focused during mass through the meditative state they invoke. you can never stop a distant baby from crying or silence a snoring child a few rows back, but you can prepare yourself by developing a mind of prayer during the mass so that those inherent distractions are far less distracting. by using catholic books and catholic prayers you can develop a routine of prayer during the mass which will help to keep you focused in the moment. i pray the same prayers before and after communion so that when i am approaching our lord in the holy sacrifice i am thinking about the lord, about his passion and resurrection. i would highly encourage everyone to develop a sort of mental prayer routine in the mass and especially during holy communion so that one can approach the blessed sacrament in not only physical reverence but mental as well. what are some of the ways that help you stay focused during mass?
