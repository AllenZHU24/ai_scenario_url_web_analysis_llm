send us an email. our stuff our goal is to provide the most useful products to make you look good, feel good, and be safe. pricing the barebones pricing policy is a no-nonsense, every day discounted price. we don’t raise our prices, then offer a discount. however, we like to show you how much you save by listing what our suppliers recommend we charge. delivery we try to ship as quickly as we can after we receive an order. if the processing time is extended due to agreements with some of our fulfillment centers, we will show that to you on the product page. we know getting your stuff to you as quickly as possible is paramount. your package could be delivered by ups or usps, depending on which service can get it to you the fastest. we’ll try our best around christmas time, but be prepared for delivery services to be backed up with the holiday rush. satisfaction please contact us for any question you have on a product, price or service issue. our staff wants you to have a purchase experience beyond your expectations. we want you to be a customer that would recommend us to your friends. if you like us, follow us on facebook or twitter. thank you very much for your business! stu nelson, head guy sacramento, ca 5800 madison avenue, suite y-1sacramento, ca 95841 hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 9:00am - 5:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (916) 334-9327fax: 1 (916) 334-9219email: store5@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map rancho cordova, ca 2340 sunrise blvd., #18rancho cordova, ca 95670 hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 9:00am - 5:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (916) 363-9327fax: 1 (916) 363-9331email: store2@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map auburn, ca 13420 lincoln wayauburn, ca 95603(in raley's shopping center) hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 9:00am - 5:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (530) 823-9327fax: 1 (530) 888-7451email: store3@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map west sacramento, ca 767 ikea court, suite 120west sacramento, ca 95605(riverpoint shopping center) hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 9:00am - 6:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (916) 372-9327fax: 1 (916) 372-9331email: store4@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map rocklin, ca - coming soon!!! 6644 lonetree boulevard, #3rocklin, ca 95765(next to sportsman's warehouse) hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 9:00am - 5:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (916) 287-9100fax: 1 (916) 737-5147email: store101@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map truckee, ca 11260 donner pass road, suite c-8truckee, ca 96161(gateway shopping center, near safeway) hours pst monday - friday 10:00am - 7:00pm saturday 10:00am - 5:00pm sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm phone: 1 (530) 582-9327fax: 1 (530) 582-1269email: store8@barebonesworkwear.com view larger map other locations corporate headquarters barebones workwear8555 weyand avenuesacramento, ca 95828phone: (916) 287-9842fax: (916) 737-5147 office@barebonesworkwear.com kentucky distribution center barebones workwear kentucky dc701 victoria hillmadisonville, ky 42431(270) 821-2226 kydc@barebonesworkwear.com contact information toll free: 1 (866) 489-4142 contact us store locator customer service orders and returns reward points embroidery & imprinting my account company information about us corporate accounts student programs rewards program shipping policy privacy policy facebooklike! 44,501 people like barebones workwear. toddbrandonkenmattleesakevin © 2014 barebonesworkwear. all rights reserved.
