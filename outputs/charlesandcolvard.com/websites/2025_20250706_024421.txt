moissanite is a gemstone born from the stars. it was first discovered in 1893 by a french scientist named henri moissan, who later won the nobel prize in chemistry. he discovered particles of the gem that would eventually bear his name in arizona, in a crater created by a meteorite that fell to earth. he initially thought that he had found diamonds, but later determined that the crystals were composed of silicon carbide. natural moissanite is incredibly rare, so moissanite available today is laboratory-created. after many years of trial and error, the particles moissan discovered were successfully synthesized to produce what is now one of the world’s most scintillating gemstones. moissanite is engineered to appear very similar to diamonds but is compositionally and visually quite different. the durability, brilliance, and fire of the two gems are quite distinct but are both very good thermal conductors. durability moissanite is extremely durable, tough, and second only to diamond in its resistance to scratching and abrasion. it scores a 9.25 on the mohs hardness scale. brilliance the most dominant feature of moissanite is its brilliance. when we refer to the brilliance of moissanite, we’re also referring to its sparkle. known for its high refractive index of 2.65, moissanite is quantifiably the most brilliant gemstone on earth! fire (dispersion) one of the most distinguishable elements of a moissanite gemstone is its fire or dispersion. dispersion is caused as light radiates through the gemstone on different wavelengths—each wavelength produces beautiful flashes of color throughout the gemstone. shop engagement rings shop wedding bands shop fine jewelry contact us chat call email companyabout usas seen inleadershipboard of directorspress relationsinvestor relationspaying it forwardcareersbenefitscustomer carefree shippingreturnspayment optionswarrantygeneral faqsservice portaltrade partnerseducationforever one™ moissanitecaydia® lab-grown diamondsblogfaqsmoissanite faqslab-grown diamonds faqsprecious gemstones faqsrecycled metals faqsget in touchemail uslive chatvirtual consultation877-202-5467visit usour signature showroom stay in the know email address subscribe email submitted error by entering your email, you are opting to receive updates from charles & colvard and agreeing to our terms of use and privacy policy. follow us ©2025 charles & colvard® terms of use privacy policy accessibility statement site map ©2025 charles & colvard® *discount not valid on signature collection, prior purchases, or other offers. unlock 10% offyour first order and get exclusive access to new arrivals, promotions, and more when you subscribe to email and text messages! email address: phone: let's be friends by submitting this form and signing up for texts, you consent to receive marketing text messages and emails (e. g. promos, cart reminders) from charles & colvard. consent is not a condition of purchase. msg & data rates may apply. msg frequency varies. unsubscribe at any time by replying stop or clicking the unsubscribe link (where available). terms of use privacy policy you're exclusive access is all set! shop now error chat with us ✕ we use cookies to personalize your experience on our site, measure the effectiveness of ads and web searches, and give us insights into user behavior so we can improve our communications and products. by clicking “agree”, closing this popup or continuing to browse, you indicate your agreement to our use of cookies per our cookie policy. agree accept selection opt out necessary analytics preferences marketing
