herein represent management's current judgment and expectations, our actual results may differ materially from those projected, stated or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to the company's ability to manage growth effectively, dependence on cree, inc. as the current supplier of the substantial majority of the raw material, ability to develop a material second source of supply, dependence on a limited number of jewelry manufacturing customers, dependence on continued growth and consumer acceptance of the company's products, in addition to the other risks and uncertainties described in more detail in our most recent annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur except as required
