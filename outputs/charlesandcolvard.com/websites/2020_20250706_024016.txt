when i discovered charles & colvard and read about moissanite i immediately knew it was the perfect stone for me! with no unethical human endangerment from mining or ecosystem destruction, i knew that moissanite was something i could be proud of for the rest of my life. valerie s. charles & colvard made the process extremely easy and answered all of my questions. we went over the environmentally friendly benefits of moissanite vs. a diamond, that is mined from the ground, and the fact that you could probably get a larger gem for a better price than a diamond, while still keeping - if not exceeding - the quality. jim r. my princess cut solitaire is absolutely stunning. the fire is unrivaled and the cut/ band are perfection. i couldn't possibly be happier. valerie & daryl my husband and i chose moissanite from the very beginning. a beautiful alternative to diamonds and for a fraction of the cost! micayla s. the quality of the charles and colvard rings far surpassed the others that i was looking at. to be honest i was a little nervous ordering something like this online without seeing it in person, but i was blown away by the beauty and quality of the craftsmanship of these rings. it was exactly what i could see on my future bride. ryan l. get inspired our sparkle in the wild. facebook insta twitter youtube pinterest free shipping, free returns† financing starting from 0% free returns† for 60 days warranty fast & free shipping company about us paying it forward as seen in leadership board of directors press releases investor relations careers brilliant rewards style & education customer care free shipping free returns † payment options customer reviews moissanite faq lab grown diamonds faq warranty service portal contact us live chat 877-202-5467mon - fri 9:00 am - 6:00 pm et trade partners trade portal authorized distributors wholesale resources where to buy find a store search helzberg diamonds macy's boscov's online shopping subscribe to our emails!
