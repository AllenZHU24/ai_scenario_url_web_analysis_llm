jewelry. they symbolize love, commitment, and one of the biggest milestones in any person's life. so as you begin to anticipate your proposal, your wedding and your life, we'd love to help you start it with a beautiful ring that exceeds your wildest dreams. if you're looking for moissanite engagement rings, good news, we invented it! if you're looking for lab-grown diamond engagement rings, we have an option to exceed your wildest dreams. from classic solitaire engagement rings to stunning and intricate styles, we have you covered. so, start your journey and find the perfect engagement ring that represents you and your marriage! the history of engagement rings did you know that prior to the year 1215 there was no such thing as a wedding engagement period? sure, wedding rings have been given since the ancient egyptians, who viewed rings as symbols of eternity, but the actual tradition of an engagement ring began in the year 1215. this happened when pope innocent iii declared that couples needed to wait between declaring they intend to be married and actually getting married. during this period a ring was given as a sign of intention to wed. the rest is history and the tradition lives on to this very day. the concept of using center stones in engagement rings has evolved over centuries. in 1477 the first known diamond engagement ring was used when archduke maximillian gave mary of burgundy the first known engagement ring with a diamond center stone. then for the next 500 years, diamonds were used quite sparingly until the fateful year of 1947. in that year the south african company de beers hired nw ayer, an advertising agency. a copy writer at that agency named frances gerety coined the slogan “a diamond is forever.” the success of this slogan, combined with the huge advertising budget behind it, pushed sales of diamond engagement rings to levels never before seen. nowadays though, because of ethical concerns and the huge price tag associated with diamonds, people are looking for alternative center stones. we here at charles and colvard offer two great options in the form of moissanite engagement rings and lab grown diamond engagement rings. moissanite engagement rings we here at charles and colvard know a thing or two about moissanite engagement rings. that’s because we literally invented them. we are the originators of using moissanite for engagement rings and we’ve been doing it for over 25 years. first though, let’s talk a little about our forever one™ moissanite.  moissanite is celebrated for its remarkable fire

it all off all of our engagement rings are made with recycled metal to make you feel even better about your choice. lab grown diamond engagement rings the beauty of a lab grown diamond engagement ring
