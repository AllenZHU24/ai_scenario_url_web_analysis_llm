rare, naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide, which was first discovered by the nobel prize-winning chemist dr. henri moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike in arizona. this intriguing new stone was named moissanite in his honor, and moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate this rare mineral in his laboratory. it wasn't until the late 90's that scientists - working in a research laboratory located in research triangle park, north carolina - developed the innovative thermal growing process that creates silicon carbide crystals. these crystals are fashioned into moissanite gemstones that rival any natural gemstone for fire and brilliance. these man-made gems are more durable than diamond, sapphire, ruby or emerald. is moissanite a brand of diamond or a simulated diamond?no. moissanite is not a substitute for diamond, either scientifically, chemically or emotionally. charles & colvard created moissanite is a unique gem with its own set of chemical and optical properties that exhibit more fire and brilliance than any other gemstone. moissanite manufacturing how does charles & colvard create moissanite?charles & colvard is the original creator of moissanite. the process is lengthy, complicated and expensive, which limits the output - it takes two to three months for the creation of a single gem. charles & colvard's manufacturing process and years of experience in creating the gemstone currently makes us a leading source and global distributor of created moissanite. in creating moissanite, what steps are taken to ensure the product is of the highest quality?years of development have led to a rigorous process for the production of created moissanite, which follows exacting specifications and very high standards of quality control. the charles & colvard certificate of authenticity certifies that every gem is an original product manufactured in meticulously controlled facilities by highly skilled specialists. post production, all created moissanite undergoes stringent testing for quality and purity, along with numerous rounds of grading before being released for sale. is moissanite an ideal cut stone?carefully and precisely faceted, each charles & colvard created moissanite gemstone is cut according to the exact angles and proportions specific to moissanite to maximize its brilliance and enhance its incredible fire. how is moissanite graded for clarity?charles & colvard employs graduate gemologists certified by the gemological institute of america. each charles & colvard gem is studied by trained grading specialists using a 10x jeweler's loupe for any inclusions that may affect moissanite's optical performance. moissanite characteristics how does moissanite compare to other gemstones on key gemological properties? the chart below compares moissanite with other popular gemstones, including diamond, ruby, emerald and sapphire, on key characteristics such as hardness, fire and brilliance. gemstone comparison chartbeauty brilliance refractive index (ri)fire dispersionhardness mohs scaledurability toughness charles and colvard created moissanite ® 2.65-2.69 0.104 9.25

twinned stones brilliance what property of moissanite makes it sparkle with such exceptional brilliance?the most significant optical property affecting a gemstone's brilliance, or sparkle, is the refractive index or ri. the ri of moissanite ranges from 2.65 to 2.69, meaning it displays more brilliance than diamond (with an ri of 2.42) or any other popular gemstone. will the brilliance of moissanite ever fade?no. charles & colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty which guarantees that every charles & colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its brilliance and fire forever. fire (dispersion) what gives moissanite its fire?a gemstone's fire is determined by a gemological property called dispersion. dispersion refers to the prism effect that occurs when pure white light enters a non-opaque object, breaks into spectral (rainbow) colors, and reflects back to the viewer. moissanite's dispersion is 0.104, which exceeds that of any gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. do other gemstones have more fire than moissanite?moissanite's fire exceeds that of any popular gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. fire can be measured scientifically; with a dispersion of 0.104, moissanite has 2.4 times the fire of diamond. no other gemstone or jewel compares to charles and colvard created moissanite® with regard to fire. will a moissanite gemstone ever lose its fire?no. charles & colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty which guarantees that every charles & colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its fire and brilliance forever. color & clarity will moissanite fade or change color over time?no. there are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite will be permanently changed. moissanite does undergo a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jeweler's torch during jewelry repair, but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage, and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools. is moissanite graded on the gia diamond color grading scale?there are three grades of moissanite available today: colorless (d-e-f range), near-colorless (g-h-i range) and with faint hues of color (j-k range). does moissanite have inclusions?yes. moissanite can have needle-like inclusions that can be seen under 10x magnification. however, they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone. it's worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion. they are unique characteristics, which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure. hardness (resistance to scratching) & toughness (resistance to breaking) is moissanite resistant to scratching?yes. moissanite is durable, tough and extremely resistant to scratching and abrasion. with a hardness of 9.25, moissanite is harder than all other gemstones except diamond. charles & colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty that protects against damage to the stone. does moissanite break easily?no. moissanite is one of the toughest known gemstones. studies in high pressure research have shown that moissanite is highly resistant to breaking and chipping. charles & colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty that protects against damage to the stone. is moissanite heat resistant?yes. moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones, including diamond. tests prove that at 2000ºf - higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire - moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created. this heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair. identifying moissanite how can moissanite be distinguished from other colorless gemstones? there are five (5) methods: determine if doubling of facet junctions is visible through magnification. use a jeweler’s loupe to examine the girdle of the stone.  forever one™ and forever brilliant® moissanite stones approximately 4.0mm and larger are engraved on the girdle for easy identification. examine for needle-like inclusions, typically perpendicular to the table facet, which are visible in moissanite under 10x loupe magnification. examine for specific refractive and gravity indices. have a trained gemologist or jeweler use a testing device specifically designed to distinguish moissanite from diamond. purchasing moissanite what is the difference between forever one ™, forever brilliant® and forever classic™ moissanite?charles & colvard forever one moissanite is a triumph of art, science and sustained effort. the structural configuration of this new moissanite material is what yields its unsurpassed, colorless (d-e-f) quality. while chemically it is still silicon carbide (sic), and its optical and hardness properties remain the same, it is the stacking of sic material in the manufacturing process that makes forever one moissanite unlike any of its predecessors. through its research and development efforts working with forever one, charles & colvard has developed a second grade of forever one, in g-h-i quality*. this near colorless gemstone emits a faint, icy hue compared to its forever brilliant predecessor, which yields a warm hue. this new, near-colorless gemstone is only currently available in limited quantities on the charles & colvardâ® e-commerce website, www.charlesandcolvard.com. forever brilliant moissanite falls within the prized, near-colorless g-h-i range. forever brilliant was developed through improvements to the crystal growing process from the original brand of charles & colvard created moissanite also known as forever classic. forever classic offers subtle color shades in the j - k range of the industry color scale, with faint undertones of green, yellow or gray. forever one d-e-f, forever brilliant and forever classic moissanite gemstones and jewelry will continue to be made available to wholesale distributors, manufacturers, retailers, tv shopping networks and designers. *based on the gemological institute of america's diamond grading scale. are fancy cuts available?yes. moissanite is available in various shapes and sizes. the most popular cut continues to be the round brilliant cut, and fancy cuts such as asscher, cushion, oval and square brilliant are available as well. why is moissanite sold by millimeter rather than by carat weight?the carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a diamond's weight. moissanite is not measured in carats because it weighs approximately 10 percent less than diamond. for example, a 6.5mm round diamond would weigh 1.0ct, while a 6.5mm round moissanite would weigh 0.88ct. the two stones would be the same size - 6.5mm in diameter. all stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight (dew) in carats. will moissanite retain its value over time?due to its rarity and unrivaled beauty, charles & colvard created moissanite is expected to retain or increase its value over time. moissanite repairs & care how should i care for my moissanite jewelry?you may clean moissanite the same way you would diamond or any other fine gemstone. as with any fine jewelry item, an ultrasonic cleaner can be used. however, it is best to be gentle with your valuable treasures. you can also clean your moissanite jewelry using a commercial (non-acid based) jewelry cleaner or with mild soap and water using a soft toothbrush. can moissanite withstand repairs and sizing?yes. moissanite is an extremely stable material. it is durable, tough and highly resistant to scratching, abrasion, breaking and chipping. its high heat tolerance makes moissanite very unlikely to experience damage during jewelry repair. can moissanite gemstones be re-set into new jewelry?yes. resetting your moissanite gemstone(s) into a new piece of jewelry can be done by an experienced jeweler. jewelry designers and manufacturers create their jewelry collections featuring many charles & colvard created moissanite using techniques very similar to those practiced by bench jewelers. can i engrave my moissanite stone?yes. you can engrave your moissanite stone after your purchase, after all, it is now a part of your personal story. please be aware that any engraving done post-purchase on the stone will void charles & colvard's limited lifetime warranty. free shipping, charles & colvard warranty. sign in favorites live chat email 877-202-5467 payment options gift cards charles & colvard warranty company the charles & colvard story
