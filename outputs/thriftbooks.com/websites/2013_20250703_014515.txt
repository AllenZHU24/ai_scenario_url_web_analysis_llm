wa with a commitment to provide quality cheap used books at the lowest prices anywhere. just two months after founding the company the first book was purchased and shipped: charlotte’s web by e. b. white for $4.74 thrift books has emerged from its modest beginnings to become the nation’s largest online seller of used books with a growing international presence. the thrift books’ marketplace has grown to include third party vendors such as green earth books, motor city books, the atlanta book company, books squared, yankee clipper books, blue cloud books, silver arch books and free state books. a national presence and anticipated future growth will ensure a continually growing selection of used books and even faster shipping to thrift books’ customers. innovation in processing and selling used books has allowed for thrift books to provide the internet’s cheapest prices without sacrificing our commitment to providing quality used books. its entire process of selling used books was developed internally using the latest technology and supply methods. thrift books has been featured in many publications including the wall street journal, the new york times, the seattle times, puget sound business journal and the software development times for their pioneering methods in online used book selling. thrift books’ commitment to using technology in used book selling is based on the desire to fulfill their motto to customers: spend less. read more. just seven years after its founding, the dividends are already apparent. today, you can purchase charlotte’s web from thrift
