books customer testimonials "dear thriftbooks, i had to write you about your service & speed. i'm disabled so i order many different things online several times a month. in this last month, i placed an order on one site & it took them a week to confirm my order & 2 weeks to ship it & send a tracking number. on another site, it took 2 weeks & 6 phone calls before i got a confirmation that they had even received my order & over 3 weeks to ship it. that was a week ago & i'm still waiting for a tracking number or a box. i placed an order with you last night, 2/12/13 @ 11:21 pst. you had confirmed & shipped my order 10 hours later! not only do you have great prices, every book i've ordered has come to me in better shape than how it was graded on your site. the follow-up from your sellers is also incredible. for the first time last night, i bought a bundle you offered from an author i've never read before. but, i can't wait to read them. you are by far absolutely the very best & most efficient site online, book & otherwise! i tell everyone about thriftbooks. even people i've just met in a store, looking at books! thanks again for another wonderful purchase & experience. sincerely, " juli | ca 02/13/2013 "a seemingly miraculous story is true! the book, miracle in maui arrived yesterday..... imagine my surprise when i flipped open to the fly-leaf and there was not only my wife’s signature, but our old phone number! she was astounded. it was indeed her old copy. she had leant it to someone when we lived in calgary, some ten years ago, and could not remember to whom. because she spoke fondly of the book i had decided for our anniversary to do a search for it and subsequently ordered it from you. she was grateful to get it as a surprise gift. but this retrieving of her original is rather special. all the way from auburn, washington!here’s to the miracle of old books!" richard | usa 10/02/2012 it's like christmas when i order for my classroom! everytime i open that orange package, my students want to know what we have to add to our library! shelli | usa 09/14/2012 thrift books is my virtual home when it's time to read. and when it's time to give books to every kid in myanmar, they are first in line with donations. john | usa 09/01/2012 i love your stores! i got just the books i wanted at a perfect price and had them here in no time. thanks! valerie | usa 12/04/2012 i just bought 11 of the 12 mary russell novels by laurie r. king (the 12th just came out, so it's not going to be available on tb yet) for under $40. quite a few of them were hardcover

expected. thank you so much for your excellent service! danielle | usa 12/18/2012 love this book site! found some of my old classics that i had given away to others! now i have replaced them in my library! yeah me! stella | tn 12/02/2012 thank-you thrift books. i ordered a book - which sadly never arrived. i emailed to let you know and after confirming no-one else could have picked it up, no forwarding was set up etc, you express-shipped a new copy to me - the same day. thank-you monica, and thank-you thrift books. awesome customer service! emma | usa 12/24/2012 page 1 of 5 1 2 3 4 5 next
