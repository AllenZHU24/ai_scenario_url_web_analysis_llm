why books  |  management thrift books was started in july 2003 in a small storage unit in kirkland, wa, with a commitment to provide quality cheap used books at the lowest prices anywhere. just two months after founding the company, the first book was purchased and shipped: charlotte’s web, by e. b. white, for $4.74. thrift books has emerged from modest beginnings to become the nation’s largest online seller of used books with a growing international presence. the thrift books family has expanded to include third party vendors such as green earth books, motor city books, the atlanta book company, books squared, yankee clipper books, blue cloud books, silver arch books, free state books, and sierra nevada books. a national presence and anticipated future growth will ensure a continually growing selection of used books and even faster shipping to thrift books customers. innovation in processing and selling used books has allowed thrift books to provide the internet’s cheapest prices without sacrificing our commitment to providing quality used books. our entire system of selling used books was developed internally using the latest technology and supply methods. thrift books has been featured for pioneering methods in online used book selling in many publications, including the wall street journal, the new york times, the seattle times, puget sound business journal and the software development times. thrift books’ commitment to using technology in used book selling is based on the desire to bring our motto to life for our customers: spend less. read more. as the company continues to grow and innovate, the dividends are apparent. today, you can purchase charlotte’s web from thrift books for even less than the day we started our company. website
