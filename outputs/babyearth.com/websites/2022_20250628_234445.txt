deliveries do not occur on sundays or holidays. orders placed before 1:00pm cst typically enter the system that day. although a package may be ready for delivery in the morning, orders do not enter 'shipped' status until the delivery company physically picks the package(s) up from our warehouse that afternoon.order changeschanges to orders cannot be made after 1:00pm cst on business days, as

once it has been placed. orders that ship directly from the baby earth warehouse must be cancelled by 1:00pm cst on their scheduled ship date. furniture and other items that require additional lead times may take us up to 72 hours to determine if we are able to grant your request. if we are unable to cancel the order prior to it entering the shipping process, you would need to return the item subject to our return policies below.alaska, hawaii, and po boxesnon-oversized shipments with alaska, hawaii, and p.o. box destinations incur the standard ground shipping charge but ship via u.s. postal service.returns we want you to be delighted with your babyearth.com purchase. most purchases can be returned within 30 days for a refund. just contact us for an rma number prior to return shipping. babyearth will cover the cost of return shipping for defective items, and will refund 100% of the purchase price. an unwanted, resalable item will be refunded 100% of the purchase price provided:1) it is returned with all original documentation and packaging.2) manufacturer tags are intact.3) it is in unused condition. returned items not meeting these criteria are subject to a 25% restocking fee. you will be responsible for shipping costs (each way) on unwanted items, and we recommend using a traceable method for your return shipping. certain products such as eating utensils, bottle feeding items / accessories, breast pumps, blankets, pillows, mattresses, diapers, potty seats, bath and fabric items and personal care items cannot be resold for hygienic reasons and are therefore non-refundable. items that are returned with missing pieces and/or parts will not be refunded and will be shipped back to the customer at the customer's expense.  you must notify us of damaged / defective products within 5 business days from the date of delivery. in the event that a product is defective or damaged in shipping, babyearth.com will provide an equivalent replacement item. in some cases, the manufacturer may opt to replace a defective part rather than replacing an entire item. if a replacement is not available, babyearth.com will issue a full refund including inbound and outbound shipping charges.the current flat rate shipping charge will be withheld from a return credit if the original order met the free shipping threshold, but exclusion of the returned item would have caused the order total to fall below the free shipping threshold. products returned without an rma are subject to a 25% restocking fee, due to additional processing costs caused by unexpected returns. we appreciate your help in keeping our costs and prices low!please send us an e-mail at service@babyearth.com to request an rma number or if you have any questions about our return policy. furniture and special order items in the event that you need to return furniture or special order items, you will be responsible for all shipping costs. this includes the cost to return the
