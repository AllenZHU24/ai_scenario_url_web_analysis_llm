the average age for the first breakthrough of the gums is when a child is between four and seven months old. as with anything else related to children's health and development, kids may sprout teeth either before or after this time, as it is a totally individual process. your baby will usually receive her bottom middle teeth first, then a top pair to match. these are followed by those in the back and on the sides, until there is a full set around age 2 or 3. some tell tale signs your baby is teething? be on the lookout for drooling, a swelling of the gums, an out of character fussy temperament and issues with eating and sleeping. while most babies get a little cranky during teething season, any extreme signs of sickness such as a fever or diarrhea should be reported immediately to your pediatrician, just to be on the safe side. the most common of comforts you can provide to your baby during this trying time is something firm or cold to chew on. many teething toys are available at your local toy store or baby supply shop for an extremely low price, such as the teething keys manufactured by nuby. these are filled with a non-toxic refreezable ice substance that keeps the keys cool and refreshing for baby's aching gums. teething nipples are also a great investment for the baby who is still drinking out of bottles while working their way toward solid food. they're available in three different flow rates, and helps to massage and soothe the gums during feeding times. for bedtime happiness, try a teething blanket , which allows little ones the opportunity to snuggle up with something warm and comforting, while also providing the all-important teething texture on its four corners. when your sweet baby gives way to an uncontrollable fussbucket, try to remember that teething is temporary, and it will all pass with time. try to comfort your youngster as best you can, providing things to chew on both at home and in the car, which will ease the process for you both! sort by: best sellersproduct name a to zproduct name z to aprice low to highprice high to low products displaying 1 to 12 (of 62 products) result pages:  1  2  3  4  5 ...  next >  all sophie the giraffe natural teetherby vulli$24.95  $18.95 (46 reviews) ships on wednesday! under the nile organic veggiesby under the nile organics$8.00  $7.00 multiple types (8 reviews) ships on wednesday! chan pie gnon natural teetherby vulli$14.99 multiple types (11 reviews) ships on wednesday! lifefactory silicone teether 2-packby lifefactory$12.95 multiple colors ships on wednesday! vanilla teething ring, 2 pkby vulli$8.99 multiple colors (11 reviews) ships on wednesday! natursutten bpa-free chill-it apple teetherby natursutten$11.75  $9.95 (2 reviews) ships on wednesday! fun ice chewy teethersby munchkin$1.95 multiple styles (3 reviews) ships on wednesday! organic teething blanketby dandelion$14.99 (4 reviews) ships on wednesday! raz-berry silicone teetherby razbaby$4.95 (22 reviews) ships on wednesday! ergo baby carrier organic sucking padsby ergo baby$20.00 (3 reviews) ships on wednesday! under the nile organic fruitsby under the nile organics$8.00  $7.00 multiple types ships on wednesday! natursutten natural rubber chill-it fish teetherby natursutten$11.75  $8.95 (3 reviews) ships on wednesday! displaying 1 to 12 (of 62 products) result pages:  1  2  3  4  5 ...  next >  all brandsbabyganics (1)boon (1)born free (2)bright starts (1)combi (3)dandelion (4)ergo baby (1)fisher-price (2)green sprouts (5)show more »hevea baby (1)infantino (1)kids preferred (1)lamaze (1)leachco (2)lifefactory (1)mam (1)manhattan toy (2)munchkin (3)natursutten (2)nuby (3)razbaby (4)rhino toys (1)sassy (8)the first years (1)under the nile organics (4)vulli (6)show less » 0 items orders over $99.00 ship free![add $99.00] baby health medical care diapering grooming oral care hygiene pacifiers teething maternity baby jogger city series bug canopy - singleshow all » about babyearth about us newsroom affiliate programs store location contact us quick link registry wish list my account sign in/register create an account order tracking email preferences policies shipping & returns institutional sales privacy policy stay connected! facebook twitter as seen on trusted seller bbb stella copyright © 2003-2012 wise innovations, inc. | conditions of use close trending articles family christmas traditions: how young is too young to start one?
