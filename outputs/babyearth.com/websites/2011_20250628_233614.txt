picks the package(s) up from our warehouse that afternoon. order changeschanges to orders cannot be made after 1:00pm cst on business days, as packages may already be en route to their destination(s). cancelling an orderat babyearth we take pride in processing your orders quickly. therefore, it may not always be possible to cancel your order once it has been placed. orders that ship directly from the babyearth warehouse must be cancelled by 1:00pm cst on their scheduled ship date. furniture and other items that require additional lead times may take us up to 72 hours to determine if we are able to grant your request. if we are unable to cancel the order prior to it entering the shipping process, you would need to return the item subject to our return policies below. expedited shipping optionsovernight and second day shipping options are subject to the pickup cycles of the carrier and business day limitations. for example, if you place an order on thursday evening and specify second day shipping, it will not arrive at its destination until the following monday. in this example, the next available departure is on friday evening, and the second day falls on a weekend. the following
