shipping & returns | baby earth skip to content shipping & returns covid-19 shipping delays we are still shipping from our warehouse as quickly as possible on most items, but please allow 2-3 additional days on certain items due to high demand and recently implemented covid-19 safety procedures. note that some shipments not sent directly from our warehouse, are subject to our partner’s policies. since we use ups for expedited shipments, we are bound to their policies and procedures. we designed our shipping options to be simple, affordable, and free with minimum purchase! we currently offer ups and fedex as preferred carriers. let us know if additional shipping options are important to you, and we'll add services as demand warrants. shipping rates shipping method order <

their destination. deliveries do not occur on sundays or holidays. orders placed before 1:00pm cst typically enter the system that day. although a package may be ready for delivery in the morning, orders do not enter 'shipped' status until the delivery company physically picks the package(s) up from our warehouse that afternoon.order changeschanges to orders cannot be made after 1:00pm cst on business days, as packages may already be en route to their destination(s).cancelling an orderat baby earth we take pride in processing your orders quickly. therefore, it may not always be possible to cancel your order once it has been placed. orders that ship directly from the baby earth warehouse must be cancelled by 1:00pm cst on their scheduled ship date. furniture and other items that require additional lead times may take us up to 72 hours to determine if we are able to grant your request. if we are unable to cancel the order prior to it entering the shipping process, you would need to

utensils, bottle feeding items / accessories, breast pumps, blankets, pillows, mattresses, diapers, potty seats, bath and fabric items and personal care items cannot be resold for hygienic reasons and

damaged / defective products within 5 business days from the date of delivery. in the event that a product is defective or damaged in shipping, babyearth.com will provide an equivalent replacement

inbound and outbound shipping charges.the current flat rate shipping charge will be withheld from a return credit if the original order met the free shipping threshold, but exclusion of the returned item would have caused the order total to fall below the free shipping threshold. products returned without an rma are subject to a 25% restocking fee, due to additional processing costs caused by unexpected returns. we appreciate your help in keeping our costs and prices low!please send us an e-mail at service@babyearth.com to request an rma number or if you have any questions about our return
