would you start painting or decorating the nursery with the extra headstart? according to the cbs early show, a texas-based company has created an at-home test kit product called “intelligender,” which can apparently determine the sex of a fetus in 10 minutes. though a simple urine sample test (retail cost approx. $30), the company claims expectant parents can get results that are up to 90% accurate. if you could find out the sex of your baby at 10 weeks, would it change the course of your welcoming-baby preparations? would you even want to know the sex at 10 weeks? comments (0)  //  add comment 22 may eco-proofing the nursery author: green treehouse  //  category: parenting you’ve heard about baby proofing. but what about eco-baby proofing? eco-proofing is the latest proactive effort to protect babies and reduce their exposure to environmental threats, especially those lurking in the nursery or house. eco-proofing a nursery involves taking a close look at the contents and surrounds of that room and eliminating risks. for example, new and expectant parents can eco-proof by opting for toys, furniture, and baby products that are known to be of harmful chemicals or compounds, such as phthalates, lead, and bisphenol a. to make eco-proofing easier, parents can look for “eco-friendly” products, many of which have labels to guide the eco-conscious (e.g., organic, bpa-free, certified lead free, etc.). they can also look to eco-friendly retailers, such as babyearth for eco-proofing ideas and environment-friendly baby gear advice. comments (0)  //  add comment 07 may gift certificates for mother’s day author: green treehouse  //  category: gift ideas new moms and mothers-to-be love gift certificates! i’m one of them. i love that “guilt-free” shopping experience that comes with gift cards. shopping with a gift card is like having a license to indulge, at least up to the limit of a card’s value! if you’re looking for a versatile, eco-friendly gift card for a new mom, click over to babyearth. comments (0)  //  add comment 24 apr moby wrap puts natural into baby wearing author: green treehouse  //  category: attachment parenting have you tried the moby wrap? i’ve always had a thing for baby carriers, so when my baby was born i couldn’t wait to try the moby wrap. though my baby ultimately showed preference for the ergo , i did enjoy giving the moby wrap a go. for parents who are looking for a natural and versatile carrying option, the moby wrap may be the ideal pick. it’s surprisingly simple in design–one piece of cloth, which is free of complicated snaps, buckles or fasteners. the best part, though, is that moby wrap keeps mom (or dad) and baby close. given that babies don’t stay babies for long, the snuggle factor alone scores moby a thumbs-up, at least in my book. comments (0)  //  add comment 20 apr gearing up for earth day author: green treehouse  //  category: green / earth friendly april 22, 2009, is earth day. pull out the red crayon and circle that date on your calendar! why? because it’s the perfect day for resolving to go green! you can jump start your earth day and green commitment with classy kid’s degradable diaper sacks. keep them in your diaper bag or within reach in the nursery. while ordinary plastic shopping bags may do the trick for containing dirty diapers, plastic takes years to break down in the landfill. these green diaper sacks break down and decompose quickly, making them a green, eco-friendly diaper disposal sack. comments (0)  //  add comment 30 mar a child who loves dolls author: green treehouse  //  category: toys though my mother hoped i would obsess over dolls as a child, i wasn’t all that into them. that’s far from the case with my own children. from the first time my girls could pick up a doll, they were hooked. true love at first sight. as a mother, i’ve enjoyed watching their love for dolls evolve. at first, there was the baby cuddle doll and then there was the gloworm—gee, that was such a hit with my older daughter. she refused to sleep without it. the gloworm love gradually faded, replaced by the discovery of a dressy-type doll, which was later tossed for a baby doll that needed diaper changes because she could wet her diaper. i admit that once i started spending more money on doll (newborn) diapers than i did on those for my own living and breathing children, i did try to encourage cabbage patch doll adoption, but that only backfired. now while my younger child is at the gloworm stage, my older child is quickly falling for barbies, american girls, and friends forever girls. while i try to let my girls steer their love for dolls and interests, i admit that i’ve said “no” to the purchase of a few types (brands) of dolls along the way. frankly, i just don’t want my girls to grow up any sooner than necessary. thankfully, american girl dolls and friends forever girls seem to have staying power, at least for now, though my daughter appears to increasingly favor her friends forever doll. i guess that’s because the doll looks like a friend she could find in real life, minus the eye liner. it’s dressed in trendy clothing, similar to outfits my daughter likes to wear, but the clothing is age-appropriate (no micro-minis here…a huge thanks to a company that got it right…oh by the way, the doll packaging is eye candy for moms–no zipties!). i appreciate how these two doll companies try to promote positive self-esteem, responsibility and self-confidence. for example, friends forever girls come with an inspiring book (my child’s doll, natalie, arived with a book that tackles how to deal with feelings) and a special “butterfly promise” card. if you’re curious, each letter in the word butterfly stands for a powerful girl message (e.g., b, “be the best i can be”; u, “use kindness and be fair”, t, “tell the truth”…). in today’s society, girls definitely need all the positive messages they can get. when they find a doll they love, those messages really seem to soak in. given what i know about my children’s love of dolls and the speed in which their interests wane, i hope they continue to obsess over dolls that love them back for a long time to come. comments (0)  //  add comment 29 mar recall: fisher-price 3-in-1 high chairs author: green treehouse  //  category: recalls march 24, 2009: the consumer product safety commission (”cpsc”) has announced a voluntary recall of about 24,000 fisher-price 3-in-1 high chairs (”3-in-1 high chair to booster”). the recall involves product number (p5369), which is printed on the side of the seat, on a label on the seat pad, and on the productâ€™s packaging. the high chairs were sold exclusively at target from december 2008 through march 2009. according to cpsc, “the seat can fall backwards from high chair frame if the booster seat release is unlatched while the child is in the product. also, the seat back can detach if not fully snapped in place, posing a fall hazard and risk of serious injury to young children.” at least one serious injury has been reported. consumers are advised to discontinue use immediately. for more information about this recall or to determine whether your high chair is involved in this recall, click here. comments (0)  //  add comment 24 mar follow babyearth on twitter author: green treehouse  //  category: babyearth news want to be the first to know about the newest baby gadgets and gear, eco-friendly products, and great deals?

probably not, suggests a spokeperson the organization. “our intention is not to alarm parents, but to inform parents that products that claim to be gentle and pure are contaminated with carcinogens, which is completely unnecessary.” what can parents do? start reading labels and pay close attention to product marketing. look for products that clearly state what they do and don’t include. ‘natural’ may no longer cut it. instead, look for other descriptions, such as organic, sustainably grown ingredients, no masking agents, no sodium lauryl sulfate, no parabens, clear formula chemicals or no fragrance. stick with the old warning, “if you can’t pronounce an ingredient on a label, look for another product.” also, be on the look out for companies that have demonstrated a commitment to the safety of children’s products time and time again, such as companies that were built around the “organic” and “environmental health” concepts. comments (0)  //  add comment « previous entries categories babyearth news contests gift ideas parenting attachment parenting babies behavior green baby names health & wellness just for dads nutrition preschoolers relationships single parenting the green nursery toddlers parenting bookshelf products bath & body car seats carriers clothing & shoes crib mattresses cribs & bedding green / earth friendly pacifiers / teethers safety strollers toys recalls reviews travel uncategorized blogroll babyearth babyearth on facebook babylicious bornfree ergobaby graco blog haba healthy child blog healthy child, healthy world kiwi blog little twig moby wrap naturepedic pbs parents sigg skip*hop blog toy hazard recall list u.s. consumer product safety commission get the twitter widget widget and many other great free widgets at widgetbox!
