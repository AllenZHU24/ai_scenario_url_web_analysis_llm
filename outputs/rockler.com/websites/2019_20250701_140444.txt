pulls project hardware cabinet hardware furniture hardware diy home improvement projects rockler began as a mail-order woodworking supply company in the 1950s. among the first products featured in our catalogs were hardware items such as knobs, pulls, hinges and table and drawer slides. almost sixty years later, we offer one of the widest selections of hardware you can find. here's a sample of what we offer: drawer slides:our lineup includes options for every application and every budget. economical euro roller slides and smooth-operating ball-bearing slides. slides that mount on the sides of the drawers and slides that mount underneath, out of sight. slides with 3/4 extension, full extension and over-travel capacity. slides that can lend your project a certain "wow factor" by opening with just a touch, closing softly on their own or doing both. and anchoring all these options are our centerline lifetime slides, which are backed by a limited lifetime warranty. knobs and pulls: you'll find thousands of options in a huge variety of styles and finishes, including brass, copper, stainless steel, bronze, nickel and – of course – wood. we also offer specialized jigs to make installation a breeze. hinges:we carry hinges for just about any application – inset and overlay hinges, concealed european-style hinges and decorative tipped hinges, full mortise and wrap-around hinges, piano hinges and lid-holding torsion hinges. we've got specialty hinges for small boxes, hinges that will close a cabinet door softly and hinges made specifically for shutters. if you're not sure what you need, snap a photo of the location and send it to support@rockler.com for expert advice from our tech services department. storage and organization:we have innovative and elegant solutions to help you maximize your space in your kitchen, your pantry, your laundry room, your closet, your garage and more. we also offer specialized lighting products, an array of fasteners and a large selection of
