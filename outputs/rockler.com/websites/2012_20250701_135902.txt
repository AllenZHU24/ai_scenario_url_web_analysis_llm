reviews "every time i have been in a rockler store around the country i have left feeling that i received wonderful service and most always had exactly what i needed in stock at a fair to great price. the only complaint, if it can be called that, is that i have to drive over 45 minutes to reach the nearest rockler store. my wife probably appreciates that distance, as i am certain that if one was as close as i wished it to be, we would have very little left in our checkbook!" - larry matthews - 02/17/2012 see more... customer care customer service faqs find a store sign up for our e-mail request
