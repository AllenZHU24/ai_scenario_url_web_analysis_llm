in 1998, we decided to reflect our commitment to offering hard–to–find hardware (in addition to kits, tools, lumber and our exclusive shop table line) by changing the name of both our retail and catalog operations to rockler woodworking and hardware. customers are constantly telling us how happy they are that they know they'll be able to get the full–extension slides, restoration knobs, elbow catch or other specialized hardware they need to complete their project. we have been on the web since 1996, and are reaching more woodworkers than ever before! whether you're a seasoned pro, a home–improvement enthusiast or a craftsperson, we believe you will enjoy browsing our online catalog, getting interesting tips through our email newsletter, and being the first to find out about some exciting new products!  we are constantly on the lookout for new ways to make all your projects as fulfilling as they can be. sincerely, ann rockler jackson, ceo "i became disabled three years ago and had the hardest of times to find what i needed for my shop. but not now. you've got everything i can think of. thank you!
