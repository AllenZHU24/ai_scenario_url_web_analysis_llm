dust right 4'' elbow tool port ross - paradise, ca (aug 9, 2011) fit well on my pm-2000 tablesaw. the double hose clamps make for a good tight fit. the plastic is in two halves and could break if torqued or twisted with force. overall good product and price. lapcon cabinet lid support peggy - columbus, ms (aug 9, 2011) i used this with a 1/2" overlay door. i marked the position of the mounting plate at the end of the lifting arm while the door was in the "up" position. this required me to remove the door to install the mounting plate, but that wasn't a problem with the hinges i was using similar to 37199. works like a champ. pro tapered countersink bits bill - clemmons, nc (aug 9, 2011) first let me say that this is a rockler brand product. it doesn't specify this in the online description. i didn't realize this until i received the item. nothing against rockler branded products. i have a number of rockler branded products that i'm happy with. but i wanted a very high quality set and was willing to pay for it. with all that said i'm happy with the countersinks created with these. occasionally i have some very minor tearout that i can fix easy enough so i can live with it. i will also mention that the 3 piece rockler plug cutter set cuts plugs that fit perfectly in these countersink holes. i would recommend this set. square check for tape measures john - lexington, ky (aug 9, 2011) i had really high hopes for this little gadget. i thought it was going to solve a lot of my measuring troubles. first of all, the piece would not stay attached to my measuring tape and secondly, it would not stay on the corner of the project. it actually made measuring more frustrating than before i tried on several occassions to use it, thinking i might have just been in a hurry or wasn't using it properly or something. every single time i got the same results. aa battery 4-pack scott - st. paul, mn (aug 9, 2011) seeing the sale price on these, i was concerned that these may be older batteries. i was very happy to see that the expiration date on mine were 2017! fastcap procarpenter flatback ps-16 tape measure paul fletcher - indianapolis, in (aug 8, 2011) i bought my fast cap flatback sae tape a few years ago. i have not used it much, although, it is a great concept and every woodworker needs one. we have treated this tape well and given it the good care that all our tools deservel. i recently also bought a metric version of this tape. the problem with my sae flatback tape is that it was not durable. it recently refused to recoil back into its case. no adult in my family could fix it. there are no children. in desperation, i finally had to toss it. i have ordered another one, mainly because my 49-year-old daughter uses it every time we woodwork together, usually about 2-3 times per month. i consider it a necessity and so does she. it's just that good. but, i wish it had lasted longer. because of the short life of this tape, i consider it only fair. go ahead and buy one, it is a nice tool, but, you may be throwing it away sooner than you think. sure-foot plus™ 3/4'' pipe clamp kevin veldhuisen - chipley, fl (aug 8, 2011) the clamps themselves are excellent and i will definitely buy more as the need arises. however, avoid the pipes! i purchased 4 of their zinc pipes and after 3 clampings i already need to replace 3 of the 4 pipes because i actually ripped the pipe apart at the threadings from the force i applied to the clamps. i'm not a big guy, so this is extremely disappointing for that product, and while i have to admit my ego was nicely boosted at the same time, that still doesn't help with my woodworking projects. 4-1/4'' reach hold-down clamp bruce melton - roling prairie, indiana (aug 8, 2011) this is the first hold fast clamp that i have used and i now will not do without one. i have been using it on a bed project on 8/4 oak chopping mortises and it is holding very well. i have not experienced any paint coming off nor breakage and i have wacked the clamp hard! wood mallet the clamp releases with just a tap. with what i know now i'd purchase another one. pocket hole® joinery clamp mark richards - brighton, co (aug 8, 2011) honestly, this clamp isn't at all what i thought it was. first off, it doesn't fit into the pocket flush, so you can't rely on it to keep your frame flush. as such, you have to clamp it separately, which defeats the purpose. second, the little white peg is a soft plastic, and bends easily, so you can't clamp down tightly. i wish i knew why other people reviewing this like it, but i wish i had never wasted my money. i'll probably never take them out of the storage drawer again. editor's note: backing out the pin will correct this issue. viewing 1 through 10 of 100 next "i have made many orders from rockler. each one was recieved timely and many were free shipping. the detail specs on almost everything is unbelievable. i have never been disappointed. good work rockler." - jerry hamann - 03/26/2011 see more... customer care customer service find a store sign up for our email request a free catalog suggest a new product privacy policy product info woodworking blog learn faqs search woodworking  product reviews product index search msds rss feeds company info about rockler contact us careers affiliate program request professional catalog rockler news school program custommade also visit: copyright © 2011, rockler companies, inc. this is a secure shopping site web1
