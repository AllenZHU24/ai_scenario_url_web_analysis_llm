hand of the user during operation. most handheld scanners are designed like a handgun, with a grip and a trigger to activate the scanning operation, but the term "handheld barcode scanner" also refers to scanners that are better known as mobile computer, which have their own full-blown operating system running. our handheld scanners can be corded, cordless, 1d, 2d, or connected to a ios/android smartphone/tablet. for assistance with choosing the right handheld scanner, or to request a quantity discount, contact one of our scanner experts. get help from a barcoding expert! what type of
