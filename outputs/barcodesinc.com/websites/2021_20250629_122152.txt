please contact us if you would like a shipping quote, or have any questions. address verification/alternate shipping address address verification is a precautionary measure we take to ensure your safety and prevent fraud. phone and online shopping does not allow us to request traditional forms of identification, e.g. a driver's license, like a standard walk-in retail outlet. instead we conduct address verification though your credit/debit card issuer to confirm your identity and verify the validity of your purchase, thereby ultimately protecting your credit. both your billing and shipping addresses are verified before an order ships. if you would like to ship to an address other than your billing address, it is best to contact your card issuing bank and have your shipping address added as an alternate shipping address to your card. simply let the card issuer know that you are placing a phone/online order and the retailer needs to verify the address before shipment to eliminate the possibility of fraudulent activity. orders with the same billing and shipping address or an alternate shipping address recognized by the card issuer will ship the quickest. case studies testimonials
