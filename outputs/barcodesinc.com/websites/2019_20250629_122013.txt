instead of cash, credit card readers (also known as msr or magstripe readers) are an essential part of any pos system. our credit card readers are designed to read the information encoded in the magnetic stripe located on the back of a card or badge. many of our msrs are even used to read driver’s licenses, gift cards, loyalty cards, membership cards, and other ids. fixed options exist for stationary systems and mobile readers are available for on-the-go devices - with iphone, ipad, and android compatibility. simply choose a usb or serial connection type, plug it in, and start scanning cards into your application. we also have a full line of emv-compliant payment terminals. questions? 1-800-351-9962 chat email name* email* phone (for fastest response) company* message i need to ship
