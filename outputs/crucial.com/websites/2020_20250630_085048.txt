remember, checking the socket isn’t always enough. before buying the latest processor, make sure it is compatible with the motherboard you've chosen. also, not having the right cpu can affect the speed of your memory as in limiting it’s performance. 3. feed speed-hungry cpus with dram! many new amd® and intel® processors feed on high-speed ddr4 memory. the more memory speed the processor has to work with, the higher its output. as a result, you get a faster, more responsive rig. remember, you're memory must be compatible with your cpu and motherboard. 4. what’s up with my memory speed? if you buy a kit that’s rated at 2400 mt/s, you should make sure you’re getting all the speed you bought! always check the memory speeds after building your rig since you might need to enter the bios and load the memory profile. the ballistix® m.o.d. utility and other third-party apps can show you the speed at which your system is using your memory. 5. ram installation ram sticks, or dimms, can only go one way, so ensure they’re aligned before applying any force while installing them. we don’t want an accidental hulk smash moment. see how to install memory in your desktop or laptop with one of our online guides, or follow the instructions from the manufacturer. 6. paste is important! new builders may not be aware of the importance of heat paste in a custom rig, but it is a basic necessity that is quick and easy to apply. first, remember to always put paste on top of the cpu, never underneath it! we recommend using a pea-sized drop for perfect adhesion. too much (within reason) won't hurt but it will make a mess. not enough may be insufficient for the proper heat transfer. 7. mistakes happen do not forget the i/o shield. it probably won’t happen on one of your first rigs as you double- and triple-check everything, but as you go forward and you get used to building systems, you may forget the i/o shield. totally happened to a friend, of course. (oops!) 8. why you need an 80 plus rating on the power supply you want a power supply that won’t let you down! that’s why there are the 80 plus certifications and each one has different criteria around the efficiency of the power supply. here are the different levels of certification, in order from basic to highest quality: 80 plus 80 plus bronze 80 plus silver 80 plus gold 80 plus platinum 80 plus titanium the higher the efficiency certificate, the higher the standards of the power supply. they also have other features like over-current protection (ocp) and over-voltage protection (ovp) that will keep your system safe. keep in mind that a semi-modular or fully modular power supply will make the cable management easier! 9. cable management half the fun in building your pc is actually putting it together. and of course, you want it to look nice and clean, right? cable management helps with making it look nice and tidy, and in some cases, it can even improve system cooling since you get better airflow inside the chassis! 10. to overclock or not to overclock? well, that depends on you! to many, the possibility of burning out your rig and its components isn’t worth the risk, and you’ll void your parts’ warranties. but, if you want to push your rig to its absolute performance edge, there are tons of guides online to assist you in tuning your system. the moment of truth building a pc is a unique experience and it requires time. all that effort we spend finding the right components and putting them together – it all leads to that moment of anxiety, having us wonder. . .  will it actually boot?! happy building! ©2017 micron technology, inc. all rights reserved. information, products, and/or specifications are subject to change without notice. neither crucial nor micron technology, inc. is responsible for omissions or errors in typography or photography. micron, the micron logo, crucial, and the crucial logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of micron technology, inc. microsoft and windows are either registered trademarks or trademarks of microsoft corporation in the united states and/or other countries. nvidia and sli are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of nvidia corporation in the u.s. and other countries. amd crossfire is a trademark of amd. all other trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective owners. × 5% discount on your next order! sign up today to receive your welcome offer. about warranty email preferences privacy terms of sale terms of use environmental © 2020 micron technology, inc. all rights reserved
