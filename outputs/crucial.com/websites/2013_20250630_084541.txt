diligently to design, develop, and market products that reduce environmental impact and ensure materials used in our processes do not pose a potential hazard to our employees, customers, or the environment. we strive for this through the entire life cycle of our products. in addition to testing our products for regulatory compliance, we also meet the requirements of prominent globally recognized standards such as rohs and weee. here, we minimize the use of hazardous materials as well as offer our customers ways to properly dispose of and recycle products. the legislative environment is continuing to change, expand, and evolve. rather than ignore it or see it as an added burden, we embrace it as part of our responsibility of being good corporate citizens. we have offered lead-free products and rohs compliant products for several years and in 2008, we began to offer halogen-free products as well. as more states and countries pass recycling and hazardous material legislation, we will work to ensure our products meet the ongoing requirements. rohs/weee compliance statement rohs directive (2011/65/eu) the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/ec (also known as the restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs) was adopted by the european union in february 2003, and took effect in july 2006. this was superseded by 2011/65/eu which took effect in january 2013. the rohs directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. it affects manufacturers, sellers, distributors and recyclers of electrical and electronic equipment containing lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, polybrominated biphenyl (pbb) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (pbde). after july 1, 2006, the use of these materials was banned in new products sold in europe. additionally, the use of decabde (decabromodiphenil ether), was banned on july 1, 2008. all micron consumer products group products and their packaging materials sold and/or imported into the european union are fully compliant.* * we recognize that certain industries have received exemptions from the rohs directives. these products have always been 5/6 rohs compliant, meaning they contain pb solder, but otherwise comply with rohs regulations (they meet five of six stipulations). if you are a eu customer and have a rohs exemption and prefer leaded (as opposed to lead free) product please contact your sales representative. note that many of our products contain electronic ceramic passive parts that may use lead-oxides which are exempt from the directive (see article 4, annex iii, item 7(c)-i of the annex thereto). products manufactured prior to 10/29/2010 will also claim the 7(c)-iii exemption. if you have questions on whether or not a specific part number claims these exemptions, please contact your sales representative. the rohs legislation, and some applicable faqs can be found here: http://www.rohs.eu/english/legislation/rohs-legislation.html http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf weee directive (2002/96/ec) the rohs directive is closely linked with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive (weee) 2002/96/ec, which defines collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to address the problem of electronic waste. the weee directive / regulations apply to companies that manufacture, sell, distribute, recycle, or treat electrical and electronic equipment, as well as to consumers in the european community. according to the weee directive, there are ten categories of electrical and electronic equipment (eee) including: large household appliances (e.g. washing machines, cookers) small household appliances (e.g. toasters, irons, hairdryers) it and telecommunications equipment (e.g. pcs, copiers, phones, mobiles) consumer equipment (e.g. tvs, videos, hi-fis) lighting equipment (e.g. fluorescent lamps, but excludes filament lightbulbs) electrical and electronic tools (e.g. lawnmowers, sewing machines, drills) toys, leisure and sports equipment (e.g. video games, bike computers, slot machines) medical devices, except implanted and infected products (e.g. ventilators, analysers) monitoring and control instruments (e.g. smoke detectors, thermostats) automatic dispensers (e.g. drinks dispensers, chocolate dispensers, atms) while there are many different materials that go into creating eee, many products contain valuable metals and resources that need to be recycled and some products contain materials, components and substances which can be dangerous to the environment and harmful to human health if proper treatment does not take place at the product's end of life. products labeled with the symbol of a crossed-out wheeled bin as shown below are eee (see below). the crossed-out wheeled bin denotes that weee must not be disposed of with the remainder of unseparated household waste, but should instead be collected separately and managed in an environmentally sound manner. depending on your location, weee can be returned free of charge by any person to recycling stations, from retailers who sell eee when a 'like for like' product (i.e. the same type of product) is purchased, other collection sites, or it may be collected directly from the households. for more detailed product take-back information, please refer to our country specific contacts listed below. as a european consumer, you are not allowed to dispose of weee together with your household waste. while it is primarily the distance seller's obligation to collect weee free of charge, on delivery of a new 'like for like 'product, it is the consumer's responsibility to ensure that their weee is not disposed of in regular household waste. you should instead use the designated collection points, equipment collection schemes or you can simply return your product directly to the producer or retailer where you originally purchased your equipment if you are buying a new 'like for like' model. in this way, the environmental impact associated with disposal of weee is reduced and there will be more opportunity for reusing, recycling and recovering weee. micron consumer products group is dedicated to minimizing the impact our products have on the environment, and micron consumer products group customers can return products free of charge to us for recycling or can bring their equipment back to where they purchased it when they buy a replacement or upgrade. the european weee directive and some applicable faqs can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf although european member state implementation of the weee directive is similar in nature, the actual requirements and collection schemes vary from country to country. as more states and countries both within and outside of the eu pass recycling legislation, micron consumer products group will continue offer take-back schemes in these countries. here are all the schemes we are currently registered with. included is the identification of the scheme, their address and contact information, and website information where consumers can learn how to return their weee for recycling free of charge. country scheme contact info website to recycle your product comments austria erp
