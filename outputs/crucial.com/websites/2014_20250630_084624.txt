performing this update. this firmware update process is done entirely at your own risk. if performed correctly, there will be no loss of system or user data on the drive. however, if the firmware process is interrupted for any reason, your solid state drive may not function properly. if this update is done on a notebook computer, it is strongly recommended that power be supplied by the ac power adapter. version compatible products download mu05 crucial m500 ssd (all form factors) windows® 7 updater application download firmware instruction guide manual boot file for windows and mac® download firmware instruction guide release date: 03/25/2014 firmware for the m500 (all form factors) is being updated from version mu03 to mu05. the m500 is updateable to this new firmware starting from previous versions using tools provided by micron. this update will be mandatory cut-in for new product built in micron factories, and is an optional update for any drive in the field. for end users, it is recommended if the user is experiencing or wishes to prevent an issue related to the following items. version mu05 includes the following changes: improved drive latency performance in applications with smart polling improved compatibility with 3rd party encryption management software corrected reporting of smart attribute 196 and 183 increased thermal throttling response on 960gb capacity for greater reliability corrected upgrade issues experienced on mu03 by some customers numerous bug fixes and stability improvements additional details can be found in the firmware guide

entirely at your own risk. before initiating the update process be sure to backup or make copies of all important files. if the firmware process is interrupted your solid-state drive may not function properly. uefi-based systems: during validation of this firmware update we noticed instances where our update tools do not recognize the ssd with some systems using uefi. the target device is not recognized as an updateable device during the reboot process. if this happens, the firmware update will not occur, and you’ll retain the firmware version you started with. windows will then restart normally. if this sequence occurs, you cannot upgrade to this firmware version at this time, but you’ve done no harm to your system (or your data). if you have a dual boot system we recommend using the manual boot process as opposed to the windows update utility. if you have more than one m4 in your system, note that the windows update utility will update all eligible drives automatically. with the manual boot file you will be prompted on which drive(s) you want to update. if you have questions or need assistance, please contact our technical support department. version compatible products

file for windows and mac® download firmware instruction guide release date: 04/02/2013 firmware 070h is recommended for anyone currently running 040h or previous firmware releases. it includes incremental improvements and refinements over these versions which may improve the overall user experience. like recent firmware versions, version 070h has improvements over versions 000f which are specific for windows 8 and new ultrabook systems, although systems running windows 7 and other operating systems may also see improvements. any m4 firmware version will function normally in windows 8, even without these performance improvements. the following is a summary of changes between 040h and 070h, which are independent of operating system: resolved a power-up timing issue that could result in a drive hang, resulting in an inability to communicate with the host computer. the hang condition would typically occur during power-up or resume from sleep or hibernate. most often, a new power cycle will clear the condition and allow normal operations to continue. the failure mode has only been observed in factory test. the failure mode is believed to have been contained to the factory. this fix is being implemented for all new builds, for all form factors, as a precautionary measure. the fix may be implemented in the field, as desired, to prevent occurrence of this boot-time failure. to date, no known field returns have been shown to be related to this issue. a failure of this type would typically be recoverable by a system reset. additional details can be found in the
