you must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). we use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. if we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. surveys or contests we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. if you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. the requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code). we use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), or to send participants an email newsletter. we may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. share with a colleague and project lists if you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague about our site, we will ask you for your colleague’s name and email address. we will automatically send your colleague a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. crestline stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. your colleague may contact us at info@crestline.com to request that we remove this information from our database. communications from the site special offers, updates and newsletters we will occasionally send out information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. you can sign up for these emails from us on every page of the site. out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. service-related announcements we will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. for instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. if you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. customer service based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. we will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. we will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. profile we store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and clear gifs to create a “profile” of your preferences. we tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. information sharing and disclosure aggregate information (non-personally identifiable) we do not share aggregated demographic information about our user base. this

parties to provide software and hosting services for our site. we do not share any personally identifiable information with these service providers. legal disclaimer we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site choice/opt-out we provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. for example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference. if you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by indicating such on the ‘email signup’ page. log files as is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. this information includes internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (isp), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. we use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. we do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. we employ a third-party tracking service (omniture) that uses log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. cookies a cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. we use cookies on this site. we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. we do not use session specific cookies on this site. a session cookie expires when you close you browser. a persistent cookie remains on your

this privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. clear gifs (web beacons/web bugs) we employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. in contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. we do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. we may use clear gifs in our html-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. this allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. if you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “choice/opt-out.” links to other sites this web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by crestline. please be

important to us. when you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (ssl). we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. if you have any

any time, so please review it frequently. if we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. contact us if you have any questions
