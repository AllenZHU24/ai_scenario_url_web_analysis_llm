difference here. do promotional items work? yes, promotional items do work to build brand awareness and a positive reputation for companies.according to the ppai consumer study report: 60% of respondents would look up a brand they didn’t know much about if they received a promotional product from them. 83% said promotional products would strengthen their loyalty to brands they currently shop with. 73% said repeated exposure to a kept promotional product from a brand would make them more likely to consider that bread for a future purchase.though the type of product a company hands out determines the marketing strategy’s success, in general, people love receiving gifts and will happily use them. the more the products are used, the more potential customers will learn about your brand!to see the best results when giving away promotional items, it’s important to choose products that are practical, but desirable.check out our top sellers for trending swag and new products for ideas that will get noticed by your target audience. what are the most effective promotional products? the most effective promotional products are items that are exciting to receive and that encourage the recipient to use them often. when choosing branded items, a company should consider which products their target audience is most likely to use in their day-to-day lives to ensure the largest number of people learn about their brand messaging.effective promotional products vary from company to company, for example: a dentist may give out branded toothbrushes. a brewery may be successful handing out bottle openers that feature their logo. a gym might choose to give out custom water bottles because their customers are likely active and drink water frequently to rehydrate. a veterinarian might hand out branded pet products because they’re more likely to be seen by other pet owners at a park or pet store.it’s important to choose promotional products based on the hobbies and interests of your target audience. what if i don’t have a logo or want help with a design? our graphic design team can take an old logo or even just your design ideas and create something stunning
