energy system and produce 100% of our power from our solar panels. additionally, our building is leed (leadership in energy and environmental design) certified at the gold level. our office renovation was designed to allow more natural light to come through windows and skylights and we added led lights to reduce our consumption of electricity. we also installed new energy-efficient walls and ceilings, and a new, high-efficiency natural gas heating system.our shipping practices are carbon neutral, meaning that we offset carbon emissions by purchasing credits toward green projects:
