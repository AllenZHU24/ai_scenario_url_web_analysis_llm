yes, promotional items do work to build brand awareness and a positive reputation for companies.according to the ppai 2023 consumer study report: 60% of respondents would look up a brand they didn’t know much about if they received a promotional product from them. 83% said promotional products would strengthen their loyalty to brands they currently shop with. 73% said repeated exposure to a kept promotional product from a brand would make them more likely to consider that bread for a future purchase.though the type of product a company hands out determines the marketing strategy’s success, in general, people love receiving gifts and will happily use them. the more the products are used, the more potential customers will learn about your brand!to see the best results when giving away promotional items, it’s important to choose products that are practical, but desirable.check out our top sellers for trending swag and new products for ideas that will get noticed by your target audience. what are the most effective promotional products? the most effective promotional products are items that are exciting to receive and that encourage the recipient to use them often. when choosing branded items, a company should consider which products their target audience is most likely to use in their day-to-day lives to ensure the largest number of people learn about their brand messaging.effective promotional products vary from company to company, for example: a dentist may give out branded toothbrushes. a brewery may be successful handing out bottle openers that feature their logo. a gym might choose to give out custom water bottles because their customers are likely active and drink water frequently to rehydrate. a veterinarian might hand out branded pet products because they’re more likely to be seen by other pet owners at a park or pet store.it’s important to choose promotional products based on the hobbies and interests of your target audience. what if i don’t have a logo or want help with a design? our graphic design team can take an old logo or even just your design ideas and create something stunning. our designers work with logos day in and day out, so they’ve seen the good, the bad, and sometimes even the ugly. they know exactly what makes an effective design and can transform what you have or create something completely new! tell us what your goals are and we’ll do the rest. how do i request a free sample? samples are the best way to review items before you place an order. crestline provides free samples to customers up to

from material defects, or crestline will issue you a refund. because our products are customized, we cannot accept returns, outside of material defects, on products once printed with your design. if an issue arises with your order, our expert resolutions team will make it right. what is a setup charge? a setup charge is a fee that our factories require to set up a screen to create each custom imprint. the amount is dependent on the item(s) being ordered. if the item is being re-ordered and the artwork is staying the same, you will not pay another setup charge. if the item is a new item, you will be charged a setup charge, as our factory will have to create a new customized screen, unless there is a free setup promotion on the item. what are promotional products? promotional products are branded items that companies can customize with their logo, slogan, or any other identifier. giving away promotional products at stores, company events, trade shows, or job fairs is a tried and true marketing tactic that increases brand awareness and attracts potential customers.whatever you call promotional items, be it swag, goodies, corporate gifts, giveaways, tchotchkes, merch, promo, or freebies, these items are a budget-friendly way to build brand awareness and ensure that recipients have a lasting, positive reminder of your brand.what can promotional products do for my
