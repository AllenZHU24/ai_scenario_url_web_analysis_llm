items"students had great fun with the stress dude. great idea for finals stress. students loved the color change. held up to multiple squeezes." – janet, ga"with everyone shaking hands coming by our booth, everyone was pleased to walk away with a hand sanitizer, and the imprint looks great. the hand sanitizer is good as it is one item that users can carry around with them during the winter season." – david, nj"it is great to be able to send patients home with a quality ice pack with our clinic's logo printed. they keep cold for a reasonable amount of time. the size options of the packs were just right. the packs fit very well in our take-home bags we give patients. i also like that each ice pack is individually wrapped in a plastic bag." – misha, fl"the lip balm leaves your lips feeling smooth and protected from the wind, sun, or the dry air encountered in a conference center. the cherry-vanilla flavor is subtle. it's non-gender specific and can be carried by all age groups."
