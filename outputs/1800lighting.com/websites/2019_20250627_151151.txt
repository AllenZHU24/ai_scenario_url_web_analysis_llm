results.regardless of the season, a ceiling fan can save you real dollars on your utility bills. for more information, see our guide on cutting energy costs with ceiling fans.indoor and outdoor ceiling fansceiling fans are perfect for indoor and outdoor use. but before you purchase one, make sure you take measurements of your room, so you will get the right size. if your ceiling fan is too
