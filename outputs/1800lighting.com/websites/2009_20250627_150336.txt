natural stones and light colors. gothic styles are much darker and heavier using mostly iron. whimsical a whimsical fixture might not necessarily provide the ample light for a room. it is more of a statement piece – like art – that adds to the story of a room. often dainty and unassuming, a whimsical fixture can be that finishing touch to the perfect room. tiffany-stained glass stained glass design is often called tiffany design after the man that made it mainstream – louis comfort tiffany. the design was motivated from the ideals of the arts and crafts movement and can often be seen in geometric, free form, and specific designs. craftsman-mission mission and architectural styles draw their inspiration from the turn of the century. often incorporating stained glass and hand forged metals, this style harkens back to the days of gustav stickley and frank lloyd wright. clean and sleek lines – purpose built are the main characteristics of this style. asian asian style incorporates elements from china, japan, vietnam, and korea among other asian nations. natural cues from bamboo and stone accompany clean straight lines that emphasize functionality. alabaster stone-glass genuine alabaster stone is mined in quarries throughout the world. the veining is the natural evolution of the stone used to create the molded piece of rock. alabaster glass often takes natural alabaster dust and combines it with a resin mold to achieve a similar look to genuine alabaster at a more economical price. cast brass natural cast brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. instead of using thin stamped brass and then plating it, cast brass takes hot molten brass and designs a casting that is brass throughout. its weight and characteristics lend itself to being more expensive the plated brass. morrocan moroccan style is a new trend in decoration, which has been made popular by the vogue of riads renovation in marrakech. the moroccan style often defined by the colors of the desert (golds, yellows and silvers) and the sea (greens, blues and reds). tropical tropical style often includes island motifs like palm trees and exotic fruits. woods, wicker, and floral designs using island colors such as lush greens and bright pinks are staples of tropical styles. rock crystal rock crystal is a semi-precious stone that is found in nature. skilled artisans shape the crystal to adorn chandeliers and lamps. the natural veining of rock crystal shows how no two pieces are exactly alike. french country while there are many elements that contribute to the french country style of decorating, the resulting look is always rustic, old and welcoming. typical attributes usually found in french country style include distressed white finishes, looping scrolls and pastel colors. southwestern southwestern style has its roots in new mexico and arizona and steeped in native american heritage. often incorporating images of trees and other natural surrounding, southwestern items are usually finished in earth toned colors of bronze and creams. art deco art deco is characterized by use of materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, lacquer and inlaid wood. the bold use of stepped forms and sweeping curves, chevron patterns and the subburst motif are all typical of art deco style. nautical nautical design is reminiscent of the ocean and ships that sailed it as well as the ports they would frequent. hard lines and prismatic glass that remind one of the bulkheads on sailboats and large cruise vessels highlight this category. porcelain porcelain fixtures incorporate ceramic materials made by heating clay materials into specific molds. lenox branded porcelain is of the highest quality and craftsmanship. children's lighting children’s lighting often features famous childhood motifs or characters adding a delicate touch to a young one’s room. our company the capitol lighting story showroom locations & hours contact us privacy policy shop advanced search current promotions brand directory 1800lightingpro(for professionals only) need assistance? customer support return policies track your order lighting articles faq's site map © 2009 capitol lighting, all rights reserved. lighting your home for over 80 years.
