my clearance purchase arrived damaged, what do i do now? faq answers what steps should i take if my payment method is declined at checkout? if your payment is refused during the checkout process, there are several factors that the problem could be attributed to. these factors can include, but are not limited to: inaccuracies in billing address or the card number, inadequate funds, or fraud protection enacted by your card issuer. we advise that you first review your card particulars. if you have confirmed these details and continue to encounter issues, please contact our customer experience team where a representative can assist you in resolving these issues. back to top when will i be billed for my order? the full sum of your order will be authorized and collected at the time of purchase to ensure the allocation of both backordered and in-stock items. in the event that you choose to cancel all or part of your order prior to shipment, the associated funds will be returned to your original form of payment upon confirmation of your cancellation. back to top do you provide discounts for bulk orders? our trade professionals program extends special discounts to qualified trade professionals, such as designers, architects, and contractors. enrollment in our trade professionals program is straightforward and free via our website. furthermore, if you require a quotation for a substantial purchase, our sales team is available to support you. seize the advantages of our trade program by contacting our sales team today and commence savings on your upcoming project! back to top does capitol lighting charge sales tax? as mandated by law, we are obligated to collect sales tax on orders dispatched to the majority of us states. the sales tax will be automatically computed during the checkout process. if you possess a valid resale license, you may qualify for tax exemption; however, this submission must occur before completing your purchase. regrettably, we cannot refund taxes subsequent to the initial purchase, irrespective of tax status. kindly reach out to our customer experience team for guidance regarding the submission of tax exemption forms.. back to top why am i incurring shipping charges despite the statement "free shipping for orders over $49"? some items, such as oversized, fragile, or special order products, are exempt from free shipping as they are shipped via truck freight. furthermore, if your order total is below $49 before taxes, you will be subject to a shipping fee. please refer to our shipping policies for more information. back to top do you offer international shipping? currently, our shipping services are limited to the united states and canada. should an item need to be delivered to an area outside of either location, we can assist by shipping the product to a us or canadian based address. it is then the customer’s responsibility to arrange for international freight forwarding services if they are required. back to top what if i find the same item at a lower price after i've made a purchase? at capitol lighting, we offer a 110% price match guarantee. should you come across the same item advertised at a lower price within 30 days of your purchase, we will reimburse you 110% of the difference. for further information, please click here. back to top do purchased items have a warranty? at capitol lighting, we uphold the quality of the products we sell. many items have warranties from the manufacturer to offer protection against defects. however, these warranties typically exclude coverage for normal wear and tear and the longevity of finishes over time. it’s for this reason that we recommend purchasing our protection plans for added peace of mind. our protection plans extend coverage beyond a manufacturer’s warranty, safeguarding your purchase against unforeseen damages and accidents. with our protection plans, you can confidently enjoy your products knowing you’re fully covered. feel free to contact us to discuss available protection plans for your desired items, or conveniently add them to your cart at checkout! invest in a protection plan today to ensure the enduring satisfaction of your purchase. back to top can i make changes to my order after it has been confirmed? we recognize that circumstances may arise and you may need to make changes to your order. please keep in mind that once your order is placed, we immediately take steps to have your order fulfilled as quickly as possible. for this reason, any changes to the quantity ordered or the finish of your chosen item cannot be made. we can, however, assist you with either a cancellation, return request, or reselection in instances such as these. in regard to address changes, we are happy to make the request with the warehouse responsible for shipping but we cannot guarantee a successful update. please note that if your order has already been dispatched or is awaiting carrier pickup, we will be unable to make changes to your shipping address. if your order/product is shipped via a freight carrier (ltl), any address changes will incur a reconsignment fee. back to top why is my order still delayed when i chose an expedited shipping option? expedited shipping options, like two-day and overnight, pertain solely to the shipping process. this means that choosing an express shipping option does not affect order fulfillment, lead times, or backorder dates. expedited shipping will only go into effect when your item has been picked up by a carrier. you still may select an express shipping option on backordered items, but keep in mind that your express shipping will not go into effect until the item is back in stock and is in transit to you. when making a decision about shipping options, please note that they are non-refundable. once express shipping is selected, it becomes final. furthermore, expedited shipping options are only available to items that can be shipped via fedex; any items that must be shipped by a freight truck are not eligible for express delivery. if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team for further assistance or clarification. back to top how can i cancel my order? we understand that circumstances may arise where you wish to, or need to cancel your order. while we strive to accommodate cancellation requests whenever feasible, please note that not all products are eligible for cancellation. items ineligible for cancellation include made-to-order pieces, orders that are in the process of being fulfilled, and items that have already shipped. in the event we are unable to cancel your order, we can assist you with a return where applicable. please note that in these instances, our standard return fee policy will apply.. back to top i no longer need the item i ordered but it's already in transit. what happens if i just refuse the shipment? we kindly request that you do not refuse a shipment if you have decided you no longer need the item. refusing a shipment can complicate the return process by changing the return tracking and delaying the final inspection of the item, thus delaying your refund. to ensure a smooth and timely return and refund, we recommend reaching out to our dedicated customer service team to initiate a return. our team will provide you with the necessary instructions and assistance to facilitate the return. your satisfaction is important to us, and we are here to help make the return process as seamless as possible. back to top how do i return a product? to initiate a return, please have your order number ready when you make your return request. you may submit your request via any of the methods listed below: sign into your account and request your return in the order history section. live chat with an agent. call us toll-free at 800.544.4846. submit a request via this link. please refer to our return policy for more information. back to top if i place an order online, can i return it to a capitol lighting showroom? we understand that some customers prefer to return their ecommerce orders directly to one of our showrooms. we are happy to accommodate this request to make every interaction as convenient as possible. however, please note that returning an ecommerce order in the showroom does not exempt you from the applicable return fee. after inspection, ecommerce orders are shipped back to the vendor, and the standard 10% return fee will still apply. our aim is to provide a transparent and streamlined returns process. if you have any questions or need further assistance with your return, please reach out to our customer service team. back to top how is my refund calculated for a returned item? we work with our vendors to absorb return costs. however, please note that a 10% return fee will be deducted from your refund to cover shipping and handling costs. this applies to both ecommerce and showroom returns. for more details, please refer to our return policy. back to top how long does it take to receive a refund for a returned item? once a returned item reaches its destination, the product must be inspected. typically, the inspection takes up to 48 business hours from the time the item arrives at its return destination. your refund will be issued once the inspection has been completed. please allow 3-5 business days for the refund transaction to be processed by the banks and posted to your statement. if there are any issues processing the refund, our dedicated customer experience team will contact you directly to resolve the matter. we aim to provide quick and timely refunds and appreciate your patience during this process. back to top my clearance purchase arrived damaged, what do i do now? as customer satisfaction is our utmost priority, clearance products undergo a rigorous quality assurance inspection to ensure they resemble a "like new" state. if a clearance product doesn't pass this inspection, the order will be canceled and a full refund issued. clearance products are considered non-returnable, but if something was missed during the inspection, please contact our customer service to provide pictures for return approval. please note that clearance items are sold at a discounted price due to their “like new” nature, so we cannot provide parts for, or replace a clearance product. we appreciate your understanding and look forward to serving you. back to top your browser's javascript functionality is turned off. please turn it on so that you can experience the full capabilities of this site. exclusive offers thanks for subscribing! check your inbox for 15% off your first purchase! this email has already been used. sign up for notifications of special promotions and offers from capitol lighting connect with us customer service customer support shipping return policies track your order manage emails site map our company the capitol lighting story career opportunities showroom locations & hours press room contact us privacy policy terms and conditions cookie preferences become an affiliate shop blog current promotions brand directory trade professionals program commercial and hospitality projects capitol care protection plans installation services 1.800.544.4846 live chat online now contact us responses within 24 hours back to top guest id: © 2018 capitol lighting. all rights reserved.&nbsplighting your home for over 100 years. $
