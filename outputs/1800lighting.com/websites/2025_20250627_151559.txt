large & oversized items certain items ship via truck freight and will incur a $120.00 surcharge per item. these items are marked as such on the product pages. freight delivery is to curbside or driveway only, as we do not offer white glove service. the freight company executing delivery will be chosen at the discretion of 1800lighting.com, and the carrier will then arrange a delivery time window with you. it is the responsibility of the customer to provide an accurate contact phone number for the delivery address. failure to do so may result in the carrier being unable to schedule delivery, in which case the customer inherits responsibility for any storage fees or freight charges back to the shipper. at the time of delivery, please inspect the shipment and note any visible damage on the delivery receipt. noting the condition of the delivery is the responsibility of the customer - not the driver. change of address we understand that you may need to change the delivery address for your order. while we are happy to assist you with an address change, we cannot guarantee its success. there are some scenarios, such as if your order has already shipped, where we will no longer be able to successfully update your delivery address. if you are in the process of changing addresses and have concerns over the timing of delivery, please contact our customer experience team at 1.800.544.4846, where they can confirm lead times and best advise you during your checkout process. please be aware that capitol lighting will not be held liable for any lost products that were shipped to the original address provided if an address change cannot be accommodated after shipment. shipping lead times please be aware that lead times provided on product pages are estimates based on current stock availability with the manufacturer. for time-sensitive purchases, contact us at 1.800.544.4846 to confirm availability and explore expedited shipping options. please note that estimated shipping dates are subject to change. in the event there is an update to your shipping date, you will receive an order status email. as capitol lighting assumes no responsibility for costs incurred for installation and/or assembly, we strongly recommend not scheduling any professional services until your order has arrived and been inspected by the customer. additional information shipping charges are non-refundable. orders cannot be fulfilled to a po box address. in certain scenarios, capitol lighting can assist with missing shipments. however, once delivery has been confirmed, customer assumes responsibility for product. your browser's javascript functionality is turned off. please turn it on so that you can experience the full capabilities of this site. exclusive offers thanks for subscribing! check your inbox for 15% off your first purchase! this email has already been used. sign up for notifications of special promotions and offers from capitol lighting connect with us customer service customer support shipping return policies track your order manage emails site map our company the capitol lighting story career opportunities showroom locations & hours press room contact us privacy policy terms and conditions cookie preferences become an affiliate shop blog current promotions brand directory trade professionals program commercial and hospitality projects capitol care protection plans installation services 1.800.544.4846 live chat online now contact us responses within 24 hours back to top guest id: © 2018 capitol lighting. all rights reserved.&nbsplighting your home for over 100 years. $
