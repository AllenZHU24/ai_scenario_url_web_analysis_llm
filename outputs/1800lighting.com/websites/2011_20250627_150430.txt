outdoor lighting fixtures should be placed near key areas of interest: near signs, by doorways and stairs thus more evenly distributing the light. too much light can give glare and make exiting or entering a property and space difficult, as well. outdoor lights should be used somewhat sparingly, lighting a pathway, entryway and exterior walls is key to good lighting design. extra light does not always mean we can see any better. the use of outdoor wall lights can help reduce glare because the light is projected onto the exterior walls of a building. outdoor lighting fixtures strategically placed, can aid viewing a doorway entrance or exit area of a property safely. check out the full article, understanding exterior entry lighting by capitol lighting before planning and installing outdoor lights, outdoor wall lights and outdoor lighting fixtures for your home. | more tags: 1800lighting.com , outdoor lighting 0 comment tiffany–style lighting from capitol lighting!
