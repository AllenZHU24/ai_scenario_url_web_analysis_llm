from disappointed course did not run on safari as a user of mac computers, ipad and iphone, i was disappointed that the course lessons did not run on safari. the course material was good though some of the photography did not give a clear vision of the material. date published: 2017-08-03 rated 4 out of 5 by jk22340 from learning a lot i'm a complete novice so i've learned many new things. the instructor goes a little fast sometimes and have to rewind to catch it all but that's the bonus of a video date published: 2017-05-15 rated 5 out of 5 by debra j from i bought a number of titles i love the great courses! i feel like a kid in a candy store each time i see what's available (which is everything). from gardening to shakespeare to writng, the education, professionalism and quality of each course surpasses other courses i have ordered. i want to learn a veriety of things and these short courses allow me to do so. i have told many friends about the great courses and they too are thrilled with what they have ordered. date published: 2017-04-17 rated 3 out of 5 by meo72 from general remarks i can not write about "how to grow..." at the moment, since i did not have time to look at it closely. i need more time for a review of its content and its applictions.. i can tell you about other lectures i bought, though. your approaches and presentations are sometimes very good (tyson's lectures, lectures on big history, and dr flippenko's astronomy lectures), but sometimes not so good and even difficult to concentrate (your one lecture set i have about about entry level medicine -i can not recall its name, you can get it from my list of courses i ordered-). in general, my overall grade is positive (7 to 8 out of 10). i found the lectures mostly, well prepared and carefully designed. date published: 2017-04-09 rated 5 out of 5 by cynr from lots of tips and tricks! i finished watching this course over a 5-day week and enjoyed each of the lectures. something to be learned in each of them. i particularly appreciated some of the great tips for soils, potting edibles, and arranging vegetables and flowers together. edible landscaping! the production was great and the background was interesting and colorful! although i am a long-time gardener and am familiar with much of what melinda myers discussed, i still learned a few more details and insights from each of the lectures. date published: 2017-03-07 rated 5 out of 5 by jonie from i really enjoyed this course. i am an experienced garden and this course covers the topic well. i learned new and helpful gardening tips. i liked the instructors approach and was definitely inspired. date published: 2017-02-21 rated 5 out of 5 by mouse from the book with all her recommendations. i have 2 pages of notes from the first dvd. i've ordered many things that i've seen her use. also sent my soil for testing. date published: 2017-02-05 rated 4 out of 5 by jackiconn86 from title is a bit too generalized i loved the ease of understanding this class. i am beginning gardener and it didn't feel over my head. there is so much about soil and prep work that influences the outcome. date published: 2017-02-04
