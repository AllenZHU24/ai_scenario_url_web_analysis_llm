what has changed—and what has remained constant? book of genesis professor gary a. rendsburg the book of genesis is familiar, clear, powerful, elegantly written. it is the book with which both jews and christians alike begin their bible. but is it possible that our understanding of the book of genesis we've all grown up with isn't as complete as we'd like to believe? its deceptively simple message hides an intricate structure and treasures of detail behind sophisticated literary devices. professor gary a. rendsburg shows you how to fully appreciate what he calls "one of the most remarkable literary compositions from the ancient world." save up to $205 between cross and crescent: jewish civilization from mohammed to spinoza professor david b. ruderman this course presents an overview of jewish culture and society, from its rabbinic foundations in late antiquity up to the dawn of modernity in the 17th century. introduction to judaism professor shai cherry judaism is far from simple, and as a religion, culture, and civilization, it has evolved in surprising ways. professor shai cherry shows how, for all it has changed, judaism has maintained unbroken ties to a foundation text, an ethnicity, a set of rituals and holidays, and a land. join him for this enlightening 24-lecture course and discover judaism’s remarkable history. great world religions: judaism professor isaiah m. gafni what is the essence of judaism? is it the ten commandments? the teachings of the hebrew bible? or something else entirely? professor isaiah m. gafni of the hebrew university of jerusalem addresses these and other fundamental issues as he explores the ever-changing, 4,000-year saga of judaism, one of the world's most ancient and influential religions. throughout great world religions: judaism, you study this faith as it was understood by its adherents in the past and by those who practice or identify with judaism today. old testament holy land revealed why evil exists beginnings of judaism book of genesis between cross and crescent: jewish civilization from mohammed to spinoza introduction to judaism great world religions: judaism back 1 next 1-8 of 8 15 per page 25 per page 50 per page view all contact us| privacy policy| site map| gift certificates| affiliate program| careers © this site and content copyright 2011. the teaching company, llc. site contents are also protected by other copyrights and trademarks. all rights reserved. ssl
