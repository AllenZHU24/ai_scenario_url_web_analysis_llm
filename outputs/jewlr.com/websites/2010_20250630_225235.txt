a promise ring is offered as a prelude to marriage. when you look into the eyes of another person and you know that you want to spend the rest of your life with them, you offer a promise ring. we carry beautiful promise rings which make the perfect romantic gesture used to prove your commitment of lifelong love and devotion to that special somebody. there is no better way to make this promise, than with an unending circle, a visible symbol of faith. history of the promise ring? many people believe that promise rings are a relatively new tradition, but this is definitely not the case. promise rings have been around for much longer than you and i. promise rings date as far back as the early 16th century. during this time the cost of a wedding prevented many people from expressing their love through a marriage, so many people who could not afford to get married began offering promise rings to their partners, as a placeholder until they could afford to get married and to signify their commitment to one another. you will find that many promise rings were engraved, they read "vous et nul autre" which if translated from old french means "you and no other." tradition generally holds that these promise rings were given by younger couples. this was usually the case because it was normal for the young couple not to have a wealth position that would allow for marriage and children. nowadays anyone can give a promise ring, regardless of wealth or social status. what finger do you wear a promise ring on? promise rings can be worn on any finger, but are usually worn on the third finger of either hand. there are two schools of thought regarding the origin of the 3rd finger being designated the "ring finger." for those logical souls, this finger is the most practical one for wearing a ring. protected by fingers on either side, and not as active as the first two fingers and thumb, it is a safe haven for jewelry. a more romantic notion is the ancient belief in a "vena amori," or vein of love, which runs from the 3rd left finger to the heart. traditionally, such a ring would be worn on the left hand. however, some wearers feel that there is less likelihood of confusing the ring with an engagement ring if it is worn on the right hand and therefore, right-hand wearing is gaining acceptance. how to choose a promise ring? nearly any ring can be purchased as a promise ring. many designs contain the heart symbol and it is symbolic in that the lover dedicates their heart to being with each other. sterling silver promise rings are just as popular as white gold promise rings. other designs don't necessarily contain hearts. they are usually simplistic in design and may have diamonds. many diamond promise rings use 3 stones (usually smaller in stone size than the engagement three stone) or another classic design. there are many different promise ring styles: *engraved promise rings we have some special engraved promise rings that will make the perfect promise ring gift for your girlfriend. choose the ring, enter your engraving and you can see what your engraved promise ring will look like. create your own engraved promise ring today. *personalized promise ringscreate your own personalized promise ring and truly make it yours. personalize a promise ring with your choice of gemstones, birthstones and engravings. she will love your uniquely created personalized promise ring. *diamond promise rings go with the classical touch and get a diamond promise ring to show your love. *yellow gold promise rings another classic, the yellow gold promise ring will have a very classy effect. *white gold promise rings a very popular style of promise rings are white gold promise rings *sterling silver promise rings another option if you dont want a gold promise ring is a sterling silver promise ring *birthstone promise ringscreate a unique promise ring for the one you love and by selecting a birthstone promise ring including their birthstones in the ring *heart promise ringsanother very popular promise ring selection is a heart promise ring which is beautifully designed in the shape of a heart *couples promise rings you can both show your love for each other by wearing beautiful couples promise rings. *promise ring for girlfriend to choose a promise ring for your girlfriend, take a look at all of our unique designs. we guarantee that she will be happy with and fall in love with the ring. *mens promise rings check out our great selection of mens promise rings. we have some very unique designs and it can be personalized in any way you like. *affordable promise rings make sure to browse our great value collection of affordable promise rings. we have many designs and that are both affordable and beautiful. the perfect combination! they are also many that can be personalized in any way you like. take a look at our other great rings collections: mothers rings , personalized rings, kids rings and birthstone rings. faq lowest price guarantee customer service shipping information return policy affiliate program privacy policy about us buyitforfree™ popular collections birthstone jewelry name jewelry personalized jewelry gift ideas for her for him for mom for kids birthstones by month shop by price less than $100 less than $200 less than $500 less than $1000 rings promise rings birthstone rings mothers rings personalized rings couples rings necklaces name necklaces birthstone necklaces name jewelry name necklaces name rings name earrings name jewelry follow jewlr on twitter become a facebook fan of jewlr subscribe to our newsletter: copyright © 2011 jewlr.com. all rights reserved. feedback
