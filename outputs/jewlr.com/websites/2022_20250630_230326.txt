help@jewlr.comdiamonds & the 4csthe forever stonehypnotic brilliance. unmatchable strength. timeless beauty. the diamond is more than just a gemstone. it is an ancient symbol of resilience and endurance. it is a promise of unending devotion and everlasting love. it is a timeless emblem of elegance, grace and refinement. it is the forever stone for your forever love.our mission here at jewlr is to make sure that your diamond is perfect for you in every way. as part of the decision-making process, we want you to know as much as possible about the diamond you purchase and feel confident in the quality of your jewlr piece. there are four factors to consider when determining the quality of a diamond, known in the industry as the 4cs: cut,colour, clarity, and carat weight. let the 4cs be your guide as you create your luxury bridal collection diamond engagement ring.jump tojump tocut/carat weight/color/clarityideal cuta well-cut diamond takes light in through each pavilion facet at an angle, which allows most of the light to reflect back through the crown (top). the light refracts upon exit, passing through the crown facets at a low angle.cutthe cut is the most important of the 4cs as it determines the brilliance of a diamond. expertly cut diamonds sparkle the brightest because of the precise position, angle and shape of the facets, which allow light to reflect from the table (the top of the diamond).too shallowshallow-cut diamonds can look larger in appearance, and are also known as "spread diamonds." if a diamond is cut too shallow, the majority of light that enters is refracted from the bottom, resulting in a dull appearance.too deepdiamonds that are cut too deep will refract more light than shallow-cut diamonds, but will still have less brilliance and sparkle than an excellent cut. also, deep-cut diamonds tend to look smaller when put in a setting.ideal cuta well-cut diamond takes light in through each pavilion facet at an angle, which allows most of the light

appearance in three ways: fire (the rainbow-colored sparkle seen when a stone is exposed to light), brilliance (the colorless light that shines from the diamond), and scintillation (flashes or sparkle seen when a diamond is in motion). at jewlr, we offer only diamonds ranked as good,very good, or excellent cut to ensure the very best in quality and value.good cuta good cut reflects most of the light that enters through the table, but less than that of a very good cut. good cuts represent about the top 25% of diamond cut quality.very good cutthe very good cut represents the top 15% of diamond cut quality. it reflects near the same amount of light as an ideal cut diamond, but at a lower price point.excellent cutexcellent cut diamonds are quite rare and reflect the most light entering the stone. representing the top 3% of diamond cut quality, excellent cut may also be referred to as ideal cut.cut:stone shapethe classic round brilliant cut remains the most popular, but diamonds are available in a variety of shapes. with luxury bridal collection signature setting, jewlr is proud to offer a selection of styles that are timeless classics: round brilliant, oval, and princess. look for more styles available soon.roundthe quintessential engagement ring shape with a perfectly circular top, a round brilliant diamond is the symbol of a love that never ends.shop roundovaloval diamonds are a nod to tradition with a splash of individuality. an oval diamond can be cut to the same brilliance as a round stone, making it just as elegant and unique as its wearer. shop ovalprincesswith its unmistakable sparkle, a princess cut diamond demands attention. prepare to catch eyes, turn heads, and feel like royalty.shop princesscarat weightcarat is the measurement of a diamond by weight. the standard is 1.00 carat = .20 grams. certain factors can make a stone look larger than its carat weight such as the size of the crown and the shape. round, oval and marquise cut diamonds will appear larger to the eye, while princess cuts may look smaller. keep in mind, carat alone does not determine the value of a diamond.0.50 ct0.70 ct1.00 ctdzcolord-f (colorless)- color
