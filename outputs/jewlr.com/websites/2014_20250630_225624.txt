engagement rings first started as a reminder of the commitment of wedlock: to bless and keep each other in sickness and in health, always and forever. today, an engagement ring symbolizes the promise of marriage, which is to be united together before friends and family forever more. traditionally, the woman's ring is offered as a gift to her when the man proposes marriage.engagement rings come in all shapes and sizes. white gold and platinum engagement rings are somewhat popular, but the most traditional versions are simple gold bands with set gemstones. emeralds, rubies, and colored diamonds have all been used, but a white or clear diamond is the most common. the diamond symbolizes eternity or longevity because a diamond is the hardest known substance; it lasts forever and nothing can break it. diamonds are formed over millions of years, galvanized under intense heat and pressure in the earth's crust until something beautiful is created. the diamond symbolizes the intent of marriage, which is to form a bond so tough and lasting that it can never be broken.the engagement ring is an important cultural symbol, playing a prominent part in the biggest promise you'll ever make. rings have been used to symbolize marriage and commitment since archduke maximilian of austria gifted a golden ring with diamonds set to form a letter "m" to his bride-to-be, mary of burgundy, in 1477. the original engagement ring inspired other upper class figures to betroth diamonds to their loved ones as gifts, a tradition that has lasted for centuries. over 80% of engagement rings purchased today contain one or more diamonds.by the 1940s, engagement rings had become the best selling line of jewelry in every jewelry store, and more than a third of people buying engagement rings spend two months' salary or more on what will be the most special gift they ever buy. following significant media coverage and discussion of blood diamonds coming from africa, the kimberley protocol was created and implemented in the year 2002 to ensure that only responsibly mined diamonds ever arrive at market. featured engagement ring milana engagement ringandlove all around shadow band an impressive 1ct stone in a micro-pave setting with six shoulder stones to complete this special piece. stunning when paired with the 'love all around' band. sign-up for our newsletter! receive 10% off your first order and other great offers! subscribe customer care call us between 9am to 5:30pm eastern time. 1-866-610-8482 or email us @ customerservice@jewlr.com personalized jewelry every item at jewlr can be personalized. create your own one of a kind piece by selecting the metal, stones and engravings - and receive it in just a few days! we're taking giant leaps in revolutionizing the jewelry industry by using custom design preview technology, 3d printers, laser engravings, mixed with traditional hand-made manufacturing. change country: usd cad company about us why choose jewlr privacy policy press buy it for free program testimonials terms and conditions contact us learn faq swarovski gems™ charm info packaging my story jewlr gift cards risk-free ring sizing 99 day return policy one year warranty free shipping free gift jewelry certificate international orders shipping information why choose jewlr about us faq shipping information 99 day returns one year warranty copyright © 2015 jewlr. all rights reserved. × top valentine's day sale valentine's day gift guide rings rings all rings infinity promise men's promise mother's engagement wedding couples men's celtic and claddagh family stackable coolr karma birthstone birthstone rings all birthstone garnet (january) amethyst (february) aquamarine (march) diamond (april) white topaz (april) emerald (may) smokey quartz (june) alexandrite (june) ruby (july) peridot (august) blue sapphire (september) pink tourmaline (october) citrine (november) blue topaz (december) stone count stone count no stone rings solitaire two stone rings three stone rings four stone rings five stone rings six stone rings 7-13 stone rings stone shape stone shape round marquise heart pear baguette princess pendants pendants all pendants heart promise infinity name necklaces monogram necklaces birthstone mother's family tree cross shaped layered charms bracelets earrings collections collections new items best sellers trending styles infinity jewelry swarvoski statement swarvoski zirconia celtic & claddagh jewelry heart jewelry judaica collection symbols jewelry infinite expressions yoga collection graduation collection quick ship collection gifts gifts for mom for girlfriend for daughter for him for bridesmaids jewlr gift cards wedding wedding wedding bands bridal sets bridesmaid gifts bands for him my account free shipping return policy
