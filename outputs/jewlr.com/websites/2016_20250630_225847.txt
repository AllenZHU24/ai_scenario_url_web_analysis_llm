99-day returns one year warranty made in usa & canada engraved charms engraved charms are an enduring and classical tradition that many people have taken advantage of for years to add meaning, substance, and originality to their pieces of jewelry. you can have your charm engraved in the metal of your choice and customize it to say what is most important to you. by choosing the metal, the stones, and the engraved message, you can create a unique charm for yourself or a loved one. while buying a charm is certainly a wonderful and thoughtful act, engraving that charm is a wonderful way to make it even more special. engraved charms are a wonderful way to express love, gratitude, or commemorate a special occasion. traditionally, it is common for charms to be inscribed with the initials or name of a special person. nowadays, people still inscribe these basic details, but also enjoy inscribing important dates, or even locations, on their charms. did you have a memorable trip with a loved one? the date and place of this trip can be inscribed on a charm for a constant reminder and a physical token of something beautiful shared together. other great dates that are commonly inscribed could be graduation dates, an anniversary, a birthday or any other meaningful and private date. whatever is inscribed, the simple but classy act of engraving a charm really puts a nice final touch on the whole piece. going that extra mile to have some form of customization added to the jewelry makes the charm that much more meaningful. an engraved charm is successful in saying what it is sometimes difficult to say in a card or in person with words. it conveys meaning on a whole different level and marks the charm as special, something to be cherished, and unique. if you have a special memory that you hold dear, a special figure in your life that you want to remember, or a special someone that you want to shower with love, consider customizing a charm by having it engraved. this step is one of those actions that really goes above and beyond just the regular piece of jewelry and stirs up emotion. featured charm take a look at this featured teddy bear charm. my teddy bear charm there was a time when a teddy bear was one of your best friends and it made you feel safe whenever you held it close to you. this teddy bear charm will be just as special, holding a birthstone on one side and having a name or a love message engraved on his big heart, on the other side. perfect for kids, new mothers, the teenagers you will always see as beautiful babies!
