a: to avoid delivery day disappointments, measure the area you plan to place your new furniture in, as well as the furniture you have selected to purchase, before placing your order. also measure any doorways (height and width) through which the furniture must pass to get to its final position in your home. identify any delivery obstacles - is there enough ceiling clearance? will the furniture clear the stairway or elevator? can the piece be maneuvered around any right angles? because of our commitment to providing you with outstanding customer service, as safely and efficiently as possible, delivery personnel are unable to hoist furniture or carry furniture up more than 3 flights of stairs. an elevator must be available for deliveries to the 4th floor and above. q: how should i prepare for delivery day?
