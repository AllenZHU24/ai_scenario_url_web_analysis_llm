top transit times we are located in gig harbor, washington (usa), which means that some orders mailed to the east coast, or outside of this country, may not arrive as quickly as orders mailed to destinations that are closer to us. please note that occasionally, orders may take longer to process than stated due to large order volumes associated with holidays, special promotions, or delays associated with the carrier. international orders pass through customs, which may add additional delays. for more information on possible service interruptions with shipments sent via usps please

pickup: orders placed any time up to 11am pt on saturday will ship saturday unless the saturday falls on a holiday. changes to delivery addresses: if we are asked to make a change to a delivery address once a shipment left our facility, we will contact the courier to try and have them reroute the shipment. this may result in additional fees that you will be responsible for. note that changes to delivery addresses are not possible for shipments sent via usps. refusal of package: if you refuse or do not claim a package shipped via fedex you will be responsible for the original delivery charges and be charged the fee to ship the package back to us as well as any duties charged to us. deliveries to hotels when requesting delivering to a hotel, if the front desk refuses the package for any reason you will be responsible for the original delivery charges as well as any charges required to reship the package. economy mail: artbeads reserves the right to ship either directly with usps

not be reimbursed. apo/fpo addresses: note that only our usa economy shipping and usa priority mail methods are available for apo/fpo shipments. neither usa express mail or federal express are currently available. customs charges/import duties: for international orders, any duties, taxes or other import fees assessed by customs will be the responsibility of the recipient. signature waivers: customers choosing to waive required signatures for federal express and express deliveries assume all responsibility for their orders once they leave our facilities. special instruction: please do not ask us to have the usps leave packages "on the back porch," etc., as the usps does not accept special requests. fedex tracking: if you have elected to ship via fedex and would like to track your order, please go to the fedex website and enter your tracking number to check the shipping status. lost packages: on rare occasions, due to no fault on our part, a package sent via the usps may not arrive at its destination. in such an instance, we will reship your order after a reasonable time has elapsed, but will require that you sign and return a letter confirming that your package indeed was never received. this is required so that we can be reimbursed by our insurance company. if we do not receive this signed form back from you, we reserve the right to charge you for the replacement shipment. note: fraudulently reporting that an order was lost or any other scheme intended to obtain money or property under fraudulent pretenses is a federal crime that will be reported to the united
