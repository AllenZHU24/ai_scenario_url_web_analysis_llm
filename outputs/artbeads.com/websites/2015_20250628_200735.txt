as orders mailed to destinations that are closer to us. please note that occasionally, orders may take longer to process than stated due to large order volumes associated with holidays, special promotions, or delays associated with the carrier. international orders pass through customs, which may add additional delays. for more information on possible service interruptions with shipments sent via usps please click here. for shipments sent via fedex please visit: http://www.fedex.com/us/servicealerts/. additional information important: fedex will not deliver to a p.o. box. fedex saturday pickup: orders placed any time up to 11am pt on saturday will ship saturday unless the saturday falls on a holiday. changes to delivery addresses: if we are asked to make a change to a delivery address once a shipment left our facility, we will contact the courier to try and have them reroute the shipment. this may result in additional fees that you will be responsible for. note that changes to delivery addresses are not possible for shipments sent via usps. refusal of package: if you refuse or do not claim a package shipped via fedex you will be responsible for the original delivery charges and be charged the fee to ship the package back to us as well as any duties charged to us. deliveries to hotels when requesting delivering to a hotel, if the front desk refuses the

sent via the us postal service or other carrier never arrive at their destination. in such an instance, we will reship your order after a reasonable time has elapsed. we would, however, require that you sign and return an affidavit confirming that your package was never received. this affidavit will be due back to us before we can reship your replacement order and is a necessary document that enables us to be reimbursed by our insurance company and file a claim with the united states postal service. if we do not receive this signed form back from you within 30 days from receipt, we will assume that your order has been received and this issue has been resolved. if your order was not received because shipping information provided during check-out was incorrect, this policy will not apply. please contact one of our skilled customer service representatives to discuss your various options. note: fraudulently reporting that an order was lost or any other scheme intended to obtain
