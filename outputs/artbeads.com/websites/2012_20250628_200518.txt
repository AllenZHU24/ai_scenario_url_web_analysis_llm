these holidays: martin luther king jr.'s birthday presidents' day labor day columbus day veteran's day while we will be open on these holidays and processing orders, unfortunately, due to all carriers (u.s. mail, fedex, etc.) being closed on these days, we will not be able to ship out any orders. back to top transit times we are located in gig harbor, washington (usa), which means that some orders mailed to the east coast, or outside of this country, may not arrive as quickly as orders mailed to destinations that are closer to us. please note that occasionally, orders may take longer to process than stated due to large order volumes associated with holidays, special promotions, or delays associated with the carrier. international orders pass through customs, which may add additional delays. back to top additional information important: fedex will not deliver to a p.o. box. no fedex pickup on saturday: orders placed after 11am pt on friday, or any time during the weekend, will ship on monday or the following business day if the monday falls on a holiday. changes to delivery addresses: if we are asked to make a change to a delivery address once a shipment left our facility, we will contact the courier to try and have them reroute the shipment. this may result in additional fees that you will be responsible for. note that changes to delivery addresses are not possible for shipments sent via usps. refusal of package: if you refuse or do not claim a package shipped via fedex you will be responsible for the original delivery charges and be charged the fee to ship the package back to us as well as any duties charged to us. deliveries to hotels when requesting delivering to a hotel, if the front desk refuses the package for any reason you will be responsible for the original delivery charges as well as any charges required to reship the package. delays beyond our control: delays in delivery due to "acts of nature" or mechanical issues will not be reimbursed. apo/fpo addresses: note that only our usa economy shipping and usa priority mail methods are available for apo/fpo shipments. neither usa express mail or federal express are currently available.

to waive required signatures for federal express and express deliveries assume all responsibility for their orders once they leave our facilities. special instruction: please do not ask us to have the usps leave packages "on the back porch," etc., as the usps does not accept special requests. fedex tracking: if you have elected to ship via fedex and would like to track your order, please go to the fedex website and enter your tracking number to check the shipping status. lost packages: on rare occasions, due to no fault on our part, a package sent via the usps may not arrive at its destination.

required so that we can be reimbursed by our insurance company. if we do not receive this signed form back from you, we reserve the right to charge you for the replacement shipment. note: fraudulently
