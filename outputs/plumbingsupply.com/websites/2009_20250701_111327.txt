(outside diameter) of the pipe. 1/2" nominal fittings use 5/8" od pipe; 3/4" fittings uses 7/8" pipe and so on. "i have 'refrigeration grade' copper tubing. how do i determine which size copper sweat fittings to use?" refrigeration grade copper tubing is sized according to the outside diameter of the copper pipe. the plumbing industry uses the inside diameter (nominal) size of the pipe for their measurement of sweat fittings. to figure what size sweat fittings to use on refrigeration grade tubing you must subtract 1/8" from the outside diameter of the pipe measurements. if you have 1/4" outside diameter refrigeration grade tubing then you will need to order 1/8" (nominal) sweat fittings. click here, to see our conversion table. we hope that we have helped you on this page with copper fittings, and thank you for helping make plumbingsupply.com the most famous internet plumbing supplier. click here to go to our favorite "quotable quotes" page: "don't gamble. take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up then sell it. if it don't go up, don't buy it." - will rogers is there something else that you are looking for? enter what you're looking for here: or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z homepage | about us | contact us | how to order | view shopping cart | testimonials | q and a | return policy copyright© 1995-2009 all rights reserved. plumbingsupply.com
