"what does 'ada compliant' mean?" a. complies with the americans with disabilities act (ada) of 1990. the americans with disabilities act of 1990 is a comprehensive civil rights act for people with disabilities. on july 26, 1990, the president signed the ada into law as wide-ranging legislation intended to make american society more accessible to people with disabilities and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. the ada was built primarily due to the desire of individuals with disabilities to work toward their goal of full participation in american society, and effects the ada may have on businesses include restructuring or altering the layout of a building, modifying equipment, and removing barriers. q. "i'm not disabled, simply getting older. do i need ada compliant items? " a. not specifically, but the qualities of an ada compliant item are beneficial to everyone. ada compliant products ensure that the item, if installed per manufacturer specifications, will hold a certain amount of weight, be within a certain dimensions, and perform in a certain manner to allow universal accessibility. looking for stylish ways to make aging in place easier? click here. return to top ↑ we hope that we have helped you on this page with products for those physically challenged, and thank you for helping to make plumbingsupply.com® the most famous internet plumbing supplier. fun, inspirational quote of the day: "nature hates calculators." - ralph waldo emerson is there something else that you are looking for? enter search terms: or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home | about us | contact us | how to order | view cart | shipping info | q and a | feedback/suggestions | disclaimer | return policy copyright© 1995-2015 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
