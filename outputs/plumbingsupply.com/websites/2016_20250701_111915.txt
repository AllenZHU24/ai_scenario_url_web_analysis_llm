"will ips-sized fittings work with npt pipe thread?" a. yes. many companies and individuals use the abbreviation ips which normally refers to iron pipe size. when we use the term 'ips-sized', or either mips (male) or fips (female), we are referring to pipes with npt threads. npt is the abbreviation for national pipe thread tapered which is the thread standard used in the united states for galvanized, black, brass, stainless steel, pvc, abs or other materials to connect pipes and fittings in plumbing. we offer more detailed information about npt pipe threads here. q. "how do i know these ips threads will work with my pipe since you don't show threads per inch (tpi) for each of the npt thread sizes?" a. we show threads per inch for all pipe sizes between 1/16" and 12" and much more information on our pipe thread sizing page. q. "i tightened my threaded nipple into my female threaded fitting, but it won't thread all the way in. some of the threads are still showing. shouldn't it thread all the way in?" a. no, tapered threads should not thread all the way in. tapered pipe threaded nipples are not designed to thread all the way into the female thread fittings. tapered pipe threads are designed to get tighter as they are joined, until they are forced to stop because of the taper, or pressing the threads together to form the seal. pipe threading compounds and ptfe tape are used to lubricate and fill in any imperfections in the threads to help prevent leaks. once tightened by hand and then with a wrench there should usually still be 2-3 threads showing. if you try to force the threads beyond the normal tightening proceedure, then you could possibly split the female fitting. generally and ideally speaking, you should be able to hand tighten tapered pipe threads 3 turns and then tighten them with a wrench 3 turns and then there should be 3 threads showing. q. "how does lead get into drinking water right now?" a. primarily, trace amounts of lead get into drinking water due to aging infrastructures, such as old pipes and plumbing systems parts. the plumbing manufacturer's institute (pmi) states that over the past decade, lead levels in plumbing fixture fittings have been reduced to insignificant levels due to improvements in modern manufacturing processes. q. "how does lead content in brass faucets affect me?" a. water is a solvent, probably the best known solvent on earth. as such, water will absorb metals, minerals, and chemicals that it comes in contact with over a period of time. a faucet that has brass waterways can be susceptible to this process. water sitting in your faucet can leach the lead out of the brass and enter your water system. q. "i'm hearing a lot about lead-free these days. what does that have to do with plumbing products and how does the new lead-free legislation affect me?" a. basically, the laws implemented jan. 1st, 2014 require plumbing products that come in contact with drinking water to be "essentially lead free" (less than 0.25% weighted average). for further information about how the law determines what is "lead free", rules regarding which plumbing products must be "lead free", and who these laws will affect, please click here. a quick note about copper and lead... if your home has copper water piping and those pipes were installed before 1986, your copper pipe/fittings were generally joined or soldered together with "50/50" solder. 50/50 solder was comprised of 50% lead and 50% tin and had been used by the majority of plumbers to join copper pipe and fittings for many decades. for homes that have 50/50 solder in their water piping we recommend that you install and use a lead removal filter for your drinking water. lead has been determined to have significant negative impacts on health, especially for children, and there is no safe level determined for human consumption. for more information about what lead free laws mean for you and frequently asked questions about lead in plumbing, click here. return to top ↑ quote of the day to have no heroes is to have no aspiration, to live on the momentum of the past, to be thrown back upon routine, sensuality, and the narrow self. - charles horton cooley is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2016 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2016 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
