"what are the measurements of the #500-tl-abs trip-lever drain assembly itself?" a. the distance between the center of the horizontal drain line and the screws on the overflow plate cannot exceed 14-1/2" or be less than 9". the distance between the center of the vertical tubular vent line and the center of the tub drain itself cannot exceed 7-1/2" or be less than 6-3/4". q. "what is tpi?" a. tpi stands for "threads per inch." you need to match the threads per inch of the strainer body with the drain shoe (the bit the strainer body screws into that connects to the waste piping). q. "i purchased a stainless steel strainer that has an oil rubbed bronze finish. i have had it for less than a year and it appears to be rusting. i thought stainless steel would not rust?" a. stainless steel does not rust, stain or corrode when used in most residential water conditions. however, some cleaning products can cause it to corrode. avoid cleaners containing chlorides, like bleach for example. chlorides can be very detrimental to stainless steel depending on the level of concentration and the type of stainless steel. we suggest a mild cleanser be used and then rinsed thoroughly. return to top ↑ quote of the day a rudderless ship and a purposeless person are eventually stranded on desert sand. - unknown is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2019 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2019 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
