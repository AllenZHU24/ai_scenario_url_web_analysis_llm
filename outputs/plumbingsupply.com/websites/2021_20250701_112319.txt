"why do some faucets cost so much more than others?" a. some faucets are simply made better than others with higher quality material such as solid brass, which generally provides a superior look, performance, and durability. while you may pay more for a quality faucet, you're likely to receive more value for your money as a result of longer, more reliable, trouble-free service. paying more doesn't always mean you'll get a better value, but generally, a more expensive faucet (just like a more expensive appliance, automobile, etc.) does give better and longer service. we recommend that you do shop around once you know the exact brand and model that you want, to avoid paying extra for the exact same faucet or avoid the hassle of dealing with a disreputable retailer. q. "seems like a faucet is a faucet... aren't most faucets about equal.. shouldn't i just buy the lowest priced ones?" a. it is true that you don't always get your money's worth by paying more. on the other hand, just like cars, there are "cheap" cars and quality cars. we like to recommend that you buy quality faucets from a reputable dealer and that you shop (compare) prices on the same brand models. q. "i have a hole in my kitchen sink for an air gap. i'd like to use it for a faucet. can i just by pass that air gap?" a. you could but we absolutely do not recommend that. air gaps have an important (health safety) function and should be kept on the deck of the sink or kitchen counter. q. "can i replace a two handled kitchen faucet with a single handled model?" a. absolutely. standard-size openings and faucet dimensions are used throughout the u.s. plumbing industry. q. "i really like the new "designer" finishes, but i'm wondering if they are as durable as chrome. what do you recommend?" a. in our opinion, nothing beats triple plated chrome for a lifetime of durability. that being said, however, many manufacturers have worked hard to make their other finishes more durable and long-lasting, so it really is a matter of personal preference and use. additionally, many manufacturers now offer special care/cleaning guides with their products to help you maintain the new designer finishes as long as possible. q. "can a hose spray model be installed in a 3-hole kitchen sink?" a. sure, many faucet manufacturers offer faucets designed for one or two holes. most common sink configurations have either 3, 4 or 5 mounting holes on the sink top. look under the sink to determine the number of holes in your sink because the holes may be covered by an existing faucet. also, note that once you have purchased a faucet without a sprayer that you generally can't just add a sprayer. you need to decide before you purchase a kitchen faucet whether you want a sprayer or not. q. "any helpful hints?" a. all faucets will leak and need servicing eventually. a good idea is to once or twice yearly, open and close all shut off valves under all faucets (if any). this will help keep them free of sediment and will allow them to be closed when needed. q. "why should i choose a water efficient faucet?" a. well, the numbers can speak for themselves: it is estimated that by installing water efficient faucets and accessories, the average household can save more than 500 gallons per year. most of us know that we can conserve water by turning off the tap when not in use, but many may not know you can save water while using it with the right water saving faucet. while manufacturers vary in their definition of "water efficient", the faucets labeled here as water efficient have a 2.0gpm or less water flow, with many featuring a 1.5gpm or less flow. q. "what are the new california energy commission water efficiency standards and how does this affect me?" a. effective january 1, 2016, certain plumbing fixtures will be required to comply with new california energy commission requirements for flow rate and water efficiency. since the program began in 1976, it has continually worked to develop standards for energy- and water-using appliances and fixtures that will help californians to conserve energy and water. to help the state deal with current and future drought conditions, only water-saving plumbing fixtures will be legally available for sale in california. products like faucets, toilets, urinals, and shower heads are all affected by the new regulations. sold after january 1, 2016: public lavatory faucets & aerators must have a maximum flow rate of 0.5 gallons per minute or less (at 60psi) kitchen faucets & aerators must have a maximum flow rate of 1.8 gallons per minute or less (at 60psi) - dual function faucets may have an optional temporary flow of 2.2 gallons per minute toilets must use a maximum 1.28 gallons per flush or less - or a dual-flush effective flush volume of 1.28 gallons per flush or less wall mounted urinals must use a maximum 0.125 gallons per flush or less other urinals must use a maximum 0.5 gallons per flush or less sold after july 1, 2016: lavatory faucets & aerators must have a maximum flow rate of 1.2 gallons per minute or less (at 60psi) shower heads must have a maximum flow rate of 2.0 gallons per minute or less (at 80psi) sold after july 1, 2018: shower heads must have a maximum flow rate of 1.8 gallons per minute or less (at 80psi) what this means for the average consumer is that you can rest easy knowing that the product you're getting is compliant with the law - and will help you do your part to save water, our most precious natural resource. additionally, it is important to note that current epa watersense program requirements are not as stringent as the california energy commission requirements. thus, not all watersense products may be compliant with the new laws in california. please be sure to review the specifications of the product you're purchasing prior to placing your order as we cannot ship non-compliant products to our customers in california. q. "why don't you offer any watersense certified kitchen faucets?" a. currently, the watersense program doesn't offer certification for kitchen faucets. however, many companies (including popular symmons, delta, and american standard) who manufacture watersense certified lavatory faucets have also found ways to make their kitchen faucets more water efficient as well. return to top ↑ quote of the day old age, believe me, is a good and pleasant thing. it is true you are gently shouldered off the stage, but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator. - confucius is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2021 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2021 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
