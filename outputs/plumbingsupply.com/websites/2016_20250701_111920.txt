$499.99 2 weeks $500 - $2,499.99 3 weeks $2,500 - $9,999.99 4 weeks $10,000 - $19,999.99 5 weeks $20,000 - $39,999.99 6 weeks $40,000 and over 8 weeks the main reason that we have this crazy long check holding/waiting period is to protect ourselves. some scam/fraud artists send checks that appear to be legitimate and ultimately end up being worthless. we have read of a number of cases where many weeks have passed before the recipient (too late) found out that the check was worthless. so, should you pay us by check, and we cash/deposit that check, and should you then wish to cancel the order before we have shipped that order, we will not mail a refund back to you until the above mentioned times have passed. (please be aware, too, that we also charge a "bounced check" fee for all checks returned to us due to insufficient funds.) yes, it's a sad state of affairs that these days we all can't trust each other totally. sad to say but sending phony checks is a very common occurrence by some thieves. therefore, we are very diligent in attempting to protect ourselves from check fraud, which ultimately means lower prices for all of our customers. we do accept regular mailed checks as a courtesy to our customers, but please note that if you would like for us to ship your product quickly, then please pay us with a credit card (because both you and we are better protected when you use a credit card). even netflix doesn't accept "pay by check" as a payment method and that is mainly because of the hackers that have ripped them off with checks. here is what netflix says on their website about checks: "payment methods like traditional check-in-the-mail payments, money orders or purchase orders take longer to process, so we are unable to accept them at this time." - as of november 2010 fact: in 2007 the u.s. postal inspection service started an international crackdown on fake checks. more than 540,000 fake checks with a face value of $2.1 billion have been seized as of dec 2007. to keep our prices lowest we do not accept cod orders, purchase orders, foreign checks/money orders, or wire transfers. note: when using a credit card you are totally protected! sales tax?: orders shipping to california are subject to a 7.50% sales tax. resale certificate?: if you're a reseller, you'll need to print and fax us this form. standard shipping | 2nd day shipping | us mail shipping orders are normally shipped via standard ups ground, fedex, or us mail (tubs and very heavy items will ship by other means). when you select "standard shipping" - which is based off of the subtotal of the order, and is the default shipping method - it will be shipped by one of the methods available to us (us mail, or ups, or fedex) and out of those we will select the method that is most appropriate for what was ordered. if you do not receive shipments from any one of these methods (maybe us mail doesn't deliver to your address), please make sure we are aware of this by putting a note in the customer comments section located on the "final review" page of our shopping cart. we only ship to u.s. destinations, us territories and military apo's. it generally takes up to 7 business days by standard carrier (fedex or ups) for normal shipping. note: please allow extra shipping time during the holiday season. we normally ship within 24 hours (mon-fri) unless noted otherwise. security risk ordering on-line from us? we take security very seriously. plumbingsupply.com® complies with the strongest identity authentication standard available today by utilizing an extended validation ssl certificate. a unique and highly visible green address bar will display in the latest high-security browsers in the secure portion of our shopping cart (where you input your personal information). this bar immediately helps assure you that plumbingsupply.com® is an authenticated web site. additionally, a green security bar highlights our name and also includes a notation next to the address bar that our organization is certified by comodo. the green address bar and security bar helps you know that plumbingsupply.com® is a legitimate web site and that your transaction will be secure. to show our faith, we guarantee it -- there is no risk to you, period! if anything happens, we'll make sure that you owe nothing for internet credit card fraud due to ordering on-line from us. you can order with confidence from us, as we have been doing so with no loss to any of our customers since 1995. return to top ↑ quote of the day love is, above all, the gift of oneself. - jean anouilh is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2016 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2016 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
