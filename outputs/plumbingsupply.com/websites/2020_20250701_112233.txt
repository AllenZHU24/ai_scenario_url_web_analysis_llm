toilet ceramic water closets - history book creators of the first toilets frequently asked questions q. "how can i find the parts i need for my particular toilet?" a. the best place to start is your toilet tank - to determine what your toilet model number and brand are. some toilets might even have a list of replacement parts on the underside of the tank lid. check out our video below to learn more about how your toilet works and how you can find the right replacement parts for your toilet - or read our guide to finding "will fit" toilet parts for more assistance. q. "wow! it looks like you offer a huge selection of toilet repair parts. do you sell toilets as well?" a. yes we do. we offer residential toilets such as: barclay and macerating toilets. we also offer a few commercial toilets and urinals. q. "do you offer pressure-assist toilets, or repair parts for them?" a. due to safety concerns with pressure assist toilets, we choose not to offer this type of toilet nor do we offer parts for these models. there are many toilet models that were offered as both "pressure assist" and "non-pressure assist" and we offer parts for the "non-pressure assist" models. q. "i didn't see any water saving eco-friendly toilet tank parts on your site and was wondering if you might add them in the future?" a. there are many so called eco-friendly products on the market. however, eco-friendly does not necessarily mean user friendly. in our opinion, we have not found one that is user friendly. toilets are designed to flush with a set water usage and that is why the federal government passed a law in the 1990's that all new toilets made must flush using 1.6 gallons of water or less. once the waste is flushed from the toilet, a certain amount of water is still needed to push the waste down the drain line to the sewer or septic tank. most "eco-friendly" conversion devices we have seen allow the user to flush a toilet at two levels. some are called 'dual flush'. one level is set higher to allow a lesser amount of water to be flushed into the bowl, and the other lower level to allow a full flush when needed. the one set higher will not necessarily flush the water in the bowl, but can dilute it. not eco-friendly in our minds if it is not sanitary. if you have to flush a toilet twice to get the water in the toilet to flush completely out, then it is not "eco-friendly", and possibly should be replaced with a toilet that is designed to use less water and still flush properly. possibly in the future, if someone designs a tank coversion product that is both eco-friendly and sanitary, then we would certainly consider offering that product. please note: we do offer parts for caroma dual flush toilets and commercial dual flush flushometers. return to top ↑ quote of the day it takes 200,000 frowns to make a permanent wrinkle. - facts is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2020 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2020 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
