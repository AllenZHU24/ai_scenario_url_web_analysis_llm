(california law requires this warning to be given to customers in the state of california.) items with lead are not for use in potable water systems and are only for industrial non-drinking water applications ×close ca prop 65 information warning! some products may contain detectable amounts of lead, a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. the state of california requires clear and reasonable warnings on products containing chemicals that may lead to cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. even if these products contain only trace levels of harmful chemicals, a warning is required by the state of california. items with lead are not for use in potable water systems and are only for industrial non-drinking water applications why is lead in drinking water a bad thing? for centuries, people have known that lead is bad for you, and that lead poisoning can be fatal. however, it hasn't been until the advent of recent technologies that we've understood exactly how and why lead is bad for the human body. due to its corrosion-resistance and ease of working with it, lead was used in ancient times for water pipes, cooking pots, eating dishes and utensils, and more. even with the transition from lead pipes to those made of cast iron, copper, and galvanized steel, many times the brass fittings or solder used to join pipes contained significant amounts of lead. if you've ever taken a chemisty class, you're probably familiar with the concept that water is a solvent. this means that it will absorb things like minerals, metals, and chemicals that it comes into contact with over a period of time. water sitting in your pipes will gradually leach lead from the joints or fittings. in addition, as the plumbing system in a building ages, the pipes, fittings, and joints will corrode - again leaching lead into the water supply. when you drink that water, you're ingesting lead. the human body is amazing at destroying or getting rid of many harmful substances, from certain minerals and indigestable fibers to bacteria and viruses. however, these biological mechanisms only work if the body recognizes the invader. guess what lead is really good at? mimicking helpful substances that your body needs, like calcium, zinc, and iron. thus, lead poisoning isn't so much a case of having too much lead, but of having that lead bind to and interact with the enzymes your body utilizes for proper functioning - blocking those good minerals and metals from attaching to the enzyme and doing what they're supposed to to keep your body healthy. thus, no safe level of lead in the body has been identified. even small amounts of lead can disrupt your immune system, interfere with metabolism and vitamin/mineral absorption, inhibit neurological function, and even damage your dna. babies and children are the most at risk for lead poisoning primarily because their growing bodies are so much faster at absorbing and processing any lead they are exposed to. when the lead takes the place of the good nutrients a child's body needs to continue growing, bad things happen. even low levels of lead in the blood of children can result in behavior and learning problems, abdominal pain and vomiting, slowed growth and brain development, nervous system damage, hearing problems, anemia, and in rare cases can cause seizures, coma, and even death. brain/nerve damage or delayed development in children related to lead poisoning is irreversible. what is the safe drinking water act? as of august 6, 1998, the federal safe drinking water act (the act) prohibits any person from introducing into commerce, products that are not "lead free" as defined by the act. the u.s. environmental protection agency has determined that for a product to be considered "lead free" under the act, it must satisfy the performance standard for lead leaching under nsf standard 61, section 9 (nsf 61/9). items covered by nsf 61/9 include lavatory faucets, (excluding metering, self-closing, and electronic faucets), bar and kitchen faucets, valves, supply lines, fittings, and many other products that come into contact with drinking water supplies. the act applies to residential, commercial and institutional installations, as well as new and retrofit applications. california proposition 65, "the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986" is the most stringent law (that we know of) of its kind at either the state or federal level. the federal standard for lead in drinking water is 11 ppb (parts per billion) while prop 65 (calif) mandates a level of .05ppb. the center for environmental health recommends that consumers run water for 10 seconds before filling a glass to remove water with the highest lead levels (from pre "act" faucets). additionally, with the passage of california assembly bill 1953, maryland house bill 372, and vermont assembly bill vt s.152, "lead free" is defined as to mean not more than a weighted average of 0.25% lead content in pipe and fittings. what this means for you is the lead content in faucet spouts and fittings will not be legally allowed to have more than one-fourth of one percent of lead, so water traveling through compliant faucets will be essentially "lead free". ca ab 1953 defines lead as less than 0.25%. this bill changes the meaning of term "lead	free" in the health and safety code from eight percent lead for pipes or pipe fittings, and four percent lead for plumbing fittings and fixtures to a weighted average of not more than 0.25 percent lead content within each component that comes	into contact with the wetted surfaces of pipes and pipe fittings, plumbing fittings and fixtures effective july 1, 2010. however, it is important to note that while products meeting the requirements of the law are defined as being "lead free", they may still contain trace amounts of lead. the new lead free act went into effect nationally in 2014. couplers / couplings couplings with stop -

"i have 1/2" copper fittings, can i use 1/2" o.d. copper tubing with those fittings?" a. probably not. in the plumbing trade when we say 1/2" fittings we mean fittings that use 1/2" nominal pipe. to figure what size pipe to use with standard plumbing fittings, you must add 1/8" to your measurements to know the o.d. (outside diameter) of the pipe. 1/2" nominal fittings use 5/8" od pipe; 3/4" fittings uses 7/8" pipe and so on. q. "i have 'refrigeration grade' copper tubing. how do i determine which size copper sweat fittings to use?" a. refrigeration grade copper tubing is sized according to the outside diameter of the copper pipe. the plumbing industry uses the inside diameter (nominal) size of the pipe for their measurement of sweat fittings. to figure what size sweat fittings to use on refrigeration grade tubing you must subtract 1/8" from the outside diameter of the pipe measurements. if you have 1/4" outside diameter refrigeration grade tubing then you will need to order 1/8" (nominal) sweat fittings. view our conversion table. q. "what does nominal mean?" a. manufacturers of copper pipe and sweat fittings use the inside diameter (nominal) size of the pipes for their definition of their pipe and fitting measurements. some companies use the abbreviation cts for copper tube size to refer to the copper nominal size. the term nominal is used because the inside diameter is not a precise measurement due to the different pipe thickness used for copper pipe. the outside diameter stays constant so the inside diameter will vary slightly. since the outside diameter stays constant you can measure the outside diameter of a copper pipe and then you will be able to convert that measurement to the nominal pipe size. this will help you to determine the correct size of sweat fittings you will need. you can do this by taking the outside diameter measurement of the copper pipe and subtract 1/8" from that measurement which will give you the nominal inside diameter. view our conversion table. q. "is there lead in copper?" a. copper is 100% copper and does not contain lead. some fittings composed of brass can contain a small percentage of lead because of the process in how they are made. brass fittings that are compliant with the 2014 federal safe drinking water act contain no more than 0.25% lead (weighted average). q. "why are some of these fittings, valves, and nipples not for potable water?" a. starting january 1st of 2010, california and vermont enacted new low lead laws. effective january 2014, our u.s. congress also passed the reduction of lead in drinking water act (public law p.l. 111-380) which revised the safe drinking water act definition of "lead free" to mean 0.25% or less (weighted average) in pipes and fixture fittings used for potable water. before then these top quality brass products were legal for potable water and used throughout the world and actually contain much less lead than products manufactured before the 1980's. q. "i'm hearing a lot about lead-free these days. what does that have to do with plumbing products and how does the new lead-free legislation affect me?" a. basically, the laws implemented jan. 1st, 2014 require plumbing products that come in contact with drinking water to be "essentially lead free" (less than 0.25% weighted average). for further information about how the law determines what is "lead free", rules regarding which plumbing products must be "lead free", and who these laws will affect, please view our page. a quick note about copper and lead... if your home has copper water piping and those pipes were installed before 1986, your copper pipe/fittings were generally joined or soldered together with "50/50" solder. 50/50 solder was comprised of 50% lead and 50% tin and had been used by the majority of plumbers to join copper pipe and fittings for many decades. for homes that have 50/50 solder in their water piping we recommend that you install and use a lead removal filter for your drinking water. lead has been determined to have significant negative impacts on health, especially for children, and there is no safe level determined for human consumption. for more information about what lead free laws mean for you and frequently asked questions about lead in plumbing, view our page. customer testimonials "thank you for your great customer service and follow up with this order.....being in the service industry myself (realtor and previously in the restaurant business) i understand the importance of great customer service and letting others know - feel free to quote me and use my name, town and state. keep up the good work." - kathy sollien, realtor, bennington, vermont 05201-1724 "pleasure doing business with your site! i will be back!!!" - steve combs, scottsdale, arizona 85251-6425 "i found the hard to find items i needed." - michael rohwedder, schererville, indiana 46375-2763 please note that every customer testimonial shown on our pages has given us written permission to quote them. our customer's privacy is very important to us, and we will never give, share or sell contact information or e-mail addresses to anyone! return to top ↑ ×close not for potable/drinking water items with lead are not for use in potable water systems and are only for industrial non-drinking water applications although these products were used for many years before safe drinking water laws became stronger, they are no longer acceptable for use in potable water systems due to the lead content. the u.s. environmental protection agency has determined that for a product to be considered "lead free" under the 2014 federal safe drinking water act, it must satisfy the performance standard for lead leaching under nsf standard 61, section 9 (nsf 61/9). "lead free" is defined as to mean not more than a weighted average of 0.25% lead content in pipe and fittings. what this means for you is the lead content in faucet spouts and fittings is not legally allowed to have more than one-fourth of one percent of lead, so water traveling through compliant faucets will be essentially "lead free", but please be aware that due to the definition of "lead free" as containing not more than 0.25%, there may still be trace amounts of lead in products that are defined by law as being "lead free" and for potable/drinking water. california proposition 65, "the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986" is the most stringent law (that we know of) of its kind at either the state or federal level. the federal standard for lead in drinking water is 11 ppb (parts per billion) while prop 65 (calif) mandates a level of .05ppb. the center for environmental health recommends that consumers run water for 10 seconds before filling a glass to remove water with the highest lead levels (from pre "act" faucets). the 2014 law changed the meaning of the term "lead free" in the health and safety code from eight percent lead for pipes or pipe fittings, and four percent lead for plumbing fittings and fixtures to a weighted average of not more than 0.25 percent lead content within each component. the items noted as being not for use with potable water systems may have been previously allowed for use in potable water systems, but do not meet the newer standards laid forth in the 2014 federal safe drinking water act, and therefore cannot be safely used for potable/drinking water applications. ×close what does nominal mean? manufacturers of copper pipe and sweat fittings use the inside diameter (nominal) size of the pipes for their definition of their pipe and fitting measurements. some companies use the abbreviation cts for copper tube size to refer to the copper nominal size. the term nominal is used because the inside diameter is not a precise measurement due to the different pipe thickness used for copper pipe. the outside diameter stays constant so the inside diameter will vary slightly. since the outside diameter stays constant you can measure the outside diameter of a copper pipe and then you will be able to convert that measurement to the nominal pipe size. this will help you to determine the correct size of sweat fittings you will need. you can do this by taking the outside diameter measurement of the copper pipe and subtract 1/8" from that measurement which will give you the nominal inside diameter. nominal size to od size conversion table o.d. of pipe 1/4" 3/8" 1/2" 5/8" 7/8" 1-1/8" 1-3/8" 1-5/8" 2-1/8" nominal pipe size 1/8" 1/4" 3/8" 1/2" 3/4" 1" 1-1/4" 1-1/2" 2" nominal wall thickness for copper pipe (in inches) nominal tubing sizein inches type l type m 1/4 .030 - 3/8 .035 .025 1/2 .040 .028 3/4 .045 .032 1 .050 .035 1-1/4 .055 .042 1-1/2 .060 .049 2 .070 .058 2-1/2 .080 .065 3 .090 .072 quote of the day the will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence. - confucius is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products search find plumbing products starting with a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z we accept most credit cards and paypal our shopping cart is secure, so you can shop with confidence! we accept most credit cards and paypal our shopping cart is secure, so you can shop with confidence! home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2025 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2025 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
