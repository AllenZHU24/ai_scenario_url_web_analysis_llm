"why do i only have two days to notify you of any problems with my order?" a. this is necessary in order to determine the next course of action in regards to how the damaged/defective/incorrect item(s) will be taken care of. in many cases, time is of the essence, and the quicker we are aware of the issue, the better the results. in order to serve you better, we request that you inspect all of your products for obvious defects/blemishes within 2 days of receiving them. q. "what is an rga, and why do i need one?" a. when it is necessary to return a product, an rga is necessary as it is our way of keeping track of returned items so they can be processed properly. if you want to return products to us, please use our online rga request form prior to doing so. all returns, regardless of how they were shipped or where they were shipped from, must be referenced by an rga number (returned goods authorization number). do not refuse your shipment, as you will be responsible for any additional shipping charges incurred for the refusal (as well as a higher restocking fee). items returned without an rga number may be set aside until we hear from the customer or even refused delivery entirely. we process thousands of orders weekly, and subsequently receive a sizable number of returns. if not referenced by an rga number, a returned package will need to be researched so that the customer can be contacted regarding the return. this results in higher overhead, higher prices, and often delays the processing of credit. this system is necessary to ensure that you receive proper credit in a timely fashion. when you contact us via our online return request form requesting an rga to return a product, we will either issue the rga at that time, or contact the warehouse that it shipped from and request that one be issued. if we need to receive the rga from another warehouse, we will let you know by forwarding the information to you along with shipping instructions as soon as we receive it from them. the instructions for return must be followed carefully, as some items may need to be shipped to separate warehouses. once the product has been received at our warehouse, it will be inspected and you will be credited for the returned product less the applicable restocking fee and original shipping charges. also, on incorrectly ordered items, the customer is responsible for return shipping costs to the warehouse(s) of origin. if the product is returning to another warehouse, they will contact us once they have received the product, inspected it, and we have been issued credit. once we have been credited for the return, your credit will be issued less the restocking fee and original shipping charges. q. "what is a restock fee?" a. all returns are subject to a restocking fee. we have a standard restocking fee of 15% on returns within 30 days. if you wish to return a product but do not place a reorder, the normal restocking fee will be 15% (for items returned within 30 days) but can change if any of the following information applies. if a reorder is placed for a similar product (costing nearly the same amount), the restocking fee can be lowered from 15% to 10%. our standard restocking fee on orders received over 30 days can be as low as 25%; however, it may be higher if an extensive amount of time has passed since delivery or if our return instructions have not been adequately followed. for a product to be considered a "reorder", it must be for a product that directly replaces the item that's being returned, in both price and type. for example: if a $200.00 sink is returned, the reorder must be for a sink of comparable value. please note that if for some reason the reorder must be returned, the restocking fee for the return of the reorder will be at least 25%. also, items returned after 30 days are subject to a higher restocking fee or may not be returnable at all. we will let you know our decision when we respond to your request. your reorder must be placed prior to your credit being processed. if you wish to reorder right away, reference will be made to your return on your reorder to ensure that you receive the lower restocking fee. if you need to apply your credit to your reorder, you can do so, but we will need to receive the product and/or credit for the product before doing so. q. "if i ordered wrong, do you pick up the incorrect product(s) if i reorder?" a. unfortunately, no. if we shipped an incorrect item, or the item is defective, then we do take care of the shipping both ways (see our faq on incorrect/defective items); however, as we cannot be held responsible for shipping the correct item that happens to have been incorrectly ordered, you will be responsible for return shipping to the warehouse(s) of origin (if from more than one warehouse, there may be multiple return locations and you are responsible for the return shipping to those warehouses). if you refuse a shipment, the cost of the shipping back to us will also be deducted from any applicable credit. q. "why can't i just ship the product back to you if i have received the wrong/incorrectly ordered item?" a. please do not return any product that you have ordered without prior contact and acknowledgment. many products ship direct from the manufacturer or one of their access warehouses and often need to be returned to the same warehouse. these warehouses will refuse deliveries that are not properly marked and documented with issued rga numbers. this will make processing your credit very difficult and may delay your credit. q. "what happens to my package if i accidentally provided the wrong address for shipping?" a. once an order has been shipped, it will be delivered to the address provided by the customer. should that address be incorrect or incomplete, the shipping carriers charge a fee for an address change request, or to return it to our warehouse (or to the warehouse it shipped from if direct from the manufacturer). unfortunately, as this is a cost they will not waive, we must ask our customer to accept responsibility for providing the incorrect or incomplete address, and will ask for payment of the additional charge to redirect or re-ship the order. typically, the two options are to either: 1) pay for the posted shipping cost for the reshipment; or, 2) credit (less the restocking fee and shipping) will be issued. should you need the order re-shipped, any charges incurred from the shipper in returning it to us (or the manufacturers warehouse) will also be charged. q. "what happens if i accept a damaged shipment? will you take care of it?" a. if you do accept a damaged shipment, please inform us and the carrier (ups, fedex, etc.,) immediately within those 2 days. depending on the product and where/how it was shipped, it may be necessary for you to deal with the carrier. most trucking companies will only deal with the receiver in cases of damaged goods. also, if there was any internal (non-visible) damage, this will need to be reported to us and the carrier within two days of receiving the product. once you have informed us (and the carrier) with this information we will send you complete instructions on how we will be taking care of the damaged goods. we wish to take care of you and get your damaged product replaced as soon as possible. please do let us know if you have not received the instructions within 1-2 business days. please do not ship the product back to us without contacting us first and receiving an rga number and all the important instructions. q. "how do you take care of defective items?" a. should we determine that the product is in fact defective (and was returned in accordance to our return instructions and policy), we will not only pay the cost of shipping the new non-defective product to you, but we will also reimburse you for standard delivery rates (not 2nd day shipping) that they charge for shipping the defective product back to us. this does not include any 3rd party processing fees imposed by some shipping companies. this offer is only good in the continental u.s. if you ship the product back to us from outside of the lower 48 states, you will need to pay for the cost of sending the product to us. if the product is defective, you will receive a replacement. if you choose to return the defective item, rather than replace it, we will charge a restocking fee and your original shipping fee will not be refunded. also, items returned after 30 days are subject to a higher restocking fee or may not be returnable at all (we will let you know if this applies to your return). the return of the product is at your expense. we believe that this is a fair policy because lower overhead results in lower prices for all of our customers. if after 30 days of receiving your product, it proves to be defective, we would like for you to deal with the manufacturer. whatever policy the manufacturer has will determine how you will proceed, and may include shipping costs. we will not pay shipping costs on items that are being handled directly by the manufacturer. we supply products; we do not warranty products and after thirty days we leave it up to the manufacturers. there may be instances when the manufacturer, once they have been contacted, will ask that we help in the replacement process. if this is the case, we will assist you and the manufacturer with the return process. however, 30 days after receiving your product, it will be necessary for you to contact the manufacturer first. q. "how do i return items i don't want or need?" a. listed products (items that have listed prices on our web pages) may be returned within 30 days of receiving them; the products must be brand new (never used) and in perfect condition with all manufacturers' packaging. in order to keep our prices at their lowest, we charge a standard restocking fee (which can be lowered with a comparable reorder) and your original shipping charge will not be refunded. items returned after 30 days or without an rga #, should it be decided that they will be accepted, are subject to a higher restocking fee. returns without an rga can also possibly delay processing of your credit. we do not accept returns for used or assembled products. we do not sell used products (except for toilet tank lids) and you will not receive any used or refurbished merchandise from us.please contact us if you wish to return any products. items must be brand new (never used), in perfect condition, with all manufacturers' packaging. we will issue you an rga number and return instructions on how and where to ship the products. please keep in mind, items returned after 30 days are subject to a higher restocking fee or may not be returnable at all. return to top ↑ we hope that this page has helped you to understand our return policy, and thank you for helping to make plumbingsupply.com® the most famous internet plumbing supplier. fun, inspirational quote of the day: "conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct." - thomas carlyle is there something else that you are looking for? enter search terms: or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home | about us | contact us | how to order | view cart | shipping info | q and a | feedback/suggestions | disclaimer | return policy copyright© 1995-2014 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
