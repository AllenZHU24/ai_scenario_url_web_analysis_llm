parts toilet bowl bolt caps how to measure fora new toilet seat frequently asked questions q. "one of the colors that i see above looks exactly like my old colored toilet seat. if i order that colored toilet seat will the color be an exact match and like the color that i see on-line on this page?" a. unfortunately, every computer monitor and browser will show slightly different colors so we cannot guarantee that the colored toilet seat you see on your monitor will be the same color we see. so again, the toilet seat we ship you may not be an exact match. to make sure that your toilet seat is an exact match, we recommend that you order our "match your color" toilet seat kit instead. q. "which material do you feel makes a better seat, plastic or wood?" a. the (pressed) wood seats that are manufactured are generally well made. wood seats don't tend to "wiggle" much and should last 5 - 20 years (depends on usage and cleaning methods). if you drop the seat's lid (cover) a lot, the paint will wear off. plastic seats come in many grades and thicknesses. the lower priced ones tend to "wiggle" and move around while you are sitting on them. we suggest that "if" you are going to buy a plastic seat, you pay extra and a top quality slow closing seat with sta-tight hinges. the paint won't wear off and a good quality, slow closing plastic toilet seat with sta-tight hinges can't be beat. they are more expensive but well worth the price. q. "there seems to be a seam or a line in the plastic toilet seat i received. is this a crack or a weak spot?" a. per the manufacturer, there is a line that is sometimes visible at the front of the seat, usually just to the left or right of center. this is known as the "mold line" or "seam line", where the liquid plastic molds (or "knits") together during the manufacturing process. the line is usually more noticeable in darker seats, and runs the length of the seating rim in that spot on the seat. its important to note that it is not a weak point in the seat and will be smooth to the touch. q. "why are there so many white colored toilet seats? what is the difference between white, cotton white, crane white, etc.?" a. just like when you paint your house or purchase clothing, there are varying shades of "white" for toilet seats too. we strive to offer our customers the most comprehensive selection of colors so you can match your toilet almost as exactly as possible. with some whites, it can be difficult to tell any different, but with others the difference is obvious. for example, cotton white is a toto color often described as glaringly "white" white. it's very close to kohler, briggs, mansfield, and gerber versions of white. most people feel it doesn't match american standard's white as well as they would like. the "white" seats on this page coordinate well with american standard porcelain fixtures. naturally, all of this will depend highly on the lighting in the room and personal preference, just like any other color choice. click for larger view return to top ↑ quote of the day pull the string, and it will follow wherever you wish. push it, and it will go nowhere at all. - dwight d. eisenhower is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2019 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2019 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
