(however, as many construction sites close down across our nation, construction workers and unions have gifted their ppe to hospital workers and medical staff.) as factories shut down to prevent the spread of coronavirus, delays in materials and shipping of equipment are to be expected. at the end of march 2020, the u.s. department of homeland security, cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (cisa) updated their “essential critical infrastructure workforce” list to include not just tradespeople but also their suppliers. support supply chains providing for tradespeople have been included, and therefore protected, with this latest revision from cisa. never has such a need for skilled trade workers been felt so deeply. with the classification of “essential” and “non-essential business,” it should be apparent that skilled trades work is crucial to the vitality, infrastructure and continuity of our nation. millennials and generation z should find themselves considering these essential skilled trades jobs with a more stable job outlook. very few positives can be gleaned from this worldwide pandemic, but it has shown a light on the opportunities and stability of skilled trades work. as americans step up across the nation to support fellow americans, skilled trades workers join medical workers on the front lines by providing necessary infrastructure for the nation while risking their own health. fortunately, unions across the nation are working to ensure union workers are safe and well provided for in these unpredictable times. however, much of the nation is not unionized and will need to do their own research on available opportunities and options during the pandemic. whatever your skilled trade, take care and stay safe. for information from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) on how to protect against the virus and what to do once infected, visit their coronavirus information page related items & information plumbing & your health bidet buying guide how to avoid diy plumbing mistakes diy plumbing safety tips return to top ↑ quote of the day everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else. - will rogers is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products search find plumbing products starting with a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a+ rating we accept most credit cards and paypal our shopping cart is secure, so you can shop with confidence! we accept most credit cards and paypal our shopping cart is secure, so you can shop with confidence! a+ rating home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2022 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2022 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
