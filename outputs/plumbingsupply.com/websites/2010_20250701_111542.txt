"do you sell any showerheads that completely shut off water flow?" no, and we are not aware of any showerheads that have the ability to completely stop water flow. with your shower valve still open and the showerhead completely closed, it is possible for hot water to force itself into the cold water line. once the showerhead is opened again, only hot water flows for a moment, creating a risk of scalding. showerheads are normally manufactured to dribble a small amount and prevent this from occurring. "will an instantaneous water heater save me money on my utility bills?" in many applications you can see a savings. there are some variables that could reduce the amount you save. one example is you will not run out of hot water, so longer showers could cut into your savings. also, the cost of electricity, propane and natural gas in your area will affect the amount of money saved. the higher the cost for the energy type used to heat your water, the quicker you can recover the higher initial cost of installing a tankless versus tank style water heater. return to top ↑ we hope that we have helped you on this page with conservation plumbing products, and thank you for helping to make plumbingsupply.com the most famous internet plumbing supplier. read some more great quotes such as: when you buy, use your eyes and your mind, not your ears. - czech proverb is there something else that you are looking for? enter search terms: or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z homepage | about us | contact us | how to order | view shopping cart | testimonials | q and a | disclaimer | return policy copyright© 1995-2011 all rights reserved. plumbingsupply.com
