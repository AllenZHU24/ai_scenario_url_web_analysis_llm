"why are toilet seats non-returnable?" a. it is very important for us to be able to promise a brand-new, unused seat to each customer, and if we were to allow returns of toilet seats we simply would not be able to make that promise to every customer. that being said, we strongly recommend checking the color and size of the seat received before removing from the bag to make sure your seat is correct, as for hygiene reasons we cannot allow the return of toilet seats. q. "when i received my toilet seat, the manufacturer's box was not sealed and had already been opened. did you send me a seat that was returned to you by a previous customer?" a. the seat you received was brand new and unused by anyone before you. when we receive a shipment of seats from our supplier into our warehouse, their boxes are often opened for inspection to make sure the seats are not damaged; we also inspect the seats before we ship them to you, to make sure they're correct and in good condition. return to top ↑ we hope that we have helped you on this page with toilet seats, and thank you for helping to make plumbingsupply.com® the most famous internet plumbing supplier. fun, inspirational quote of the day: better to be silent, and be thought a fool, than to open ones mouth, and remove all doubt. - abraham lincoln is there something else that you are looking for? enter search terms: or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home | about us | contact us | how to order | view cart | shipping info | q and a | feedback/suggestions | disclaimer | return policy copyright© 1995-2013 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
