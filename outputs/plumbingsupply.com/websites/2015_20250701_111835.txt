"after i gave you my credit card number you then asked me for my 'security confirmation numbers (verification code).' i've never heard of this and no one has ever asked me before? why do you ask for this as it seems like a waste of my time?" a. to protect you (and ourselves) from credit card fraud we use the latest in fraud protection methods. that includes asking for the code that is shown on your credit card. many merchants do not use this system yet but they all will eventually. we use it to prevent fraud which keeps our prices lowest. q. "why do you charge my credit card even if it takes a week to ship?" a. we do hold your funds on special orders and back orders as a deposit on the goods until the product ships. if some situation comes up that results in us not being able to proceed with your order we will issue the proper credit back to you using the same method that you originally paid us with. q. "do you accept credit cards that are issued outside of the united states?" a. the issuing companies of non-us issued credit cards do not support our credit card verification system and we are unable to process funds at all. your credit card issuer may pre-authorize the funds (these will post back to your account shortly, or you can request that the credit card company do so immediately), but our system does not allow us access to them. even when the card has been used elsewhere in the u.s., our verification system is unable to proceed due to our higher level of fraud protection - for our customers and us. all methods of payment we accept must be drawn on a u.s. bank. let us repeat: we guarantee your credit card transaction on our site. period! we will pay for any loss that you would have using your credit card at plumbingsupply.com® due to fraud. period! return to top ↑ quote of the day good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. - wise sayings is there something else you are looking for? search plumbing products: search or - find plumbing supplies starting with: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z home about us contact us how to order shipping feedback disclaimer privacy policy return policy copyright© 1995-2017 plumbingsupply.com.all rights reserved. copyright© 1995-2017 plumbingsupply.com. all rights reserved.
