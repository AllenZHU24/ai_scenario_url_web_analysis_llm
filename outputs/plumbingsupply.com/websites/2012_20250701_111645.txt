"what does 'ada compliant' mean?" a. complies with the americans with disabilities act (ada) of 1990. the americans with disabilities act of 1990 is a comprehensive civil rights act for people with disabilities. on july 26, 1990, the president signed the ada into law as wide-ranging legislation intended to make american society more accessible to people with disabilities and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. the ada was built primarily due to the desire of individuals with disabilities to work toward their goal of full participation in american society, and effects the ada may have on businesses include restructuring or altering the layout of a building, modifying equipment, and removing barriers. q. "i'm not disabled, simply getting older. do i need ada compliant items?
