"mr. g.", as everyone knew him, was born in 1914 in a small farming community in southern indiana. at age 3, he lost his leg to infection. after crutching to school and around the farm for 10 years, he received his first prosthetic leg. it was at that point in time he decided to dedicate his life to prosthetic manufacturing and to assisting those with medical needs. in the late 1930s, he moved to michigan and continued working in the medical field. in 1957, he opened his first store in pontiac, michigan. over 50 years later, we are proud to carry on his tradition of assisting those needing healthcare products. through the power of the internet, we have been able to not only carry on his legacy, but to expand it with the creation of aleva stores. we now serve over 1,000 customers daily and are quickly becoming one of the most respected healthcare product retailers in the industry.
