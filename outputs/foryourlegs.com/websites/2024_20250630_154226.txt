"mr. g.", as everyone knew him, was born in 1914 in a small farming community in southern indiana. at age 3, he lost his leg to infection. after crutching to school and around the farm for 10 years, he received his first prosthetic leg. it was at that point in time he decided to dedicate his life to prosthetic manufacturing and to assisting those with medical needs. in the late 1930s, he moved to michigan and continued working in the medical field. in 1957, he opened his first store in pontiac, michigan. over 50 years later, we are proud to carry on his tradition of assisting those needing healthcare products. through the power of the internet, we have been able to not only carry on his legacy, but to expand it with the creation of aleva stores. we now serve over 1,000 customers daily and are quickly becoming one of the most respected healthcare product retailers in the industry. "mr. g." passed away at the age of 94. he is greatly missed by us all, but we know he is looking down and smiling upon all he's created. today, his legacy is carried on by his son, larry gaskins, and his grandson, derek gaskins. larry, derek and the rest of the foryourlegs.com team want to thank you for visiting our site and for choosing us for your compression therapy needs. who we are for your legs is the largest online compression therapy retailer who specializes in medical compression and hosiery for all of your leg and foot care needs. shop top-brands at everyday low prices from mediven, sigvaris, jobst, therafirm, juzo, rejuva, venactive and more. with a catalog of over 25,000 products, there is sure to be something to meet your needs! quality & service as our business has evolved, so has our commitment to quality products. with the launch of our new website, we are bringing you an enhanced shopping experience along with our top-quality brand choices. we have been proudly serving over 1,500 customers a day with a wide range of leg health needs for over 50 years. why trust us we believe it’s more important to make sure your garments provide the best possible results and value for the money you spend. that’s why our certified fitters have a combined over 50 years of experience assisting and providing the best possible solutions for the leg health issues our customers have experienced. ongoing training and new education programs keep each of us at the top of our ability to deliver the best solutions to our customers. what sets us apart low price guarantee. we’ll beat any advertised price by 10%...just contact our customer service team at 855-363-4980. free shipping. on orders over $100. 90-day return policy. contact customer service today. subscribe to our newsletter stay up to date on the latest news, promotions, and product releases. enter your email subscribe subscribe icon-right-arrow customer service contact usabout usshipping policyreturn policyjoin our rewards programbuy now pay latergift cards resources accountterms of serviceprivacy noticeada statementdo not sell noticereviews get in touch 855-363-4980 email us live chat follow us facebook we accept amazon american express apple pay diners club discover meta pay google pay mastercard paypal shop pay visa © 2024 for your legs a division of aleva stores. powered by shopify "close (esc)" icon-chevron about foryourlegs.com
