medi for men - these socks come in a ribbed pattern or the modern honeycomb texture. you can find reviews from happy female customers on these, like from marion: "works better for me since i have long feet." actifi cotton comfort socks - these cotton blend socks have a long foot and a wide toe box to give your feet and toes freedom! plus, the cotton blend will keep you cool and make sensitive skin happy. available in 15-20 and 20-30 mmhg best compression socks for men with wide feet if you have a wide foot, but not a long one, finding a well-fitted sock can also be a struggle. here are a few of our favorite for customers with widths of 2e, 4e or 6e: jobst formen casual - fan favorite for wide feet! these wide socks have a business sock look, but would be perfect for every day. the expansive foot portion is great for wide, but not necessarily long feet. sigvaris cushioned cotton - one of our faithful customers with eee width feet tried and tested three different brands and decided these were his favorites for comfort and fit! a classic ribbed sock, the foot of this sock provides extra cushion making it great for long walks or exercise. jobst sensifoot - if you're after a light compression sock - these are a great option. in 8-15 mmhg, we have customers who love the generously wide foot, seamless toe and super soft construction. what have you tried and loved? tell us in the comments!
