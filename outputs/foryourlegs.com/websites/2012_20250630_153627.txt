named to internet retailer’s second 500 list. internet retailer is a monthly national business magazine that is at the core of the leading retail information web site, an e-commerce conference and five directories that serve the retailing community. internet retailer's definitive ranking and analysis of america's 500 up-and-coming e-retailers is based on annual 2010 internet sales, researched by internet retailer and confirmed by retailers. this report includes company financial, operational and performance data, as well as vendors in key categories. aleva stores ranked on the list at 601,

addition of the three online stores brought the total online retail sites aleva stores operates to nine. the larger warehouse will allow better organizing and storing of inventory for each online
