use this guide to cross-reference the length, diameter, and gauge size of your jewelry (refer to the illustration above). common measurements although not every piercing is the same, most piercings have a couple of different gauge sizes. if you're looking for new body jewelry and aren't sure which gauge size is right for you, reference this average gauge sizing chart. however, your piercer will always know best. frequently asked questions whether you're buying body jewelry for the first or the hundredth time, you likely have questions about how to clean your new product or how to figure out which size is right for you. at spencer's, we know jewelry inside and out. read on for all the answers to your most pressing questions and customer support options. what's the difference between externally and internally threaded barbells? simply put, the difference is in how the balls are screwed onto the bar. for internally threaded pieces, the ball screws into the bar. for externally threaded pieces, the ball screws onto the bar. what's the best way to store my jewelry? the most proper way to store jewelry is by keeping it in a fabric-lined box. some jewelry storage cases even use a special anti-tarnishing fabric that will help keep your favorite pieces looking new for longer. how do i know what gauge size i need? a gauge is the diameter of the jewelry and the length is measured based on the insertable piece of the jewelry. it's also important to keep in mind that different types of jewelry can be used on various parts of the body. spencer's carries a wide range of jewelry and gauge sizes to fit your piercings perfectly. our jewelry clearly indicates gauge size in mm on all packaging, and online in our product descriptions, so you'll easily be able to find the perfect piece. if you're unsure about your gauge size, reference the chart above or ask your piercer for official sizing. when looking for new jewelry, we recommend ensuring that your piercing is healed before browsing for new jewelry. it's also important to know what type of body jewelry you're looking for and what types of materials you want to wear in your piercing to avoid sensitives or allergies. what material is used to make your jewelry? we carry a number of different materials in our body jewelry assortment, which are listed below. it is important to note that some of our metal styles may contain base metal alloys in their decorative features. surgical steel - this metal has a low level of impurities but is not entirely nickel-free. this is commonly used for new piercings. g23 titanium - this metal is a better option for individuals with sensitive skin or known allergies to base metal alloys. it has a higher price point because of its quality. titanium jewelry may have decorative features containing base metal alloys. astm f-136 titanium - this line of high-grade titanium is hypoallergenic and is featured in our body sensitive line. this line retails at a higher price point because it is internally threaded, features swarovski gems and semiprecious stones, and the entire piece of jewelry is comprised of astm f-136 titanium (including decorative features). this is the best option for customers with nickel allergies or sensitive skin. bio flex - this material is trademarked, hypoallergenic, medical-grade plastic that is flexible and can be sterilized. this is another great option for sensitive skin acrylic - this versatile, lightweight plastic is a great option for making a fashion statement. however, the plastic does not withstand prolonged wear and tear. acrylic pieces should be handled with care and not over-threaded. silicone - this material is implant-grade, pliable, stretchable and good for sensitive skin. glass - a good and durable option for sensitive skin as it does not contain nickel. it should be handled with care. organics - natural materials such as wood and stone that are naturally porous, which means they can hold onto bacteria - they should only be worn in healed piercings and are generally used for plugs and stretched ears. how do i stretch my piercing? there are many different methods for stretching your piercing, but we recommend that you reach out to your piercer for further assistance. how long will it take my piercing to heal? everybody reacts and heals differently, so we can only provide a general timeframe for how long it may take for different types of piercings to heal. it is best that you speak with your piercer before getting pierced to discuss how to properly care for your new piercing and how long you should wait before trying to change your jewelry. some of your pieces state they are anodized. what does this mean? an anodized item means that the metal has been treated to an electrolyte bath in order to change the color. have specific questions? check out the inspo spot for more body jewelry content and tips. happiness guarantee at spencer's, we take our customers'
