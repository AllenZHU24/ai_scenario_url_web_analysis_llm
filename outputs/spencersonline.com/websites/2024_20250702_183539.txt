services product information lava-lamp product information commonly asked questions q: what is a pre-order? a: a preorder item is an item listed on our website for sale but delivery is not expected into our warehouse until a future date. a guest can place an order for a preorder item and spencer’s will not charge your card until your order processes and ships to you. please be advised pending transactions may be placed on your card by your bank/credit card company weekly. these pending holds typically fall off in 2-3 business days. q: what if i have a specific question about a product? a: item number: the item number identifies the specific product you are currently viewing. you can use the number when you want to go back and search for the specific product. product description: contains specific information and contents associated with the product. size chart: if available, a link may be located in the product description on the specific item that can help you determine which size will best fit you. product reviews: product reviews offer opinions from actual customers who have purchased the specific item in the past. q: i was able to add the product to my cart, but it disappeared when i went to check out. a: well... unfortunately, our website is not always capable of refreshing as quickly as we would like. so even though an item may say it is available, if you can't add the item to the cart, the item is out of stock and will most likely be updated within 24 business hours. q: my lava lamp arrived cloudy. what should i do? a: sometimes due to transit you may occasionally receive a cloudy lava lamp. if the lamp arrives cloudy run it for 6-8 hours a day for seven consecutive days. make sure that the lamp has had the chance to completely cool down before turning it on again. cloudy globes are not considered defective. general product information q: when do you restock your website? a: we have general estimated restocking dates based on the season... swimwear, flip flops, cover-ups: march hats, belts, belt buckles: july backpacks, laptop cases, school products: july pajamas, blankets, winter wear: september q: i was able to add the product to my cart, but it disappeared when i went to check out. a: unfortunately, our website is not always capable of refreshing as quickly as we would like. so even though an item may say it is available, if you can't add the item to the cart, the item is out of stock and will most likely be updated within 24 business hours. q: if i can't find the item online, can i get it at the store? a: to find the item you want in a store near you, contact us via the live chat link at the top of our website. please have the item number and your zip code handy so we can check the stores in you area to see if they carry that item. body jewelry support q: how do i know what gauge size i need? a: please keep in mind that gauge sizes can vary between manufacturers as there is no universal regulation on companies to make a standard size for body jewelry. that being said, body jewelry can differ anywhere from .5mm to 1mm. if you are unsure of your gauge size please consult your piercer before purchasing more jewelry. remember, the higher the gauge size the smaller the wire. please refer to our jewelry guide for general guidelines on the gauge sizing for some of the more popular piercings. again, we suggest you refer to your piercer before you make any decision concerning your piercing. q: what material is used to make your jewelry? a: the two most common materials found in our body jewelry are surgical steel and acrylic. surgical steel is implant grade metal and hypoallergenic but not recommended for those allergic to stainless steel. other materials we use are: silicone bioplast - biological plastic that is flexible and metal free. organic - this material includes wood, stone, shell, horn, or bone. usually organic pieces are hand-carved. glass - hypoallergenic and nonporous. q: how should i clean my body jewelry? a: the best way to clean jewelry is to use antibacterial soap and water. do not use alcohol or anything similar! it can ruin your jewelry by melting the acrylic or discoloring it. be careful with gold items as they can easily tarnish in alcohol or peroxides. tarnished gold can sometimes turn body jewelry black when worn. remember to clean it again before it goes back into your piercing! q: how do i stretch my piercing? a: there are many different methods for stretching your piercing, but we recommend that you reach out to your piercer for further assistance. q: how long does it take for my piercing to heal? a: everybody reacts and heals differently, so we can only provide a general timeframe for how long it may take for different types of piercing to heal. it is best that you speak with the piercer before getting pierced to discuss how to properly care for your new piercing and how long you should wait before trying to change your jewelry. you can use our jewelry guide for general guidelines on how long some of the more popular piercings take to heal. q: how do i select the correct piece of jewelry for my piercing? a: below is a chart with some of the most popular piercings and what types of body jewelry are commonly used with each piercing. we suggest that you speak with your piercer first if you are unsure what type of jewelry you need before making your purchase. piercing styles cartilage captive hoop, barbell, cartilage stud, cartilage barbell, labret ear lobe captive hoop, horseshoe (circular barbell), plug, tunnel, pincher, taper, hanger, studs, spiral eyebrow curved barbell, captive hoop, horseshoe (circular barbell) labret labret stud, lippy loop, captive hoop industrial industrial bar lip captive hoop, horseshoe

barbell, pincher, d-ring tongue barbell tragus cartilage stud, twist, captive hoop, cartilage barbell horizontal hood piercing (hch) captive hoop, d-ring vertical hood piercing (vch) captive hoop, banana, barbell, d-ring q: how do i care for my piercing? a: we recommend that you speak with your piercer about the proper care for your piercing. q: some of your pieces state they are anodized. what does this mean? a: an anodized item means that the metal has been treated with an electrolyte bath in order to change the color. lava lamp support q: my lava lamp arrived cloudy, what should i do? a: sometimes due to transit you may occasionally receive a cloudy lava lamp. if the lamp arrives cloudy run it for 6-8 hours a day for seven consecutive days. make sure that the lamp has had the chance to completely cool down before turning it on again. cloudy globes are not considered defective. q: my lava is not flowing like it should. a: lava lamps operate best at 69 degrees fahrenheit and on a flat and stationary surface. if the lava is not flowing as anticipated the lamp may be getting too hot or too cold. make sure that the lamp is not placed in front of any windows or a cooling/heating unit or vent. you may also want to check and make sure the bulb is installed properly. q: my globe is dotted with light. a: since the globe is made of glass it may contain air bubbles and maker’s marks. this is perfectly normal and not a defect. q: the lava color is not what i expected. a: the lava color may be darker than anticipated, but after a few runs the color will start to lighten. also, please keep in mind that you are combining two colors. for example, even though the lamp states yellow lava and blue liquid, the lava may have a greenish tint. do not place the lava lamp in front of a window as this will cause the colors in your lamp to fade. q: the coil is floating in my lamp. a: keep your lamp operating for about 4 hours or until all the lava is melted and the coil should automatically drop back to the bottom of the lamp. if the coil does not drop down, then twirl the globe gently in the base and the coil will drop. do not shake the lamp. q: my light died, what bulb do i need to replace it? a: view the chart below to find the replacement bulb needed for your lamp. 10" and 11.5" 8 and 12 oz globe 15 watt (sewing machine bulb) 14.5" 20 oz globe 25 watt (refrigerator bulb) 17" 32 oz globe 40 watt a15 (appliance bulb) wizard 32 oz globe 40 watt snn1 16.3" 52 oz globe 40 watt a15 (appliance bulb) 27" 250 oz globe 100 watt 100r20f (floodlight bulb)

adult products? a: yes! your order arrives in discrete packaging. the spencer’s name and logo will be on the outside of the package. for deliveries to canada, apo/fpo and other military bases, please be advised the contents of your order are required to be listed on the outside of your package for delivery to us military bases and through canadian customs therefore discreet packaging is not permitted for these deliveries. q: do i need to remove the small white tab in the battery compartment? a: most battery-operated products have a paper tab that must be removed before use in order to power up the product. q: do i need to remove the white paper cylinder in the battery compartment? a: if there's a white paper cylinder wrapped around the batteries, do not remove it. the manufacturer adds this component to hold batteries in place and prevent the vibrator from rattling. q: how do i know if the batteries are properly installed? a: once the small white tab is removed, ensure that the batteries are facing in opposite directions when loaded and you should be good to go. q: i twisted the vibrator to power it up and it's not working. is it broken? a: do not over-twist the battery cover when powering up a vibrator as this may cause the toy to malfunction or break. q: how do i extend my sex toy's life? a: cleaning your product with toy cleaner after each use is essential. it's also important to remove batteries when your vibrator's not in use to ensure peak lifespan and performance. if the toy's not powering on or running on low power, try replacing old batteries with fresh ones. q: why does my sex toy have a weird odor? a: some toys may absorb a subtle scent during production. to dissipate, clean with soapy water or toy cleaner before first-time use. q: how do vibrators work? a: each battery-powered vibrator has an electrical motor and off-center weight that spins around at a fast pace causing it to shake. some of our more powerful vibrators are larger, plug-in models that use spinning electromagnetic coils to create that pleasure-inducing movement you've been seeking. q: do all vibrators feel the same? a: quick answer: no. each vibrator has a unique intensity level that's determined by the quality, material and type of motor. plug-in vibrators typically have stronger motors and a higher intensity because they're directly connected to a main power source whereas batteries weaken over time. q: how do i stimulate my gspot? a: everyone's body is different, but in most cases, it's all about finding the right angle. after inserting the vibrator 2-3 inches into the vagina, angle the dildo or vibrator up towards your belly button; that's where the g-spot is located. rule of thumb: you're doing it right if you feel like you have to pee while pressing up. the good news is that some toys are masterfully crafted with a curved and/or ridged silhouette that angles up to reach your g-spot. when you insert these specially designed models and pull them forward into position, the curved tip should deliver vibrations directly to your g-spot. q: how do i stimulate my prostate? a: after applying a substantial amount of lube, insert a dildo or vibrator about 2-3 inches inside your rectum, angling it towards your belly button and pressing against the inner wall of your rectum. feeling experimental? try a t-shaped vibrator that's specially designed to aim straight for your prostate. if you feel the urge to pee after stimulation, no worries; this means you're doing it right! note: be sure to use toys with a flared base when experimenting with anal play. if you experience severe pain, stop immediately. q: what is a multi-function vibrator? a: true to its namesake, a multi-function vibrator stimulates different pleasure points simultaneously and in more than one way. certain models produce more than one type of vibration: some throb, pulse and vibrate steadily; others have a rotating shaft/head or bead compartment that turns. the rabbit vibrator is the most popular type of multifunction vibrator, commonly known for its ability to stimulate the vagina and clitoris at the same time. q: what kind of lubes should i use? a: water-based lube is the safest, most common option because it's non-irritating, easy to clean off and compatible with pretty much all types of sex toys and contraceptives. flavored, edible water-based lubricants are also popular and fun, though they may contain yeast-encouraging sugar and glycerin. silicone-based lubes are typically more expensive and harder to wash off, but they last longer than water-based lubes. although silicone versions are safe to use with latex contraceptives, they cannot be used with silicone sex toys due to silicone-on-silicone reactions. we do not recommend using oil-based lubes in the vagina as they can cause infection and irritation. still confused or concerned? test out the lube on a small area of sensitive skin (elbow or inner thigh) to see if a reaction occurs. q: how do i know if my sex toy is safe to use in a bath, hot tub or shower? a: don't use a vibrator in a bath or hot tub unless the packaging or product description clearly indicates that it's waterproof. some of our toys are labeled as "splash proof", but those models cannot be submerged under water. note: never bring a plug-in sex toy into the bath or hot tub. q: what are the best batteries to use in a vibrator? a: we recommend that our customers use alkaline batteries as they're designed to give you a few more hours of battery life. rechargeable batteries are environmentally friendly, but they take time to charge. do not try to recharge regular alkaline batteries; this may cause them to explode. for smaller sex toys that require watch-like batteries, lithium-ion batteries are the preferred type. q: how long will the batteries last? a: there's no black-and-white answer as battery life can range anywhere from 10 hours to 50 hours depending on the frequency of use and the amount of power the device drains. smaller models tend to have small motors, which drain less power than a larger toy with multiple moving parts. we recommend that our customers invest in rechargeable batteries if they're purchasing a large, multi-functioning toy as you won't have to buy new batteries as often. the best way to extend the battery life is to remove the batteries from your toy and store them separately when it's not in use. q: i'm having trouble getting my sex toy to work. who do i call for support? a: our intimate support team is ready to help! we also have late-night support 7 days a week! simply click on the live chat link at the bottom of our page or feel free to contact us at 1-800-762-0419 (option 5) between the hours of 11 am-9:30 pm,
