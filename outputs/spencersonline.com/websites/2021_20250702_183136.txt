how we give back in addition to the company's retail presence, spencer's has taken the frontline in the battle against cancer by fundraising on behalf of three organizations dealing with cancer issues for young people below the age of 40. since 2008, our non-profit organization boobies make me smile has collected almost $4mm to support organizations like the young survival coalition, stupid cancer and fxck cancer--all of which work toward prevention, education, and support of young people with cancer. if you'd like to learn more about these charities and how you can donate, click here. email sign upbe the first to find out about great store specials and online deals!
