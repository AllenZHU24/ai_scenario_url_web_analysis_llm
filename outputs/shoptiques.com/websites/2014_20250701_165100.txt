delicate as its natural counterparts, acetate should still be handled with care and responds best to dry cleaning. acetate fibers are hypoallergenic, so it is a great option for the sensitive shopper! acrylic one wonders why there was such an uproar several years ago, when scientists in france cloned a sheepâ€”with acrylic, textile manufacturers have been cloning wool for decades! this man-made version of wool has the same look as the original, but is much easier to care for, and can even be put in the washing machine! however, its warmth does not quite equal that of the original. wear it all winter, but layer up! bamboo straight off the hanger, this fabric already has the lived-in feel of your favorite cotton tee, but without having to go through a dozen washingsâ€”itâ€™s no wonder this is known as an eco-friendly fabric! because it absorbs 3 to 4 times as much moisture as cotton, bamboo is a great option for cotton lovers with sensitive skin! cashmere a favorite luxury fabric traditionally manufactured in asia and the middle east, cashmere offers its wearer the advantage of looking dressy while feeling as if they left home wrapped in their favorite blanket! indulge in the softest variation of wool, just take good care of your cashmere by hand washing it or having it dry-cleaned. cotton there is a reason yankee candle co. has a scent named for this fabricâ€” cotton is the very definition freshness and breathability! comfy, versatile, and easy to care for, cotton will always be a preferred fabric of designers and consumers alike. just be wary of shrinkage and remember to cold-water wash! leather one of the worldâ€™s oldest fabrics, leather is durable despite its buttery soft feel. we all know that genuine leather is made from animal hide, and it should be treated with as much care as you treat your own skin. to keep your leather looking its best find the right cleaner and conditioner! linen linen has the raw, fibrous look of a handmade sheet of paper, with the same delicate texture and soft feel. donâ€™t let the fact that this fabric is easily wrinkled deter you from embracing it into your wardrobeâ€”comfortable and light, linen is the perfect fabric for the summer season! lycra while lycra never takes the lead it is great in a supporting role! always paired with another fabric, lycra increases flexibility, allowing for a better fit and greater comfort and freedom of movement. best of all it is durable, allowing clothes to keep their original shape through years of washing and wear. remember, as with many good things, a little lycra goes a long way! metallic youâ€™d never guess that this fabric is man-made from metal-like fibersâ€”itâ€™s too delicate! add this fragile fabric to your wardrobe for a healthy dose of glamour and shine! modal cottonâ€™s cousin, modal is equally comfortable with the same natural feel. however, its greater water absorbency means that instead of shrinking, modal actually stretches over time. while still light and thin, modal is slightly warmer than cotton. so enjoy this cotton substitute, just remember it wears differently over time! mohair also known as angora, after the goats whose hair it is woven from, mohair is as soft to the touch as cashmere, but with a fun, fuzzy texture. flame-proof, stretchable and durable, donâ€™t think twice about adding this fine wool fabric to your closet! nylon imagine a rubber bandâ€”no matter how far you stretch it out, it always snaps back to its original shape. nylon is equally flexible and resilient! a man-made fabric, nylon combines extreme elasticity with the look and feel of silk. stock up on nylon leggings, dresses and skirts for going out! polyester made entirely of synthetic fibers, polyester offers advantages that most natural fabrics do not, such as heightened wrinkle-resistance and durability. second only to cotton in popularity, you probably already have plenty of polyester in your closet! polyurethane polyurethane is a waterproof fabric that was created from a cotton poly blend and is both extremely durable and lightweight. great fabric choice for a cropped jacket for the beginning of the fall season. rayon like nylon, rayon is another man-made, silk-like fabric. it won the moniker â€œimitation silkâ€? because it is so similar in look and feel. buying rayon is like splurging on salon highlightsâ€”no one has to know itâ€™s not natural! silk who among us does not know and love silk? one of natureâ€™s softest fabrics, silk has a lustrous sheen that instantly connotes luxury! of course, we also all know how delicate silk is. handle silk garments with care, and hand wash or dry clean them only. soy you enjoy soy in the kitchen, why not enjoy it in your closet too? itâ€™s good for you, and it looks good on! a functional, eco-friendly favorite, soy makes for a lightweight fabric with a silky-feel that has earned it the name â€œvegetable fabric.â€? throw it on for a look that is both luxurious and environmentally friendly. spandex/elastane the favorite fabric for designers of swim sweats, athletic wear and tights, spandex/elastane combines smooth texture with stretchy breathability. the perfect combination of comfort and functionality! tencel a lightweight, breathable fabric, that is surprisingly soft and drapable when you consider it is made from wood pulp! shrink-proof and wrinkle resistant, tencel is a versatile fabric that is easy to care for. viscose a more refined relative of rayon, viscose has the same silk-like look and feel, but itâ€™s breathable like cotton! since rayon wrinkles easily and is prone to shrinkage, be gentle with this fabric and always cold water wash. wool warm and cozyâ€”wool is the ultimate winter fabric! although it is known for having a coarse, sometimes itchy texture, wool in the right blend and weight is the perfect material for crafting everything from jackets and sweaters to capes and even blankets! customer care
