no, all prices on shoptiques.com are the same as they are in the boutiques. we require full price transparency between what stores are charging customers at their physical boutiques as on shoptiques.com. what is the “pick-up in store” shipping option? if the boutique is on your way home, or you are going to be in the boutique’s area in the near future, you can purchase the item online and select the option to “pick-up in store”. this will ensure the item is reserved for you and when you arrive at the store, you can try it on and pick it up. all “pick-up in store” options can be returned right there at the store or exchanged for another item. an item is out of stock. will you be getting more in stock/is there a way i can still order it? because most of shoptiques.com items are unique or one-of-a-kind, we do not restock most pieces. however, our customers’ happiness is very important to us, so if you email our stylists at stylist@shoptiques.com, we will do everything in our power to work with a boutique to find you that special piece. why do i have to register to make a purchase?

how can i check the status on it? most orders ship within 2 business days of purchase. shipping times may vary due to availability of merchandise. orders are not shipped on the weekends or holidays. as soon as your order ships, you will receive an email confirmation with tracking details to the email address you entered when ordering. if for some reason you did not receive an email, please check your spam folder and add support@shoptiques.com to your safe-sender list. you can also check your order status by signing into your account on our website. where do you get all the merchandise? where is it made? all of the merchandise is selected by the boutique owner's. many boutiques carry their own label or buy from emerging, niche or local designers. each has a distinctive style that reflects the owners’ discerning eye and creative vision. many boutique owners also search the globe to bring you the most unique items from indie designers all over the world. i had an item in my shopping cart and continued to shop, and when i tried checking out, the item was sold out. why did this happen? items placed in your shopping cart, unfortunately, are not held or reserved for you until you submit your order completely. given all of the pieces are unique and available in very small quantities, they sell out quickly, so if you find something you like we recommend purchasing it as quickly as possible to avoid competition from other shoppers online and at the actual physical boutiques. however, we will try our very best (pinkie swear!) to find you that item, so just email us at support@shoptiques.com. i received my order, but i am missing an item/this is not what i ordered. how can we fix this? please note that your order will come in several shipments as each boutique ships your order separately. if after receiving all of the boxes, you are still missing an item, please email us at support@shoptiques.com. we aim to get your order right every time but we do occasionally make mistakes. if we have made a mistake, we will reimburse you for all of the shipping costs and will ensure you receive the right item. we will probably send you a surprise for all of the trouble! who doesn’t love little surprises! is there a sales tax charge? great question! because shoptiques.com aggregates the most extraordinary boutiques from all over the world, the sales tax will depend on the city, state and country of the boutique’s location and your shipping address. what is the “talk to stylists” feature? how can stylists help me? our stylists are fashionable trendsetters who are ready to help with any style or fashion advice. uncertain about the fit of an item, what’s appropriate to wear for an occasion you are planning, or how to wear this piece or what to pair it with? we’re here to help! send us your picture or what inspires you, and a stylist will work with you one-on-one to find the best boutique fashions to fit your dreams and lifestyle! customer care contact us shipping information returns & exchanges size & fit guide gift cards faqs invite friends, get $15 the company about us careers press affiliates privacy policy terms & conditions boutiques new boutique sign-up create a website boutique login #shopstagram our boutiques don't miss out © copyright 2011 - 2015 shoptiques, inc. all rights reserved. made with in nyc. usd hello, united states! shoptiques.com is the one-and-only place to shopthe world’s best boutiques online. take advantage of: free shipping on orders over $100 24/7 help we’re here to answer all your questions: support@shoptiques.com or call (646) 368-9685 start shopping we've added it for you! continue shopping checkout × added to your bag proceed to purchase
