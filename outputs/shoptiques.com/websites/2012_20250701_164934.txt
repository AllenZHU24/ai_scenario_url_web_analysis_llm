lycrawhile lycra never takes the lead it is great in a supporting role! always paired with another fabric, lycra increases flexibility, allowing for a better fit and greater comfort and freedom of movement. best of all it is durable, allowing clothes to keep their original shape through years of washing and wear. remember, as with many good things, a little lycra goes a long way! metallicyou’d never guess that this fabric is man-made from metal-like fibers—it’s too delicate! add this fragile fabric to your wardrobe for a healthy dose of glamour and shine! modalcotton’s cousin, modal is equally comfortable with the same natural feel. however, its greater water absorbency means that instead of shrinking, modal actually stretches over time. while still light and thin, modal is slightly warmer than cotton. so enjoy this cotton substitute, just remember it wears differently over time! mohairalso known as angora, after the goats whose hair it is woven from, mohair is as soft to the touch as cashmere, but with a fun, fuzzy texture. flame-proof, stretchable and durable, don’t think twice about adding this fine wool fabric to your closet!

rayonlike nylon, rayon is another man-made, silk-like fabric. it won the moniker “imitation silk” because it is so similar in look and feel. buying rayon is like splurging on salon highlights—no one has to know it’s not natural!

a functional, eco-friendly favorite, soy makes for a lightweight fabric with a silky-feel that has earned it the name “vegetable fabric.” throw it on for a look that is both luxurious and environmentally friendly. spandex/elastanethe favorite fabric for designers of swim sweats, athletic wear and tights, spandex/elastane combines smooth texture with stretchy breathability. the perfect combination of comfort and functionality! tencela lightweight, breathable fabric, that is surprisingly soft and drapable when you consider it is made from wood pulp! shrink-proof and wrinkle resistant, tencel is a versatile fabric that is easy to care for. viscosea more refined relative of rayon, viscose has the same silk-like look and feel, but it’s breathable like cotton! since rayon wrinkles easily and is prone to shrinkage, be gentle with this fabric and always cold water wash. woolwarm and cozy—wool is the ultimate winter fabric! although it is known for having a coarse, sometimes itchy texture, wool in the right blend and weight is the perfect material for crafting everything from jackets and sweaters to capes and even blankets!
