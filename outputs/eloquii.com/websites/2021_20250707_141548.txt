to make a return, please contact our customer experience team at customerservice@eloquii.com international shipping timeframes most international orders are received within 6-10 business days. expedited shipping is not available for international orders. eloquii is not liable for any delays in international transportation or customs clearance. shipments can be delivered directly to most addresses, except post office boxes. however, in certain remote areas, there may be an additional delivery charge or you may need to pick up your package from the closest service point of our shipping partner. additional international order costs total cost calculations and international shipping are brought to you by eloquii's partner, borderlinx.* the total cost includes: - the product purchase price (including any applicable local taxes and handling fees); - customs duty, import tax and any local clearance fees applicable for your country; - international shipping charges to your designated delivery address; and - shipping company surcharges for most countries, you will pay for the product and the cross-border delivery in a single checkout on our website. the total cost is guaranteed -- it is pre-calculated and pre-paid so you won't receive any bills from the shipping company or a customs invoice. for a few countries, it's not possible to pre-calculate and pre-pay the tax and duty when you buy the product; for those countries, you will need to pay tax and duty on delivery. note that you are purchasing the product(s) from eloquii, not from borderlinx. eloquii's terms and conditions apply to the product purchase. the clothing and accessories offered by eloquii can be shipped internationally. however, some products could possibly be subject to certain import restrictions specific to your country. customs duty and tax customs duty and import tax are specific to a particular country. customs authorities in each country calculate duty and tax based on a number of factors, including: - the category in which the product is classified in the international harmonised code(hs) system; - the value of the product (the price you paid); for most countries, duty is calculated on a “cif" basis (meaning cost, insurance and freight), so - - the shipping charge you pay will also be factored in to the calculation of the duty that will be charged. for countries where tax and duty is pre-calculated and pre-paid, you will generally not see customs paperwork. you should be aware that the actual tax and duty charged by the customs authorities in your country sometimes turns out to be higher or lower than the amount you paid, for a number of reasons. for example, a particular customs authority may classify your product in a different category in the harmonised code (hs) system from the category used by the total cost calculator, or your local customs authorities may (for whatever reason) use a different formula to calculate the duty, or the calculation may be affected by a change in currency exchange rates between the time of our calculation and the time the tax and duty is paid to customs authorities, or items may be changed or cancelled after customs and duties have been calculated and paid. in such situations, you will not receive a refund (if the amount is less) or be charged extra (if the amount is greater). as the recipient of the package, you are the “importer of record" and you appoint borderlinx as your agent to manage all export, import and customs clearance procedures and to ensure that applicable customs duties and taxes are paid to the relevant customs and tax authorities in your country. although borderlinx handles eloquii's shipping to canada, the uk, france, and australia, your point of contact for item delivery or to make arrangements for a return is eloquii at customerservice@eloquii.com or 1-844-693-5678. claims be sure to check the details of your purchase carefully before checking out, and check the contents of the package(s) promptly upon receipt. if you have a problem with the product, contact eloquii customer service to find out about return shipping arrangements. how to make a claim for loss or damage during shipment no matter how carefully a package is handled, there are occasions when a package may be lost or the contents damaged during international shipment. fortunately this doesn't happen very often. liability for eloquii international shipments is limited to direct loss or damage only (actual cash value). all other types of loss or damage are excluded (including, but not limited to, lost profits, income, interest or future business). if your package is lost or damaged in international transit, you will need to submit a claim within 14 days of the date of delivery, or within 14 days of the date you received confirmation that it was lost. email us to make a claim. * "borderlinx" and "total cost calculator" are trademarks owned by borderlinx, and they
