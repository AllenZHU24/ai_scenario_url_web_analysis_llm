why wasn’t the fashion industry creating more for bodies like hers than stretchy black pieces, dowdy oversize frocks, and cheaply made clothes that barely last a season? she spoke for curvy women everywhere. we heard you we created eloquii to give full-figured women the fashionable clothes they long for. we listened to what women want (and don’t want), conducted extensive research into body shapes and sizes, and applied the limited’s style and design savvy to the process. then we kept at it until we got it right. we think you’ll love what we came up with. “the making of eloquii” the eloquiidifference fashion is forevery body eloquii celebrates your fashion sense and showcases your individuality by giving you well-made clothes that fit and look great.we’ve taken the uncompromising fit and fashion standards of the limited and tailored them to deliver versatile pieces that get noticed in all the right ways. this is fashion designed for you and inspired by you. from size: up to size: fit that flatters every piece in the collection has been designed from the start for you. we used multiple fit models—real customers of different sizes and shapes—to guide the process. and we started with a size 18 and graded up and down from there. so the clothes feel and look great whether you’re a size 14 or 24. we know the little things that make a big difference in fit, such as adjusting sleeve lengths, inseams and waist levels by size to both flatter and provide coverage. we offer two pant fits to allow for differences in body shapes and style preferences. how does an eloquii size 14w fit compare tothe limited size 14?
