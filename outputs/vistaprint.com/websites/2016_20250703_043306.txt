affordable prices, along with design tools suited to every skill level and need, mean everyone can create the customized materials they need to get their message across. and it all started the way most businesses do, with one entrepreneur’s ambitious goal. about 20 years ago, robert keane wanted to give small business owners access to the same high-quality, custom-printed products that bigger companies (with bigger print budgets) enjoyed. he developed a patented technology that delivers professional-quality printing in small quantities, affordably. next, he took a process that was traditionally only available offline and made it possible for business owners to create and order their custom materials online – from the convenience of their own computers. millions of customers (and billions of business cards) later, we’ve greatly expanded our offerings and advanced our technology, and our commitment to helping you promote your business is stronger than ever. we’re confident you’ll be 100% satisfied with our products, quality, design experience and attentive service. in fact, it’s absolutely guaranteed. “anyone with the passion, ambition and spirit to run a business
