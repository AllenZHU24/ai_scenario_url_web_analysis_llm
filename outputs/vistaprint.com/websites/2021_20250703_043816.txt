disappointment!submitted aug 20, 2020 by cjk from illinoisi worked with their design team, i upgraded the paper and expressed my desire for the highest quality. the process was a disaster as their website denied access due to their technical issues so it was delayed. the logo is so small you cannot read it. the circle around it - not part of the design- is visible and the quality of the paper- premium- is pathetic. this is the program for my only daughters wedding- in a very difficult time- thanks for making it worse vistaprint! it would be one thing if i never used yiur design people- but i consulted them numerous times. and i used you to print stickers where the logo is legible and properly sized. so there is no excuse for this.response from vistaprint customer care team:we're so sorry the wedding programs were not as expected. we understand your disappointment and apologize for any inconvenience caused. because they did not work for you, we'll be processing a refund for the programs and an email will be sent confirming this. again, we terribly apologize for the experience you've had - tgrmore detailsproduct quality2product value2ease of design1displaying reviews 1-5/
