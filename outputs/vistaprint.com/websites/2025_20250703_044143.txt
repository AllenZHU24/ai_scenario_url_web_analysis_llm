product. for water- and tear-resistant packaging, especially for clothes and similar items, try our poly mailer envelopes, which are also available with a 100% compostable material. our shipping mailers are made from white kraft paper, while our corrugated cardboard features a white exterior and comes in either b-flute or e-flute. you can learn more about what materials and other options are available by going to the individual product pages.will my shipping box arrive assembled? your boxes will arrive flat to preserve space but they have a straight-forward assembly process, just follow our easy step by step video guide in the overview section.can i order custom-branded boxes or envelopes with my logo? yep! you’ve come to the right place. you can add your logo to all of the boxes and envelopes on this page. you can also customize our mailing accessories, like self-adhesive tape or return address labels, to give plain packaging a branded touch.can i order a single custom box? yes, you can order a single custom shipping box or order a pre-printed sample to check for size.which shipping options do you recommend for retail and e-commerce? that depends on your style and business needs. if you’re looking to impress customers with a unique unboxing experience, we recommend mailer boxes. for heavier products or bulky items that need extra protection, we recommend using shipping boxes. for lightweight items like textiles, documents, clothing and gift vouchers, we suggest poly mailers and cardboard envelopes. aside from those, there are plenty of other shipping solutions available on this page, so take a look to see what works best for you.are your boxes and envelopes suitable for use with ink stamps? yes, we have custom ink stamps for boxes and envelopes. for envelopes, we recommend our self-inking or signature stamps. for anything larger, our packaging stamps are your best bet.how do i properly dispose of or recycle your packaging materials? we use fsc® certified paper and offer 100% compostable material options for our poly mailers. there is a strong chance you will be able to recycle any paper or cardboard packaging you order with us. still, different locales have different rules, so it’s always best to check with local councils or recycling plants.are your boxes and envelopes suitable for international shipping? our shipping boxes can insulate your goods well enough during shipping overseas. unfortunately, we currently do not offer envelopes specifically designed to ship abroad.you need it. we print it. you love it. vistaprint is
