are business cards?that depends on the shape you choose. here’s a rundown of our business card sizes by shape: standard: 3.5" x 2" rounded corners: 3.5" x 2" square: 2.5" x 2.5" circle: 2.5" diameter oval: 3.5" x 2" leaf: 3.5" x 2" note: square and circle business cards exceed the height of a standard wallet. consider one of our other options if you’re looking for wallet-sized business cards. also, when you’re designing or choosing a template, remember that business card dimensions may include a “bleed area,” which is extra space for images, patterns or design elements that extend beyond the cut edges – this helps prevent having white edges around your finished card. see our business card size guide for detailed info on business card sizes in pixels, bleed area and more.how thick is a business card?business card thickness is usually measured in “points,” abbreviated as “pt.” the higher the number, the thicker the card. standard business card thickness is 14pt, but weights can vary by paper type. for instance, our ultra thick business cards are actually 32pt, and our premium plus cards come in at 18pt.how do i design a custom business card online?it can be hard to know where to start when you’re creating a new card online. but with vistaprint, you can quickly browse ready-to-use templates in a range of styles. when you find something that fits your needs (and personality), you can add your own custom text, logo and even images. then, you can fine tune the font, layout and even colors until you’re satisfied. and you can always check out your card in a 3d preview to make sure everything’s just right. looking for business card inspiration? take a peek at some of our favorite design examples.what are the most important elements to include on a business card? every business is different, but there are a few things anyone should have on their card. you’ll want to include your name, the name of your business, your contact info and your logo. then, you can also add optional elements like photos, artwork, customer testimonials, a brand motto and more – whatever you think will connect with potential customers and business partners.should i put anything on the back of my business card? you don’t need to, but you certainly can. some people put their logo or slogan on the backside of their card. others will list their company website or hours of operation for quick reference at a glance. and there are lots of other options, too – coupons, photos, artwork and more. in fact, here are some of our customers’ favorite ideas for how you can use the back of your business card.how quickly can i receive my order? we have a variety of delivery options, including economy, standard and express. check out our shipping guide for more details.can i order sample business cards?yes. our free business card sample kit includes examples of unique paper stocks, finishes shapes and more.what material and finish should i use for my custom business card?you want to find something that matches up well with both your industry and your personality. thicker, heavier stocks can work well for businesses trying to project strength and reliability. more textured, unique finishes are a great choice for craftspeople and artists. and if you go for a standard or rounded corner business card, finishes like embossed gloss and foil accents can help almost any design be extra eye-catching. looking for something a little extra durable, eyecatching or, well…just plain extra? we also offer alternative options like plastic business cards, painted edge business cards and even nfc-enabled smart cards.what do i do with old business cards?if the information is still mostly correct, you can keep them as backups by crossing out the out-of-date info and writing in new text. if the cards are mostly inaccurate, we’d recommend recycling them.how do i organize business cards?we’d recommend using one of our business card holders, available in an assortment of different materials and styles.how should i organize the information on my business cards?traditionally, business card designs have a horizontal layout, but if you’re going for a different, modern feel, we have a lot of templates for vertical business cards, too. as far as specific design layouts, we have thousands you can quickly sort and browse by industry, shape, style and more. if you’re looking for more specific pointers, check out our guides on how to design a business card and tried-and-true business card layouts.are special finishes like embossed gloss and foil accents available on both sides of my business cards? the front of your card will have whatever texture or finish you selected. the back will be a smooth, matte surface – great for adding notes, appointments or other information. special finishes are available with standard and rounded corner business cards.do you offer holders and cases for my business cards?yes. you can choose from a variety of styles, materials and
