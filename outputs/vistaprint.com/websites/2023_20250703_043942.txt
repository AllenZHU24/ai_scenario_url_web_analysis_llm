production time of your order and the delivery. are your shipping times guaranteed? when you add an item to your cart, you’ll be asked to choose a shipping speed. after that, we’ll show you the promised arrival date for your item – and we stand by that. bad weather and carrier delays can happen, but if your order doesn’t get there on time and you’re not satisfied, neither are we. contact us and we’ll make it right. do you offer free shipping? we offer free shipping within the us (excluding alaska and hawaii) on orders greater than $100 before taxes and after any discounts are applied. through vistaprint proadvantage, a subscription program for print resellers, premium customers receive flat rate shipping and free delivery on orders over $60, along with product discounts. you can learn more about the program here. do i get tracking info? where can i find it? once your order ships, we’ll send you a shipment confirmation email that includes the delivery method, estimated arrival date and other tracking details (if available). you can also go to your order history to look up tracking info. which shipping carriers do you use? we use a variety of shipping carriers, including united states postal service, ups and fedex. we determine which carrier to use for your order based on a variety of factors, such as products purchased, shipping address, size/weight of the order and delivery speed selected. can i arrange for my own shipping provider / courier to deliver my order? we’re sorry, but because of our production process, we can’t accommodate special shipping requests. is there a way to pick up my package? yes. where available, you are able to choose an eligible pickup point for your delivery. to view eligible locations, select “pickup point” in the shipping address field at checkout. do you ship internationally? which countries do you deliver to? yes, international shipping is available to the following destinations: austria, belgium, switzerland, czech

qualify for international shipping. do you ship to apos and mpos? right now we can’t, but we’re looking into how we can ship to military addresses. my package was supposed to arrive today, but i have not received it yet. what should i do? packages are delivered by 8pm in your time zone daily. if it is not yet 8pm you can view your tracking information in your order history under my account. you can also contact us at any time, and we’ll be glad to assist. what if my package is returned to the sender? if the carrier was unable to deliver your order and it was returned to our manufacturing
