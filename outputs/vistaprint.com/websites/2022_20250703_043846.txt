pixels we also offer square cards or rounded corner cards, which are a little different than the typical business card size. also, when you’re designing or choosing a template, remember that business card dimensions may include a “bleed area,” which is extra space for images, patterns or design elements that extend beyond the cut edges – this helps prevent having white edges around your finished card.how thick is a business card?business card thickness is usually measured in “points,” abbreviated as “pt.” the higher the number, the thicker the card. standard business card thickness is 14pt, but weights can vary by paper type. for instance, our ultra thick business cards are actually 32pt, and our premium plus cards come in at 18pt.how quickly can i receive my order? we have a variety of delivery options, including standard, priority and express. check out our shipping guide for more details.what do i do with old business cards?if the information is still mostly correct, you can keep them as backups by crossing out the out-of-date info and writing in new text. if the cards are mostly inaccurate, we’d recommend recycling them.how do i organize business cards?we’d recommend using one of our business card holders, available in an assortment of different materials and styles.how do i pick a business card layout?traditionally, business card designs have a horizontal layout, but if you’re going for a different, modern feel, we have a lot of templates for vertical business cards, too. as far as specific design layouts, we have thousands you can quickly sort and browse by industry, shape, style and more.if i add a special finish to my card (like embossed gloss or foil accent), will it be on both sides?the front of your card will have whatever texture or finish you selected. the back will be a smooth, matte surface – great for adding notes, appointments or other informationdo you offer holders and cases for my business cards?yes. you can choose from a variety of styles and materials, along with some customization options, right on our business card holders page.
