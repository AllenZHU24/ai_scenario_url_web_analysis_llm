easy step by step instructions installing ceiling fans is a great way to lower energy costs and add style or functionality to any room. a ceiling fan can help create a "wind chill" effect during the summer and help distribute warm air evenly throughout a room in the winter. before installing a ceiling fan: locate the ceiling joist or other suitable support in the ceiling. make sure you can identify and connect wires. make sure you can lift at least 40 lbs. make sure the floor to blade clearance is going to be at least 7 feet. electric code requires all ceiling moving ceiling fan blades to be at least 7 feet from the ground. flush mount fans are a good choice for ceilings between 7 and 8 feet. these directions are for installations with an existing junction box. first, check the carton your ceiling fan came in, hunter fans and other name brand fans include detailed installation instructions for your fan. hunter fans install documents can also be downloaded online./li> turn off electrical power at the circuit breaker box - turn the power off to the circuit that the fan will be on before starting installation of a fan. assemble the ceiling fan - follow the specific assembly instructions that came with the unit you are installing. ceiling fan assembly varies model to model. in most models you can turn the motor over in the styrofoam packaging so that the top of the motor faces you. unbundle the three motor wires. feed the motor wires through the hanger ball/downrod assembly and set the downrod in the top motor coupling. loosen the square head set screw on the top motor coupling to install the downrod and ball assembly. once the downrod and ball assembly are installed tighten the set screw. note: the setscrew must be properly installed as described above, or fan wobble could result. use the screws and grommets to secure flange to blade. repeat for the remaining blades. turn motor over to mount blades note: blades can be installed before or after hanging the fan motor in place. attach one blade assembly to the motor hub using appropriate screws.do not tighten screws completely at this time. install the remaining blade assemblies in the same way. gently snug all flange screws to the motor hub, working around the hub in a clockwise sequence. securely tighten all flange screws, again working around the hub in a clockwise sequence. note: failure to follow this procedure could result in fan wobble. step 2-4 step 2-6 hang the ceiling fan securely attach the mounting bracket to the outlet box using the two screws supplied with the outlet box. pull the wires through the center hole. carefully lift the fan and set the hanger ball/downrod assembly on the hanger bracket that is attached to the outlet box. be sure the groove in the ball is lined up with the tab on the mounting bracket. warning: if you are mounting large ceiling fans, verify that you are using a supported ceiling fan mounting box. all heavy and large ceiling fans require extra support for safety. warning: mounting bracket must seat firmly against outlet box. if the outlet box is recessed, remove wall board until bracket contacts box. if bracket and/or outlet box are not securely attached, the fan could wobble or fall. warning: failure to seat tab in groove could cause damage to electrical wires and possible shock or fire hazard. wanring: to avoid possible fire or shock, do not pinch wires between the hanger ball/downrod assembly and hanger bracket. wanring: mounting fans in an exterior location requires a ul rated outdoor ceiling fan. verify that the damp or wet location you are installing the outdoor ceiling fan in is the correct ul rating of the fan. step 3-1 wire the ceiling fan -
