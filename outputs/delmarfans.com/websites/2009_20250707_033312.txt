lighting brands that have us based product designers usually have a better quality light fixture. us based designers understand the quality, styles, and standards of products offered in america. international decorative lighting designers (except most european designers) do not fully understand the typical expectations of the us consumer when it comes to buying lighting. yes, us designers create a better final product, but these brands are less likely to have discount light fixtures. does the lighting brand have a product warranty? most good decorative lighting brands have a finish integrity warranty of one to two years and also have a structural warranty of two to four years for all of there lighting fixtures. this should especially hold true if shopping for coastal light fixtures. what determines a quality discount light fixture? when you buy lighting online there are so many lighting distributors, how would you determine which one has the best discount lighting fixtures? to start, most lighting brands today have unilateral pricing policies that keep all of the prices advertised online consistent. when an online lighting distributor violates a pricing policy set by the lighting manufacturer, the online distributor risks losing that product line. online discount coupons have grown in popularity over the years. before you buy lighting, call and ask for a discount coupon or if they sell discount light fixtures. you can receive up to 5% off of selected lighting products. if you enter coupon5 in the coupon code area on your shopping cart with del mar designs, you will receive a 5% discount. these coupons do not apply to protected unilateral prices unless the lighting manufacturer has authorized its use. to buy lighting solely based on a discounted price may not always be the best approach to fulfilling your home lighting ideas. the online lighting distributor should have a flexible return policy that will easily assist you in returning the light fixture you purchase if you do not like it. look for a no restocking fee return policy so there won't be any extra charges. customer service delivery ship times contact us designer discount about us return policy find pitch of your ceiling tech support fan tips privacy policy product info buy ceiling fans buy lighting table lamps wall sconces outdoor lights ceiling light fixtures all brands install a fan product rating secure shopping guaranteed no hassle returns no restocking fees 110% low price guarantee © 2003-2009 del mar designs, inc. - (800) 724-5501
