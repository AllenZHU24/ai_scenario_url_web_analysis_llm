ya'll correct my shipping address earlier with no hassle either, thanks!!!! danny o., 10/4/2012 some of our lights arrived the day after i ordered them and the rest arrived the following day! they are already up and look great. thanks for your superior customer service! ellen s., 10/4/2012 i will be another three weeks before the under deck will be completed and the two fans installed but we just wished to thank you for the wonderful experience with your sales staff while we worked through this purchase. you set an extremely high standard when it comes to expertise, service, and customer interaction. bob n., 9/27/2012 ive received the package on time, thanks a lot. your service is remarkable! itay c., 9/27/2012 our cordova fan arrived today. we won't have time to take it out of the box b/c we have the house torn up for remodeling. but, may try to check it out later this week. anyway, i wanted to thank you for working with me during the last two months while i was waiting on the fan. it sure made me less nervous knowing where it was in the process. little things like that are really appreciated by customers. i can't give you a tip or hug, so all i can do is thank you for going that extra mile. danell l., 9/19/2012 thanks - you have the best customer service i have come across in years!! keep up the good work and we will be buying from your company again. vickie a., 8/28/2012 i can't say enough about your service though. you did everything you said you would do in the time you said you would. i appreciate it very much. patrick g., 8/22/2012 hi, my name is kevin, i just received the part they sent under warranty. just wanted to thank you guys, it's working perfectly, and again, it was the remote control module, for the hunter fan. just wanted to thank you again, i appreciate how quick it was getting the part to me, i will do business with you in the future, thank you. kevin r., 8/20/2012 just a short one, i love my fans!

lew j., 6/18/2012 very helpful and promptthanks very much vicki c., 6/8/2012 jasonmany, many thanks for your e-mail - the information provided is way beyond the call of duty! declan m., 5/30/2012 i purchased a set of the ambience 12123-0 table lamps which were lost by fedex. i immediately contacted delmar customer service upon notification of delivery and they arranged for immediate replacement. i received my replacement lamps within 48 hours and they are simply beautiful. i will definitely be ordering from this company again!! so glad i found them :). amadi e. l., 5/30/2012 thank you! we appreciate how simple that was to complete. this is another reason we will keep coming back to del mar designs. we will actually be ordering more items from del mar later this week. thanks, again. mark k., 5/24/2012 your service was exceptional thanks terry m., 5/23/2012 thanks - the other shpments have been great and i appreciate your wonderful service!

great people in del mar lighting!! thank you!! mary ann c., 3/11/2012 thank you so much jeff!! you make this all very easy!! great to do business with you!! maryann c., 2/14/2012 hi, i just wanted to tell you that, after looking at dozens of other internet sites, i am ordering from delmar because you have (by far) the most comprehensive and accurate product information available, in additional to an easy to understand and navigate web site. thank you from an avid internet shopper! you've made my life much easier. tina c., 12/12/2011 please be sure to credit jason with this order, he has been a prince ever since we first embarked on this ceiling fan experiment and i would personally urge anyone who needs customized (and above all intelligent) help to call delmar and ask for jason directly. we simply couldn't have managed this without you!! skye m., 10/21/2011 thanks a lot! i want you to know that when i was initially looking at ceiling fans i sent you (or someone at your store) a question as to whether this fan has a reverse switch. i promptly got an email back saying yes, with a photo of the switch.now that's good service, i thought. and so i bought the fan from you. john b., 9/12/2011 thanks so much for your help. the fan works great...i'll be sure to reccommend delmar. jeff c., 9/10/2011 i placed the order for our system. i cannot thank you enough for your patient, professional and extremely valuable assistance. you are a true asset to del mar and i hope your employers are aware of that. in the future, if i should need other products your company provides, you can be sure i will go first to del mar. thank you again for all your hard work and patience in working with david and me. you are very much appreciated!!! michael m., 8/19/2011 thank you, cynthia!my husband installed it this last weekend. it works! and it looks great!thank you for standing by your product. amy b., 8/19/2011 i tried to go online to the sales site to write a review, but didn't find exactly where to do it. so, i'm emailing to let you know how very very pleased i am with my purchase.i happened to see a similar fan at a local lowes. i came home and googled the brand. through that process, i came across your company---one that "i" wasn't familiar with. but, i took a chance. as i stepped through the ordering process and recognized the site going secure i was more comfortable. the followup email from you also eased my anxiety of dealing with an unfamiliar company. then when my fan arrived, i immediately checked the contents of the box and found everything to be of great quality and true to the online picture and description.but the absolute best part----i turned off all my house power and hung it myself!!! i'll never do that alone again, because the fan is extremely heavy (to me) and i was fortunate that i didn't drop anything! but i read and reread the instructions and proceeded exactly as the instructions directed. i had a red wire in my ceiling that didn't match any on the fan, so i had to call my little brother to find out what to do with that one!! i was nervous when i turned the power back on and when i turned on the fan for the first time. the fan is absolutely beautiful, it's quiet, it's just wonderful!!thank you for your sales/shipping professionalism and for marketing such a fine product!! sharon b., 8/17/2011 wow! we already received our fans. i ordered the fans on july 11th and had them sitting at my door on july 14th!! this is awesome!!! ordering the same fans through lowe's would have cost us $200 more dollars and it would have taken us over a month to receive our fans. thank you so much and consider yourselves our new fan source. lena d., 7/14/2011 thank you very much for sending replacement fans! my husband and i are extremely impressed with your customer service! we understand that it is not your company's fault that the hunter fans we brought are loud. however, you have been far more responsive to our complaint about them than hunter was when i contacted them. they wanted me to find the manufacture date from the top of the motor (which is not on the external housing) and call them back to decide what to do further. what a pain. you were simply willing to make the exchanges. we hope these are as are quiet as we expect so i can just send you the "old" fans and not have to deal with hunter any further. hopefully they will give you a credit.my husband will be traveling for the next two weeks so he will install the new ones after he gets home. i will wait for the shipping label to send you the noisy ones.thank you again for your amazing customer support. it is rare to find these days. we will gladly recommend you to our family and friends! nancy t., 7/7/2011 jeffrey, you are a miracle worker. thank you so much for your help and patience this afternoon, and again, my apologys for all the phone calls.please also convey my appreciation to your manager. these kinds of gestures are very much appreciated by customers and definitely help when deciding to place more orders. i will be sure to let my family and friends know how well i was treated by del mar. kathy t., 6/28/2011 installing the emerson midway eco fan was more complicated: it arrived from del mar designs, (delmarfans.com) without a parts bag. for nearly $450 (with free shipping) a fan ought to come with all its two-penny screws and pins.after a no-hassle phone call to del mar, the company contacted emerson, which shipped a replacement bag overnight. the fan was blowing on the first 90-degree day of the year. new york times, 6/16/2011 over the past two years, i have purchased four ceiling fans from you for my home in hinesville, ga. each purchase experience was significantly enhanced by the superb service and support i received from your customer service representatives - jay and jason. as a retired business person, i tend to take a much more critical view of the customer support i receive from a merchant. during each purchase and follow-up, jay and jason exceeded my highest expectations. i give them my highest recommendation for customer service and support: they are outstanding. michael p. s., 6/7/2011 i just received my fan! thanks for going the extra mile. i'll be brining my business back to you. one of the best experiences (if not the best) i've had in many many purchases over the internet. thanks again, todd b., 5/31/2011 thanks for your quick response and resolution.this is my first order with your company...impressed so far. gerry c., 5/23/2011 you guys are awesome.many thanks! valerie j., 5/10/2011 i just want to write some good words to your service.i just received 8 lightings i've order to delmar designs, and everything was well wrapped, and all the glasses are in excellent condition.so i am very happy with your service, i had good price for ordering 8 items, a good price of shipping (to canada), everything in very good condition, an the items are the same i was waiting for, identicals as the pictures of the web site.thank you very much, and if i need others things, you can be sure i'll order again in the future!thank you manon b., 4/29/2011 we received the fan yesterday evening, the electrician has installed it and everything seems to be working fine. thank you again so much for your attention to this matter and excellent customer service. i will certainly recommend your company to anyone else looking for these type items and remember you all in the future. tammy m., 4/18/2011 thank you for your effort in finding the information for me. because of your excellent customer service assistance, i will be purchasing the fan from you, and not from another vendor who was not as helpful in answering my questions. it seems customer service today is not what is used to be, and i appreciate it when a customer is treated well, which you have most certainly done. thank you, and please continue with your excellent service. bill c., 4/18/2011 fans | lighting | light dimmers | light bulbs | brands | exhaust fans | ceiling fan tips | lighting tips about us | contact us | returns | privacy | delivery times | designers | site map © 2003-2012 del mar designs, inc. - 800-724-5501 mon - fri: 9am - 6pm, sat: 10am - 4pm
