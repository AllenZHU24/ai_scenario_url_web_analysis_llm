for small rooms and large ceiling fans for large rooms, or so they say. while this may sound like an ancient proverb, choosing the right size ceiling fan ensures maximum performance, style, and above all – comfort. here’s how you can select the correct ceiling fan size for any room in your home. how to choose an outdoor ceiling fan almost nothing beats sitting on your porch, sipping cold iced tea under the cool breeze of an outdoor ceiling fan. however, there are some important factors to look for when choosing an outdoor ceiling fan. to get the most out of your fan, first you need to understand the difference between indoor and outdoor ceiling fans. what is the right size downrod? a ceiling fan downrod is a metal pipe that connects the motor housing to the mounting hardware, stabilizing the ceiling fan and reducing the potential for wobbling. the right size downrod also aids in proper airflow by ensuring a safe distance between the ceiling fan blades and the ceiling, at least 8 – 10 inches, and between the fan blades and the floor, a minimum of 7 feet. how to install a ceiling fan installing a new ceiling fan is a thrifty way to reduce your energy bills without sacrificing comfort. a fan installation is a perfect weekend project for any avid do-it-yourselfer because it only requires a few hours to complete, and the payoff is immediate. you don't have to be a home improvement expert to install a ceiling fan, del mar fans & lighting's videos and instructions below can help you get started. the benefits of ceiling fans when purchasing a ceiling fan, we often assume that its only purpose is to make us feel more comfortable. we hardly ever think about anything besides how much a fan costs and how much air it produces. many people are unaware of the other benefits, such as annual savings due to decreased energy usage and year-round comfort, that come along with owning a ceiling fan. read more... the next time you’re in the market for a ceiling fan, be sure to take full advantage these benefits: decreased energy usage- when running, an average central air conditioning unit uses approximately 2,500 watts of energy to operate. however, running a ceiling fan uses approximately 65 watts of energy to operate- a 97% difference in energy consumption. interested in saving even more energy? choose a ceiling fan that is energy star rated and 50% more efficient than standard ceiling fans. savings- ceiling fans use less energy and cost less to operate than your standard central air conditioning unit. see the savings a ceiling fan can generate by looking at your monthly electric bill. while savings may vary depending on location, some homeowners have reported annual savings of up to $500. year-round comfort- a ceiling fan can provide comfort all year round; simply remember to change the direction of the blades. in the summer, run the fan in a counter-clockwise direction to produce a cool breeze. in the winter, run the fan in a clockwise direction to push warm air down to the floor. types & styles of ceiling fans ceiling fans have come a long way since their invention in the 1800’s, and the fans of today are a vast improvement both
