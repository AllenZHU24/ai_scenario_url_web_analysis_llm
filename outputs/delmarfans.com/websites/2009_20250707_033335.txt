view all manufacturer tech support numbers below the following are questions and answers of ceiling fan repair problems that have occurred in the past. del mar designs can solve any ceiling fan problem you run into. if the ceiling fan manufacturer can not solve the problem or we can not solve the problem, we will send you out the same ceiling fan you purchased from us at no charge. call 1(800) 724-5501 and ask for tech support to assist you with your problem. why won't my ceiling fan spin in the reverse direction? many of our ceiling fans come with either a remote or wall control that has the ability to select the reverse or forward direction of the air flow from the control. in very rare occurrences when you press the reverse / forward button nothing happens. if this is the case with your ceiling fan, then you have a defective receiver module. call del mar designs (800) 724-5501 with your invoice number and ceiling fans model number. we will then send out a new receiver module for your ceiling fan. sometimes my ceiling fan turns on by itself? remote controlled ceiling fans come from the factory with default frequency dip switch settings. on the remote and the receiver there are frequency dip switch settings that must be the same for each the transmitter and the receiver. each unit has four sets of on/off switches that determine what setting the frequency is on. when you receive a new fan with a remote the default settings are set to 1-on, 2-on, 3-on, and 4-on. if you have other ceiling fans in the house that are operated by remote then the frequency settings might be the same. so, every time the other ceiling fan is turned on the other is too. this applies to apartment buildings too; most likely the frequency settings are the same as the other ceiling fans in your apartment building if this problem is occurring. you can change the frequency dip switch settings on the ceiling fan remote and ceiling fan receiver that is turning on by it self. why does my ceiling fan wobble on high speed? after a ceiling fan is newly installed it should be run on high speed to verify the integrity of the installation. most of the time if there is a wobble on high speed it is due to certain nuts and screws of the ceiling fan not being tightened enough. or the junction box in the ceiling is loose. this problem can be solved by simply removing the canopy that is flush with the ceiling and checking to make sure that the junction box is taught. the junction box in the ceiling should be properly fastened to or between two ceiling joists. then one by one tighten all of the screws and bolts that connect the ceiling fan mounting bracket to the junction box. also, tighten all the screws that hold the fan blades to the ceiling fan motor. if this does not solve the problem then use the blade balancing kit that came with your ceiling fan. every ceiling fan is packaged with a blade balancing kit. this kit has detailed instructions on how to balance the blades using lead weights to eliminate the wobble. ambience 1-866-262-4110 www.minkagroup.net casablanca 800-715-0393 www.casablancafanco.com cosmopolitan 800-715-0393 www.casablancafanco.com emerson 800-237-6511 www.emersonfans.com et2 lighting 1-800-574-6873 www.et2online.com fanimation 888-567-2055 www.fanimation.com hinkley 216-671-3300 www.hinkleylighting.com hudson valley http://www.hudsonvalleylighting.com/ hunter 800-676-7861 www.hunterprestige.com lithonia lighting 1-888-557-4676 http://www.lithonia.com/ lutron 1-888-588-7661 http://www.lutron.com/ matthews fan co 847-680-9043 www.matthewsfanco.com minka energy star 1-800-307-3267 www.minkagroup.net minka outdoor 1-800-307-3267 www.minkagroup.net minka-aire 800-307-3267 www.minkagroup.net minka-lavery 1-800-307-3267 www.minkagroup.net modern fan co 888-588-3267 www.modernfan.com monte carlo 1-800-519-4092 http://www.montecarlofans.com/ murray feiss 1-800-969-3347 www.feiss.com quorum www.quoruminternational.com savoy house 800-801-1621 www.savoyhouse.com tech lighting 1-800-522-5315 http://www.techlighting.com/ tommy bahama 800-237-6511 www.tommybahama.com wpt design 847-680-9043 http://www.wptdesign.com/ no hassle return policy (no restocking fees) we assure you that we can provide a solution for your situation. first be sure to inspect every nook and cranny of your product carton immediately upon receiving it. if you have received a defective product contact the manufacturer's technical support telephone number first (this number is usually enclosed with the manual information within the box or click the tech support link on delmarfans.com). the manufacturer's technical support staff can solve most fan motor problems or lighting fixture problems quicker than we can. if they cannot solve the problem contact del mar designs @ (800)-724-5501 and del mar designs will replace the defective product. you have to contact del mar designs within 60 days from the date that the order was received. after 60 days there will be no refund or exchange. please note that del mar designs will only issue credit for products that have not been installed. before returning any products please contact del mar designs to get a rga form emailed to you. del mar designs will refuse product or packages without an rga form within or attached. not satisfied and want to return product once you have received your product and you decide you are not satisfied, what do you do?
