your current home decor. we’ve given a few tips to help you avoid buyer’s remorse and help you buy the perfect one for your home. purchasing ceiling fans should be an easy process, so we’re working

choosing the correct size ensures maximum performance, style, and above all – comfort. here’s how you can select the correct ceiling fan size for any room in your home. what is the right size downrod? a ceiling fan downrod is a stainless steel pipe that connects the motor housing to the mounting hardware, stabilizing and reducing the potential for wobbling. the right size downrod also aids in proper airflow by ensuring a safe distance between the fixture’s blades and the ceiling, at least 8 – 10 inches, and between the fan blades and the floor, a minimum of 7 feet. design your own fixture

purchasing a fan, we often assume that its only purpose is to make us feel more comfortable. we hardly ever think about anything besides how much a fixture costs and how much air it produces. many

the market, be sure to take full advantage of these benefits: decreased energy usage - when running, an average central air conditioning unit uses approximately 2,500 watts of energy to operate. however, running a fan uses approximately 65 watts of energy to operate- a 97% difference in energy consumption. interested in saving even more energy? choose an energy star rated ceiling fan to get 50% more efficiency than a standard ceiling fans. choose led light bulbs for extended light bulb life and efficiency. savings - ceiling fixtures use less energy and cost less to operate than your standard central air conditioning unit. see the savings an efficient fan can generate by looking at your monthly electric bill. while savings may vary depending on location, some homeowners have reported annual savings of up to $500. year-round comfort - a fixture can provide comfort all year round; simply remember to change the direction of the blades. in the summer, run the fan in a counter-clockwise direction to produce a cool breeze. in the winter, run the blades in a clockwise direction to push warm air down to the floor. types & styles ceiling fans have come a long way since
