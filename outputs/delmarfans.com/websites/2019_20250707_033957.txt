energy usage - when running, an average central air conditioning unit uses approximately 2,500 watts of energy to operate. however, running a fan uses approximately 65 watts of energy to operate- a 97% difference in energy consumption. interested in saving even more energy? choose an energy star rated ceiling fan to get 50% more efficiency than a standard ceiling fans. savings - ceiling fixtures use less energy and cost less to operate than your standard central air conditioning unit. see the savings an efficient fan can generate by looking at your monthly electric bill. while savings may vary depending on location, some homeowners have reported annual savings of up to $500. year-round comfort - a fixture can provide comfort all year round; simply remember to change the direction of the blades. in the summer, run the fan in a counter-clockwise direction to produce a cool breeze. in the winter, run the blades in a clockwise direction to push warm air down to the floor. types &
