central ac unit uses roughly 2,500 watts to operate, that is a whopping 97 percent difference in energy consumption. select a fan that is energy star rated, which is 50 percent more efficient than traditional fans. year-round comfort – ceiling fans are suitable for use throughout the year as long as homeowners change the direction of the fan’s blades during the summer and winter seasons. in the summer, run the fan in a counter-clockwise direction to produce a cool breeze, and in the winter, run the fan in a clockwise direction to push warm air down to the floor. this allows residents to be less reliant on air conditioning and heating units. to learn how to change a fan’s rotation during the summer and winter seasons, see our guide on ceiling fan direction. savings - ceiling fans consume
