to install a ceiling fan â step by step instructions installing a ceiling fan is a great way to lower energy costs and add style or functionality to any room. a fan can help create a "wind chill" effect during the summer and help distribute warm air evenly throughout a room in the winter. before installing a ceiling fan: locate the ceiling joist or other suitable support in the ceiling. make sure you can identify and connect wires. make sure you can lift at least 40 lbs. make sure the floor to blade clearance is going to be at least 7 feet. these directions are for installations with an existing junction box. turn off electrical power at the circuit breaker box - turn the power off to the circuit that the fan will be on before starting installation of a fan. assemble the ceiling fan - follow the specific assembly instructions that came with the unit you are installing. ceiling fan assembly varies model to model. in most models you can turn the motor over in the styrofoam packaging so that the top of the motor faces you. unbundle the three motor wires. feed the motor wires through the hanger ball/downrod assembly and set the downrod in the top motor coupling. loosen the square head set screw on the top motor coupling to install the downrod and ball assembly. once the downrod and ball assembly are installed tighten the set screw. note: the setscrew must be properly installed as described above, or fan wobble could result. use the screws and grommets to secure flange to blade. repeat for the remaining blades. turn motor over to mount blades note: blades can be installed before or after hanging the fan motor in place. attach one blade assembly to the motor hub using appropriate screws.do not tighten screws completely at this time. install the remaining blade assemblies in the same way. gently snug all flange screws to the motor hub, working around the hub in a clockwise sequence. securely tighten all flange screws, again working around the hub in a clockwise sequence. note: failure to follow this procedure could result in fan wobble. step 2-4 step 2-6 hang the ceiling fan securely attach the mounting bracket to the outlet box using the two screws supplied with the outlet box. pull the wires through the center hole. carefully lift the fan and set the hanger ball/downrod assembly on the hanger bracket that is attached to the outlet box. be sure the groove in the ball is lined up with the tab on the mounting bracket. warning: mounting bracket must seat firmly against outlet box. if the outlet box is recessed, remove wall board until bracket contacts box. if bracket and/or outlet box are not securely attached, the fan could wobble or fall. warning: failure to seat tab in groove could cause damage to electrical wires and possible shock or fire hazard. wanring: to avoid possible fire or shock, do not pinch wires between the hanger ball/downrod assembly and hanger bracket. step 3-1 wire the ceiling fan - if you feel that you do not have enough electrical wiring knowledge or experience, have your fan installed by a licensed electrician. verify power is off connect the green grounding wire from the fan and the green grounding wire from the mounting bracket to the grounding conductor supply (this may be a bare wire or a wire with green colored insulation). securely connect wires with wire connector supplied. note: if you are using a light fixture with your fan, see light fixture owner's manual for wiring. securely connect the fan motor white wire to the supply white (neutral) wire using wire connector supplied. securely connect the fan motor black wire to the first hot wire and blue wire to the second hot wire using a connector supplied. after connections have been made, turn leads upward and carefully push leads into the outlet box, with the white and green leads on one side of the outlet box and the black and blue leads on the other side of the outlet box. step 4-4 install the canopy align the slots in the canopy with the tabs or threaded screws on the mounting bracket. bring the canopy over the mounting bracket. turn the canopy clockwise until the tabs or threaded screws on the mounting bracket lock with the locks in the canopy. loosely secure the canopy screw into the canopy. once all screws are installed, tighten then securely. step 5-1 step 5-2 step 5-3 turn on electrical power pull chain note: run the ceiling fan on high speed to make sure the base is secure and there is no wobble. if the fan wobbles or is noisy, check out our how to balance a ceiling fan guide or our ceiling fan troubleshooting guide for other common ceiling fan problems. what is the recommended installation height for your ceiling fan? to determine your ceiling height, measure the distance from the exact spot in the ceiling where the fan is to be installed to the floor directly underneath. if your ceiling is below 8', then narrow your search to a hugger ceiling fan. for especially shorter ceilings (under 8'), consider hugger ceiling fans without lights, as they tend to be our lowest profile fans. fans should be suspended 8 - 9' from the floor. fan blades should be at least 7' away from the floor. lofty cathedral ceilings may benefit from more space.fans may look better if hung between 10 - 14'. fan blades should be at least 8 1/2" from the ceiling. if there is less space, airflow may be reduced. with high ceilings, you should lower the ceiling fan.this improves cool air circulation or heat reclamation.use this guide to decide what size downrod to use. lightingceiling
