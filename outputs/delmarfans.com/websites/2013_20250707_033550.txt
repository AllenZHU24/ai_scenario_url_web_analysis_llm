ceiling fans operate similarly to remote-controlled televisions. using a handheld device, homeowners can adjust the fan speed, the direction in which the blades rotate, and the degree of lighting. hand-held remote controls have gained popularity and manufacturers like hunter remote ceiling fans include the devices as a standard fan component. some ceiling fan remotes offer advanced settings like automatically dimming lights and adjusting speed after a certain time frame. remote controlled fans are available in a range of styles and finishes for indoor and outdoor applications. installing remote control ceiling fans is as easy as mounting traditional ceiling fans with an additional step. when installing a remote controlled fan, the signal receiver must be installed and wired into the fan canopy. however, this added step it not any more difficult than wiring the ceiling fan to the electrical grid. homeowners should confirm they have the appropriate batteries to power the remote. once the remote is powered, they should test the speed, reverse, and lighting functions. 3 helpful tips for your ceiling fan with remote control 1. why create a unique frequency code? don’t end up with a rogue fan that leaves you trying to perform an exorcism on your possessed appliance. factory settings for remote frequencies can be the same for multiple ceiling fan remotes. this means other remotes on that frequency can control your device. review your manual or ask your installation technician the best way to change your remote’s frequency. giving yourself a unique code will help in case your neighbor decides to get the same fan or you want to add another remote controlled ceiling fan to your home. 2. what do you do if you lose your remote? it happens, sometimes remotes get lost. it can be frustrating looking for a replacement but it’s actually a lot easier than you may think. sometimes it’s as simple as contacting the manufacturer, other times you will need to buy a universal remote for ceiling fans with lights and remote control then set the frequency on your fan to the same as on the remote. 3. how to clean your remote? it’s easy to keep your ceiling fan’s remote control away from nasty germs. pour everyday rubbing alcohol on a towel to make it damp (not soaked, wring it out if you need to.) gently rub the buttons and entire remote with towel. you can use q-tips on the buttons for an extra clean. be careful not to knock or shift the buttons. try to keep your remote covered when not in use so dust particles can’t get to it. article written by +colby harris
