(note: when you purchase the last of an item in stock, if you go back and browse our store, that item will now show a back order button instead.) any items showing the back order button next to them means that we are currently out of stock of that item, but have re-ordered it from our distributor. you may order any back ordered items by placing those items in your shopping cart and going through the checkout process. we do not require payment for back order items until the items arrive and are ready to ship. as soon as your back order items arrive in our store for purchase, you will receive an email that evening letting you know your back orders are in stock and ready for shipping. to purchase your shippable back order items, simply log into your account and start the checkout process. our web site will automatically ask you if you wish to include your shippable back orders in your order, and then you simply continue the checkout process the same as normal. if you do not wish to include them with that order, you may decide to skip including them, or just skip a couple of items for that order and they will remain on back order for your next order. important: you only have 7 days after your back orders arrive and are shippable to purchase them before they will be returned to our general inventory stock. for high demand back order items you may want to pick them up as soon as they arrive in stock. there are a number of items that we can order but do not carry in stock. if you are interested in ordering a special order item, please contact us and we will determine whether the item is in stock at our distributors. please note: we can drop ship special order items directly to you from our distributor for an extra fee of $5 (generally ups ground or air is the only shipping option available), otherwise we will ship the item to you as soon as it shows up from the distributor. order terminology during the processing of your order, you may see the following terms used to show the current status of your order: pending - when your order is in the 'pending' status it means that we have not yet begun order fulfillment. processing - when your order is in the 'processing' status it means that we have begun to process your order. this includes reviewing your order and approving it for fulfillment. order picking - when your order is in the 'order picking' status it means that we have approved your order for fulfillment, and are preparing to pull your items from our warehouse. important: orders cannot be canceled when they have reached order picking status. packing order - when your order is in the 'packing order' status it means that we have pulled your items from our warehouse, and are in the process of boxing your order for shipment. shipped - when your order is in the 'shipped' status it means we have shipped your order and it is now on its way to you. if you have any questions about the status of your order, please do not hesitate to contact us. continue shopping cart 0 items bestsellers 01.o'donnell #97t 1/8 off-road medium turbo... 02.o.s. p3 turbo glow plug "ultra hot" 03.deans ultra plug (1 pair) 04.protek r/c 5x10x4mm rubber sealed "speed... 05.o.s. p4 turbo glow plug "super hot" 06.team losi foam bladder compensator (4) 07.king headz traxxas slash 4x4 slipper bea... 08.deans female ultra plug (2) 09.de racing bumpskid (losi 8ight/8t/2.0) 10.deans male ultra plug (2) specials jconcepts cross hairs 1/8th buggy tires (blue) (2) map: $17.99 reviews not good at all!! burnt 3 of them already. no issues with c .. friday, july 16, 2010 copyright © 2010 a main hobbies. all rights reserved.all original wording and photographs used on this website are the property of a main hobbies, and may not be used without prior written consent.
