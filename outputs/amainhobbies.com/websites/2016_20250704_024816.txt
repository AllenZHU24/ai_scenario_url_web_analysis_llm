transmitter cases & inserts wish list faqthe wish list is designed to work similarly to your regular shopping cart. when you find an item you are interested in but are not yet ready to purchase, click on the 'wish list' button instead of the 'buy now' button. this will add the item to your wish list, which you can edit and modify as you please using the 'wish list' link at the top right of our web site logo. initially, you will have one wish list, called 'default'. however you can create additional ones as you choose, and rename them as you like. new wish lists (including the default one) are initially set as private, meaning only you can see them. searches for wish lists are possible via the public wish list search page. if you make a wish list public, it makes it easier for friends and family to find the things you want. or you can just send them a direct link to your wish lists, if you want to drop a subtle hint about what gifts you would like. to do this, just click the 'share' button on the wish list. we even support rss feeds for the more technically inclined. but remember, it's up to you to make a wish list public - we respect your privacy and won't share a wish list without your consent, so by default we assume you just want to use your wish lists to manage things you want to get for yourself. your wish list management page allows you to choose which of your lists are visible to the public, and also allows you to control how much information about you is shown when people search public wish lists. by default, the settings are to only show your customer id, country, and the names of your public wish lists. to make it easier for people to find you, you may like to click the 'privacy options' button on the wish list page and turn on the options to show your name, city, and zipcode, according to how you feel about having that information turn up in searches. (note: unless you set at least one of your wish lists to be be public, your account will not be returned in searches for wish lists.) once you have items in your shopping cart or your wish list, you can quickly and easily move items from one place to the other. if you have added an item to your shopping cart, and you wish to move it to your wish list, click the 'save for later' button to the left of the item in your shopping cart, and the item will be removed from your shopping cart and added to your default wish list. you can also move items between wish lists (assuming you have created additional ones) by clicking the 'move' button on the wish list page, or by dragging and dropping the items between wish lists. when you have a list of items in your wish list that you wish to purchase, log into your account and browse to your wish list. from the list of items in your wish list, you can select each item for purchase by using the 'buy now' button next to each line item. this will add the items to your shopping cart, ready for purchase. note that items are not removed from your wish list immediately. they will be removed from your wish list when you actually purchase them, unless you delete them yourself. resources & support faq: cancelling orders faq: gift vouchers faq: pre order products faq: rewards points faq: wish list customer service contact us amain vip rewards product returns sponsorship requests vip terms and conditions shopping help international shipping payments accepted privacy notice shipping & returns shipping restrictions company info about us employment store locations terms of use why shop with us? get connected join us on facebook follow us on twitter tune in on youtube team blog payments accepted: copyright © 2016 amain performance hobbies. all rights reserved.all original wording and photographs used on this website are the property of amain performance hobbies, and may not be used without prior written consent.
