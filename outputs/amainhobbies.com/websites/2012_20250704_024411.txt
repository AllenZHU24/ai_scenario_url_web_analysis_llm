(note: unless you set at least one of your wish lists to be be public, your account will not be returned in searches for wish lists.) once you have items in your shopping cart or your wish list, you can quickly and easily move items from one place to the other. if you have added an item to your shopping cart, and you wish to move it to your wish list, click the 'save for later' button to the left of the item in your shopping cart, and the item will be removed from your shopping cart and added to your default wish list. you can also move items between wish lists (assuming you have created additional ones) by clicking the 'move' button on the wish list page, or by dragging and dropping the items between wish lists. when you have a list of items in your wish list that you wish to purchase, log into your account and browse to your wish list. from the list of items in your wish list, you can select each item for purchase by using the 'buy now' button next to each line item. this will add the items to your shopping cart, ready for purchase. note that items are not removed from your wish list immediately. they will be removed from your wish list when you actually purchase them, unless you delete them yourself. continue shopping cart 0 items bestsellers 01.a main hobbies gray "big league tee" t-s... 02.a main hobbies gray "big league tee" t-s... 03.aka racing 1/10 2wd buggy closed cell re... 04.protek r/c 3.5mm "super bullet" gold con... 05.o'donnell medium (purple) sport glow plu... 06.o'donnell #99 1/8 cold glow plug (1) 07.ecopower "electron" 2s li-poly 30c hard ... 08.protek r/c 4.0mm "super bullet" solid go... 09.protek r/c traxxas connector to t-style ... 10.protek r/c universal radio case specials scratch & dent: blade stock canopy (300 x) $14.49 $12.49 reviews sure it's a good thich durable bumper, it just is to thick m .. monday, december 31, 2012 copyright © 2012 a main hobbies. all rights reserved.all original wording and photographs used on this website are the property of a main hobbies, and may not be used without prior written consent.
