however, they have a low color rendition and emit yellow light. they are typically used in places where color perception is not critical to save money on energy costs. low pressure sodium low pressure sodium (lps) bulbs are mostly used in europe for outdoor street lighting. lps bulbs have the lowest color rendition of all hids, emitting monochromatic yellow-orange light. however, they are the most energy-efficient hids, making them ideal in places where color rendering is not critical. changing the way the world buys lighting sign up for deals sign up for deals stay connected stay connected quick links clearance coupons all categories shop by brand lighting resources help see all help returns shipping warranty faq contact us accessibility company about us employment apply for credit other links blog diy projects adobe reader 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. returns shipping warranty coupons contact © 2022 1000bulbs.com | all rights reserved. 1475 republic pkwy ste 100 mesquite, tx 75150 terms and conditions | new privacy policy | do not sell my info terms | new privacy | do not sell my info g-377333682
