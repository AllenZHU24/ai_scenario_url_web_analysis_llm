smoke, gas, and carbon monoxide detectors become less effective over time. from 2009 to 2013, smoke detectors were present, but failed to operate in 8% of reported fires, resulting in a 21% fatality rate. even if the alarm sounds when tested, years of built-up smoke, grease, dust, and other debris can coat the alarm's sensor and lessen its ability to detect a fire or gas leak in a timely manner. because of this, the national fire protection agency (nfpa) recommends replacing the entire unit once every 10 years even if you've been diligent about replacing the batteries. decade long protection: tamper-proof smoke detector never change the batteries again! first alert's smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are available with sealed 10-year lithium batteries. california state law requires these tamper-proof designs for all smoke and carbon monoxide detector replacements. when the low battery chirps, simply replace the unit for another decade of worry-free protection. this is the best smoke detector for apartment buildings and rental homes, as many states hold the landlord liable for the upkeep, even when residents fail to replace the battery or disconnect the unit. should you choose battery-operated or hard-wired? most importantly, check the regulations in your area. homes built before 1992 generally aren't required to have hard-wired smoke detectors, and california requires 10-year tamper-proof, battery-operated detectors. because hard-wired alarms can be connected, a fire on the first floor can trigger an alarm on the second floor, giving you advanced warning to get out of the house if you're unable to hear the alarm over a tv or stereo. just remember that hard-wired alarms have a battery backup that needs to be tested regularly and replaced periodically. the battery backup is designed to sustain power to the device in the event of an outage. interconnectivity and retrofit accessories detectors need to be mounted in locations to sound at the first sign of smoke or carbon monoxide. for the elderly, vision or hearing impaired, additional auxiliary warning devices should be mounted closer to the bed and easily visible from other places in the room. relay modules can activate additional warning devices such as externally mounted bells, sirens, or stairway lighting. faqs for smoke, carbon monoxide, and explosive gas alarms here are some of the most frequently ask questions about smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and explosive gas alarms. what triggers a smoke alarm? smoke alarms are triggered when the sensors detect smoke in the air. there are several different types of smoke alarms, each designed to detect a different type of fire. some are better at detecting flaming fires that spread quickly, while others detect smoldering fires that might not have visible flames. what triggers a carbon monoxide alarm? a carbon monoxide alarm can be triggered by a variety of things. the most common triggers are malfunctioning gas appliances, air leaks, and a lack of indoor ventilation. what are the signs of a carbon monoxide leak? common signs of of a carbon monoxide leak include soot marks around appliances, persistent condensation on windows near gas appliances, visible smoke or the smell of exhaust fumes, trouble keeping pilot lights lit, gas-burning appliances have a yellow or flickering flame, and instances of unexplained dizziness, nausea, headaches, or confusions. what should i do if my explosive gas alarm goes off? if your gas alarm goes off, evacuate the premises immediately and do not use any electrical switches or phones. once you are safely away, contact your local fire department. where should i mount my explosive gas alarm? explosive gas alarms designed for propane should be mounted on the wall near the floor since propane is heavier than air. alarms designed for methane (natural gas) should be wall mounted closer to the ceiling. if you have a combination explosive gas alarm (both propane & methane), it should be mounted more in the middle. do smoke, gas, and carbon monoxide alarms work during power outages? many of these alarms have a battery backup that ensures they will continue to work if the power goes out. the batteries should be tested regularly to ensure they are working. what causes nuisance alarms? nuisance alarms can be caused by a variety of factors. false alarms for smoke, gas, and co detectors can be caused by insects, dirt & dust, steam, and humidity. low batteries or faulty sensors can also cause nuisance alarms. make sure your alarms are in the proper location and make sure they are free of dirt, dust, and cobwebs. you should also test your unit regularly and replace batteries as needed. the nfps recommends that smoke and co alarms be replaced every 10 years. most gas alarms should be replaced every 5 to 7 years. sign up for deals sign up for deals stay connected stay connected quick links clearance coupons all categories shop by brand lighting resources help see all help returns shipping warranty faq contact us accessibility company about us employment apply for credit other links blog diy projects adobe reader 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. returns shipping warranty coupons contact © 2024 1000bulbs.com | all rights reserved. 1475 republic pkwy ste 100 mesquite, tx 75150 terms and conditions | new privacy policy | do not sell my info terms | new privacy | do not sell my info g-824981673
