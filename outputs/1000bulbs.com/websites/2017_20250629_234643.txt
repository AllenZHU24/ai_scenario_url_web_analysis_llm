designed for tree trunks and columns. net lights are shorter and wider which is better suited for bushes and shrubbery. don’t forget about the holiday greenery. our selection of trees, wreaths, and garlands are available in unlit and pre-lit options. for the living room or lobby, we carry a wide variety of christmas trees from realistic pine, fir, and spruce trees to tinsel trees available in several color options. wreaths are a classic holiday addition for residential and commercial buildings. we offer a variety of sizes, styles, and colors for you to choose from. for mantles and banisters, browse our christmas garlands offered in a range of lengths, bulb quantities, and colors to customize your holiday celebration. need help with your holiday decorations this year? our lighting experts are available at 1-800-624-4488 to help you make your christmas really shine! changing the way the world buys light bulbs. sign up for deals sign up for deals email address stay connected stay connected twitter google+ youtube facebook blog quick links clearance coupons all categories shop by brand lighting resources help see all help returns shipping warranty faq contact us company about us press releases testimonials employment other links blog diy projects dallas sign repair adobe reader 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. returns shipping warranty contact © 2017 1000bulbs.com | all rights reserved. 2140 merritt dr, garland, tx 75041 use of this site signifies your acceptance of 1000bulbs.com terms and conditions and privacy policy terms | privacy okb-app-1 // db94554
