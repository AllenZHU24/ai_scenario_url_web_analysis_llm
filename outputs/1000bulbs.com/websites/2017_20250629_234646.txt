which is more efficient? led light bulbs for the win! when it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, leds surpass cfls by a wide margin. leds are instant-start with no warmup time needed. they work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. from standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, leds can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. as an added bonus, all leds are rohs compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs. led lighting options standard shape a19 - designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. standard and a-shape led bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights. 3-way led - a three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. if your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you. vintage led bulbs -

led tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. ranging in size from t5 to t12 and a variety of color temperatures, these led tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to led lighting easier than ever. these led tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent t8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. led tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light. led tape lights - for accents, alcove, and backlighting, led tape light is a fantastic choice. more flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of led tape light can bring any place to life. there are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source. shatter resistant led bulbs -

while lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. comparing an led bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. as a very ballpark figure for led wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need. lumens - lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. on average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. the variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. leds are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb. color temperature - your guide to how the light itself will look. lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000k being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000k will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. our lighting guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen. driver content - because of their design, leds do not typically run on ac voltage. many leds require some form of driver to convert the voltage from ac to dc for proper operation. the majority of socket-based led lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an led and a driver at the same time if it isn't self-driven. changing the way the world buys light bulbs. sign up for deals sign up for deals email address stay connected stay connected twitter google+ youtube facebook blog quick links clearance coupons all categories shop by brand lighting resources help see all help returns shipping warranty faq contact us company about us press releases testimonials employment other links blog diy projects dallas sign repair adobe reader 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. returns shipping warranty contact © 2018 1000bulbs.com | all rights reserved. 2140 merritt dr, garland, tx 75041 use of this site signifies your acceptance of 1000bulbs.com terms and conditions and privacy policy terms | privacy okb-app-4 // 03dd827
