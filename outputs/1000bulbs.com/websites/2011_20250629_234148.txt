leds (light emitting diodes) are one of today's most promising lighting technologies. led manufacturers make claims that, if true, could revolutionize the way we think about lighting. among these claims are: the lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date. life that exceeds that of some traditional lighting products by 20 times. no mercury, making them an even "greener" product than cfls (compact fluorescents). light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products. can all these claims be true? as with any new technology, there is a rush by manufacturers to create the most appealing led product on the market. with such a rush, some led manufacturers poorly construct their product and often make false claims. stores that carry leds may also rush and jump to carry inferior products, leaving their customers disappointed. 1000bulbs.com is not one of those stores. we at 1000bulbs.com evaluate every led product on our website by a number of rigorous criteria detailed in our 1000bulbs.com led vendor questions. we judge each product by its technical claims and most importantly, by its real-world practicality. for that reason, 1000bulbs.com has the best led lighting selection the internet has to offer, and it is a selection that grows every day. if you are thinking about buying led products from 1000bulbs.com or any other source, we encourage you to consider asking our 1000bulbs.com led customer questions. we also encourage you to consult leds: the promise & performance which explains these issues in more detail. email specials sign up to receive specials & promos click here. 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. quick links home page my account clearance all categories customer service contact us returns shipping warranty privacy policy faq company about us testimonials employment dallas signrepair follow us blog.1000bulbs.com reviews © 2011 1000bulbs.com 2140 merritt dr., garland, tx 75041 | all rights reserved. serlit-web3.1000bulbs.com // v1.41.2-18-g87f4b7c
