leds (light emitting diodes) are one of today's most promising lighting technologies. led manufacturers make claims that, if true, could revolutionize the way we think about lighting. among these claims are: the lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date. life that exceeds that of some traditional lighting products by 20 times. no mercury, making them a "green" alternative to cfls (compact fluorescents) that contain mercury. light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products. can all these claims be true? as with any new technology, there is a rush by manufacturers to create the most appealing led product on the market. with such a rush, some led manufacturers poorly construct their product and often make false claims. stores that carry leds may also rush and jump to carry inferior products, leaving their customers disappointed. 1000bulbs.com is not one of those stores. we at 1000bulbs.com evaluate every led product on our website by a number of rigorous criteria detailed in our 1000bulbs.com led vendor questions. we judge each product by its technical claims and most importantly, by its real-world practicality. for that reason, 1000bulbs.com has the best led lighting selection the internet has to offer, and it is a selection that grows every day. if you are thinking about buying led products from 1000bulbs.com or any other source, we encourage you to consider asking our 1000bulbs.com led customer questions. we also encourage you to consult leds: the promise & performance which explains these issues in more detail. email specials & promos sign up for deals & promotions. 1000bulbs.com is proud to offer our customers products that have earned the government's energy star label. quick links home page my account clearance coupons diy projects all categories shop by brand customer service contact us returns shipping warranty privacy policy faq company about us press releases testimonials employment designer tradesales dallas signrepair charities follow us blog.1000bulbs.com reviews © 2012 1000bulbs.com 2140 merritt dr., garland, tx 75041 | all rights reserved. use of this site signifies your acceptance of 1000bulbs.com terms and conditions and privacy policy homer // v1.65.1-85-g0601708
