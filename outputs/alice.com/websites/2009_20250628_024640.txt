" teresa, tulsa, ok "thank you, thank you, for an enjoyable transaction. my husband and i are so impressed with the way everything was handled, and the arrival of my order that came clear across the country is something your company can give yourself a huge hi-5 for because the packaging itself was fantastic! again, thanks andi definitely will be a returning customer." mollie, lakeview, or "i came across your website on my lunch break while surfing the internet earlier this week. i thought it looked promising so i decided to place an order for the items i had on my shopping list already. i placed this order wednesday, and have confirmed its’ delivery already this morning. the few items i would have had to stop and get at wal-mart this evening are already at my home waiting for me. your company just saved me an hour this evening by not having to stop to pick these up. i’m going to tell all my co-workers about your company to see who else would like to be able to save an hour or two each week." jennifer, north salem, in "just wanted to let you all know that my first order arrived yesterday and everything is marvelous!!! and i love the blue and black boxes. i live 30 miles from the nearest commercial center, and am on oxygen 24/7/365, so shopping trips can be rather difficult for me. alice is extremely convenient for delivery of necessary products.thanks a bunch!!!!! " georgia, yucca, az "dear alice, thanks so much for your service. i had a baby 2 months ago, and it's really difficult to get to target or any store to stock up on household items and baby supplies. the order reminders are great for my sleep-deprived brain, too. alice has truly made my life so much easier and reduced my stress. love your service! the free shipping is what clinched the deal for me. " lisa, los angeles, ca "i just received my first alice order and am soooo happy. i didn't have to wander around some store, search and hopefully find all my items and then stand in line to check out. earlier i called customer service to gush my thanks by phone. but, no, that just isn't enough. i must e-mail you to gush some more. enough gushing! thanks so much. " kathleen, huntley, il "i placed my order not expecting much. your prices were good on most items, lower on a few, and high on only one or two. however, when i received your package (and the free shipping was a huge deciding factor) and opened it, i was more than pleasantly surprised to find my package packaged better than anything i have ever received. i don't know how you guys did that, but everything was balanced, not crushed, items that could have leaked were bagged per room just about, and it was all so neat. i don't want to call the insides of my recycled box cute, but it was. i will continue to order form you guys based on the appearance of my package the free shipping and the prices you offer. " eileen, marietta, ga "after receiving my first order from alice, i took the order sheet to my local grocery store to compare prices. there were some articles i saved on and some i didn't save on, but overall, the prices on alice beat the grocery store prices by several dollars. plus, i didn't have to load the items in my car, out of the car and into the house. my alice box was delivered to my doorstop and all i had to do was open the box and unload! thanks, alice. i am now a regular customer." janelle "i love this site! i have my orders fast and there are tons of deals!" antoinette garry, milwaukee, wi "this website is better than sliced bread. we live in the country and are always running out of toilet paper and kleenex before it's time to go back to the store so this website was a real blessing! i am also a caregiver for my husband who has had a stroke and leg amputation so this gives me peace of mind knowing i don't have to leave him alone while i pick up these items. thanks so much for being there to help." dianne, burlington, north caroline support@alice.com about alice about us contact us jobs press releases news faqs social/blogs alice community blog alice company blog digital cpg follow us on twitter facebook fan page partner links supplier account center wonderland - beta more information list products on alice partner with alice terms of use privacy policy © 2009, alice.com, inc. want to improve the reminder for this product? my current reminder my actual usage alice recommends every 2 weeks every 3 weeks every 4 weeks every 5 weeks every 6 weeks every 2 months every 3 months every 4 months every 5 months every 6 months i don't know
