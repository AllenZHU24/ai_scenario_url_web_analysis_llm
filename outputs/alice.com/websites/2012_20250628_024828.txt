alice carries all of the goods that keep your house running -- items like garbage bags, laundry detergent, dish soap, shaving cream, diapers, and cough syrup, to name a few. you'll find thousands of household essential products on alice, from the big name manufacturers you trust, to the up and coming brands that can't afford space on the traditional store shelf. is alice different than other online retailers? alice.com isn't an ordinary retailer. you order from alice just like you would a retailer, but behind the scenes we work like a marketplace, allowing manufacturers to sell directly to you without the added costs of a retailer. eliminating this extra layer between the people that make the goods and the people that buy them (that's you!) creates a lot of extra savings that can be passed along to you in the form of lower prices. how do i get started?

alice is working hard to revolutionize the traditional coupon. we automatically apply coupons that are available on the goods you buy, and we let our manufacturer partners provide you with special coupons that are personalized for your needs. at alice, you'll get all the benefits of coupons without ever having to pick up a pair a scissors. to view the full details on any coupon available at alice (including expiration date, how many coupons are left, and how many times you can use the coupon) simply click on the coupon symbol in our search results or select the coupon details link from any product page. will alice really ship my order with free shipping?
