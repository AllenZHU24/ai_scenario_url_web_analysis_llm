alice carries all of the goods that keep your house running -- items like garbage bags, laundry detergent, dish soap, shaving cream, diapers, and cough syrup, to name a few. you'll find thousands of household essential products on alice, from the big name manufacturers you trust, to the up and coming brands that can't afford space on the traditional store shelf. is alice different than other online retailers? alice.com isn't an ordinary retailer. you order from alice just like you would a retailer, but behind the scenes we work like a marketplace, allowing manufacturers to sell directly to you without the added costs of a retailer. eliminating this extra layer between the people that make the goods and the people that buy them (that's you!) creates a lot of extra savings that can be passed along to you in the form of lower prices. how do i get started? to get alice started, you need to complete our easy sign up process. it only takes a minute or two to set up your free account. once you set up your account, you can search for products, compare prices, and order your first shipment to make sure you never run out of toilet paper again. is there a membership or other fee to use alice? your account with alice is completely free and you can cancel anytime. does alice work outside the u.s.? not yet. alice currently only works for customers with a u.s. mailing address (no po boxes or apo addresses) in the lower 48 states (d.c. included). if you live in alaska, hawaii, or another country, we hope to be able to serve you in the future. can i use coupons at alice? alice is working hard to revolutionize the traditional coupon. we automatically apply coupons that are available on the goods you buy, and we let our manufacturer partners provide you with special coupons that are personalized for your needs. at alice, you'll get all the benefits of coupons without ever having to pick up a pair a scissors. to view the full details on any coupon available at alice (including expiration date, how many coupons are left, and how many times you can use the coupon) simply click on the coupon symbol in our search results or select the coupon details link from any product page. does free shipping come with a catch? we never charge for shipping on your orders at alice. regardless of the dollar value of your order, you'll receive free shipping. we do have a small minimum order requirement of six items. with 1000's of products to choose from and no minimum dollar amount on your order, it is easy to find at least six items you need around the house, and it sure beats driving to the store. how do i edit or cancel my order? we process orders as quickly as possible to ensure timely delivery. however, you do have 30 minutes from the time you checkout to cancel your order. you can do this from your order history page by clicking "cancel" under the order status. when you cancel an order, the products in that order will return to your shopping cart for your next order. how soon will i receive my order?

alice.com is a marketplace that enables you to buy direct from multiple manufacturers without a retail middleman. because of this direct relationship, we need to collect and remit sales tax in all jurisdictions. the sales tax will be calculated based on your ship-to zip code and therefore, you won't see it in your order summary until you enter your shipping location. you will see the final sales tax amount before confirming your order on step 3 of checkout. how do i purchase an alice gift card?
