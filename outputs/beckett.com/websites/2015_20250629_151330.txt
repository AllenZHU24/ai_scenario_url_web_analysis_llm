posted on november 25, 2015 – 11:28 am | author: david lee football | alabama, baylor, college football, derrick henry, ezekiel elliott, leaf | comments (1) it’s never too early to start talking about next year’s rookie class. with the college football regular season winding down and the playoff picture becoming more clear every week, we thought we’d take a look at several college stars who already have cards on the market. here are seven players who are projected to enter the 2016 nfl draft who you can add to your collection now. by david lee editor | beckett football ezekiel elliott, rb, ohio state the rumbler from ohio state captured everyone’s attention last year in the national championship when he dominated with 246 yards and four touchdowns. elliott finished 2014, his sophomore season, with 1,878 yards and 18 touchdowns. in 2015, he has also been impressive with over 1,500 yards and 17 touchdowns near the end of the season. he’s the consensus top running back prospect for the 2016 nfl draft. elliot was included in the 2013 leaf army all-american bowl set and has a jersey autographs bronze #jaee1 that’s currently listing for $50. he has several other cards in the product. his 2015 sports illustrated for kids #398 can be found for just a few dollars. derrick henry, rb, alabama in the mold of former alabama back eddie lacy, derek henry is a big bruiser who can also break big plays. at 6-3, 240 pounds, few defenses have been able to contain him for an entire game. he has had success against some of the sec’s toughest defenses. last season he rushed for 990 yards while sharing carries with t.j. yeldon. this season he was at 1,526 yards and a national-best 21 touchdowns after 11 games. he should be a first-round pick in the draft. henry had one of the most prolific high school careers ever, breaking a 51-year-old career high school rushing record. he finished with more than 12,000 yards in high school. he was included in 2013 leaf army all-american bowl and the 2013 leaf metal draft army all-american bowl. he has autographs that can be found for about $50-$80 right now. corey coleman, wr, baylor the heisman candidate in the nation’s top scoring offense is projected to be one of the top receivers drafted. corey coleman has a big frame and has shown the ability to wrestle the ball away from defenders, which will be a huge benefit in the nfl. he was leading the nation with 20 touchdowns after 10 games this season, and had totaled nearly 3,000 career yards. baylor looked on track to possibly make the top four in the college football playoff but a loss to oklahoma likely derails that. still, coleman could definitely be one of the hottest 2016 rookies to collect if he does declare for the draft. you can find his first card in 2012 upper deck usa football, including an autograph for less than $20. read more » 2016 topps series 2 baseball includes tributes to ken griffey jr, ichiro 11.24 0 posted on november 24, 2015 – 7:02 pm |
