for the great offer that allowed me to save so much on the titanium membership and i look forward to another great year with beckett! thomas howlandthanks for price guidebeckett price guide has helped me organize and price my cards so i can put my collection in order after letting them set for so long. even cards i purchase new or old, the price list helps me by having a easy to follow listing and a number of photos added to the listings to help me out. thank you gregory thomasawesome!glad to see beckett opg finally in an app! good all around but wish there were more filters. jerry greenmy collectionforget all the different programs on card collecting that make you update all the time; even then you hope they are correct. beckett is foolproof. i never have to worry about updating or trying to hunt down values, beckett does it all. easy, fast and accurate. eddie worthingtonbaseball pricingoverall, i enjoy the lookup and working of the baseball price guides. would love to see a section of "hot cards" that aren't super high end auto's and mem cards. enjoy the organize experience, wish it was easier to add photos to the database. overall a good product that can always get better jason rozonbest ever!the total access on line is the best way to quickly find out the worth of anything i get in collections. i buy lots of collections for only vintage baseball, so finding the value of other sports items is vital to allow me to sell and recoup my hobby dollars to by more collections. barney g barney greenwayperfectit's a perfect website. i can search all my cards find the prices of them. even add them too my online collection. it's so simple too send your cards too get graded also and that process is always fast. the employees are nice and very helpful dallas escamillagreat for ballpark figures!great for giving you an idea of new and old, and somewhat obscure items. find it very valuable and would definetely recommend it to others. great for getting started to work towards figuring what's going on. larry arbourbasketball online price guidefast, faultless, easy to use/understand price guide, can't ask for better than that. stuart grahamfirst timer with total accessa wonderful resource for the serious trader/collector or the part time hobbyist. glenn bissvery goodi only collect ray bourque hockey cards and it's perfect for my needs. i used it for visit to the local card store and my ebay purchases. just what the doctor ordered.... thanks. gord coburnbeckett price guide impressionsafter using the online version of the price guide, i have to say it's nice , however it took a little trying to understand how it worked, at least in my case. it works well, i still prefer the "hard" copy . possibly because it is what i have always used and i am accustomed to it. jon lawrencebest nine dollars spent in some time!beckett online price guide surely paid for itself within the first week. now i know exactly what a card is worth. i would recommend it to anyone who collects trading cards. don mullinixusefulness of the beckett online price guide and organizeas a football card collector, features in the beckett opg site are useful to track prices and to keep my personal collection in order. throughout the years of being a paying member there have been some issues with the site but in the past few months there have been some noticeable improvements. candido manzanofootball cardsi have been collecting cards since 1976. i use to pick up the beckett magazine periodically from different card stores. i am so glad you are an online service now. i also like the ability to subscribe for one month at a time. it is a price i think is very reasonable. ted tongsongreat experiencebeckett offers a total overview of my collection and an estimated value. it's very easy to use the tools to search the database, but i would like more thumbnails on the cards. mark nielsengreat site!im very satisfy with beckett online. nothing negative to say about you website! david boucherwell worth it, so much more than a price guide.i was skeptical at first because i felt the price point was a little high, also the pricing data is not as accurate as it used to be. once i got into the system i feel like the organize feature alone is worth the price. i was able to track down pc cards i didn't know existed. ryan benfordimagesits good so far. i'd like maybe an easier trading process, marketplace is great and opg is always helpful. only thing the opg could use i think is more images. daniel ramoshighly recommend for looking up card value!i have found beckett price guide a valuable tool is rating my cards. judith martincomprehnsive way to keep track of and value collectioni started in 2009 to account for my collection, i was distracted and stopped until recently but held on to a partial subscription. starting where i left off i have a daunting task but have confidence in an honest evaluation with becket!!! francis murdockbaseball cardsonly two words "way cool". greg mcallisterfootball online price guideoverall the football online price guide is good and considerably faster then a year ago. suggest having a search field that allows recommendations instead of typing products/names and coming up with nothing if you do not spell them correctly or use the wrong brand. bryan atkinsbeckett online- a useful tool that educates and motivates memanaging my hobby of card collecting became too cumbersome for me. i was resigned to storing them in the back of my house. it lost it's luster. buying into beckett's online helps me easily price out cards and organize my collections. no more paging through old books, i quickly have today's values! james simpsonnon existent vintage tennis pricingbeckett's tennis guide is useful if you want to know the price of the 2-300 varieties if 2008 ace tennis cards or anything newer than 1991. john olsonthis is great for speedy pricing of cards.i have been pricing sports cards for several days now for a new store inventory. the total access is easy to use and very fast once you get in a groove. highly recommend if you have volume to research. thomas whyteproduct reviewi have only been using your product for one week. so far, i really like the site, features. ken wheatonline price checkingthe system is ok, could be improve, improve the user friendly, sometimes hard to find certain cards - requires the need to put the precise description of what brand and year. also not all cards have graded prices. but overall very effective and reliable pricing tool. william jenkins jrhockey opgdipping my toe back in after all the problems beckett online had over the last few years. i am very happily surprised. the website seems much faster with little load time on opg. i will for sure in the near future go back to subscribing to the total opg and if all goes well will buy yearly opg. larry hurley recent price changes: × beckett homepage
