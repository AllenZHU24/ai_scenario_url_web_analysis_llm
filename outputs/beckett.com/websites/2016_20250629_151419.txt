company itself – has grown in significant proportions, similar to the very field it covers. under the guidance of dr. beckett, the company mastered the print medium, expanded price guide titles to other sports and other genres, introduced web commerce as a viable means of trade and instituted grading as an important segment of the company portfolio. now, on the 30th anniversary of that first magazine launch, beckett media stands poised to continue the foundation first laid down by dr. beckett – one of integrity, commitment and accuracy. in doing so, beckett media will proudly move the
