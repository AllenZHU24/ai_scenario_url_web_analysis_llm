dailylook mini structured handbag reviewed by: luvenia m. | lawrenceville, ga recommends this item absolutely love this bag! i've had my eye on it for quite some time and when i saw that daily look had it back in stock, i immediately ordered the black one! great quality for the price. looks amazing and is great for everyday use. its a small bag that holds just enough. its not too small nor too big. i definitely recommend this purchase. basic thigh high socks reviewed by: hanna a. | minneapolis, mn recommends this item i tried these socks on immediately after they arrived! i am consistently disappointed by socks that claim to be thigh-high but can barely make it over my shins, let alone my knees. these are quite the opposite. extremely comfortable, very squishy, and definitely stretchy enough to make it over my muscular thighs, i have to give these socks a high rating! i'm 5'7, and they make it just to my mid thigh. james deen knit sweater reviewed by: oriella e. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item very accurate! bb dakota denny aztec sweater reviewed by: oriella e. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item really nice!! dailylook crescent moon necklace reviewed by: lisa k. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item cute necklace. my little sister loves it! luann suede convertible satchel reviewed by: lisa k. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item this bag is gorgeous! i wish it was just an inch or two bigger in width to allow for my 2012 macbook pro to slide in and stay put. it does fit notebooks and textbooks though. i was slightly disappointed because the little clasp was loose and one of my straps were falling off. i fixed it though with a pair of pliers and tightened all the other clasps. i feel like the straps are placed on the bag in a way that they're too wide for my shoulders, and i am average shoulder width. and the straps are slightly long too even when cinched all the way down. other than the straps, the material is of great quality and i know i will use this bag often. the straps are just slightly annoying. worth the pay i would say! dailylook classic vegan leather saddlebag purse reviewed by: lisa k. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item this bag is bigger than i expected it to be, but it's actually a perfect size! i could take what i would take in a backpack in this purse. extra secure because of the zipper and the strong magnet. cute design. the strap is perfect when extended just enough. knit knee high socks reviewed by: lisa k. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item these socks are a steal for the price. the soft, knit material is so nice to put on after shaving your legs. i have slightly bigger, muscular legs but these make my legs look feminine. i love how the ribbed top stays put on my thigh too. perfect sizing with the right amount of elasticity, my account login/create order status customer care help & contact us returns & exchanges track order shipping info company about us careers press affiliate program product reviews blog get the newest looks by email find us on ipad iphone © 2006-2015 dailylook. all rights reserved. for assistance call 888-888-6645 about us contact us privacy policy terms of use elite terms of use site map
