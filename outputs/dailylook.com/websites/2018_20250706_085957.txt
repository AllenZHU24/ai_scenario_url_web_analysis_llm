"i've subscribed to several of daily elite's competitors, and this is by far the best styling i've gotten from any of the other companies. i really felt like my stylist read my original feedback, and i thought it struck a really great balance of new/interesting things that still fit within my style." - meredith n.

"my stylist said in her note how she looked through my blog and instagram and saw one of my recent posts about off the shoulder tops. i loved the personalization, which i really didn't expect." - esther c.
