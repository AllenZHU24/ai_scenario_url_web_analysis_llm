"thank you so much for sending my box. i was extremely hesitant after my experience with stitch fix and felt like my style wasn't being captured. i'm so glad i was proven wrong. these styles are me but better; you picked items i would never have been savvy or brave enough to pick on my own." - lauren m. "i've subscribed to several of daily elite's competitors, and this is by far the best styling i've gotten from any of the other companies. i really felt like my stylist read my original feedback, and i thought it struck a really great balance of new/interesting things that still fit within my style." - meredith n. "i am so impressed with the selection of items you included! i'm thrilled to be a part of this service. so glad to have gotten such a great selection of items, and not having to leave the house for it or deal with the mall is fantastic!" - lorrie g. "my stylist said in her note how she looked through my blog and instagram and saw one of my recent posts about off the shoulder tops. i loved the personalization, which i really didn't expect." - esther c. "thank you for making my dl elite box experience amazing! i am definitely satisfied with my boxes. it's evident that you took the time to read my style preferences and picked out the clothes that i would like. i will definitely use this service again and hope to get more awesome additions to my wardrobe." - angel z. are you ready to get styled? get started now or shop new looks © 2006-2017 dailylook. all rights reserved. for assistance call 888-888-6645 about us contact us privacy policy terms of use elite terms of use site map clothing
