hot sale item bag 0 you currently have no items in your bag about dailylook about careers press reviews affiliates product reviews latest customer reviews james deen knit sweater reviewed by: alysia c. | san jose, ca recommends this item rich color. i got the burgundy in small and it sits like a boat neck around the neck. kinda hangs off my shoulders. slouchy oversized fit and im usually a size 6. very cute. jesslyn blake leather bucket bag reviewed by: judy r. | kalamazoo, mi recommends this item i waited for this purse to be re stocked. it was worth it. i love it! easy to carry, not too dressy, for everyday, but very beautiful. soft leather and classy. i am in like with this purse! i use it all the time with jeans or a little dressier. goes with everything! dailylook cuffed boyfriend blazer reviewed by: victoria p. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item i ordered the blazer in navy and i really love it. the cut is really nice and flattering. some things to note: the jacket is unlined and pretty thin. it won't keep you warm. it doesn't look as thin as it is though. there is a single button on either side that serve no practical purpose. the blazer does not button. i think these run large so order a size down. loly in the sky estelle sneakers reviewed by: stephanie c. | pleasantville, somewhere recommends this item i ordered mine last week and received them on sunday. i purchased a size 7 1/2 (my usual size). the color is slightly darker than the picture, but i guess that has to do with the lighting. when i first wore them, they were a little snug from the top area of my foot, but luckily i noticed that the sole can be removed and it allowed more room for my foot. i definitely recommend these sneakers! they are great quality, true to size, comfortable, and super cute!!!! chinese laundry out of sight platform sandal reviewed by: mandy l. | n miami beach, fl recommends this item love these shoes! the review i read from chelsea p. since they were a final sale item i wasn't sure if i should take the chance, but that review really helped. i was able to make a quick decision on if i should by them or not. she was right cause i struggle with heels, but these are perfect. chinese laundry time flies sandals reviewed by: mandy l. | n miami beach, fl recommends this item i love these! thank goodness they worked out cause i bought them when they were on final sale. fyi, if u own shoes from chinese laundry just order them the same size you ordered before. at least that's what i did and it worked for me on both of the chinese laundry shoes that i ordered on final sale. so good luck! circus by sam edelman camilla platforms reviewed by: mandy l. | n miami beach, fl recommends this item these shoes run small, so i would definitely recommend going a 1/2 size up than u normally would wear. also they run a bit to narrow. i own several pair of sam edelman shoes and they fit great. but these just seem to run really narrow then they should. so unfortunately these shoes had to go back. it's to bad cause they would have been great, if they weren't to tight. circus by sam edelman holt booties reviewed by: ernestine r. | san antonio, tx recommends this item the fit is true to size. worn to art museum first wear. slight tightness at big toe. but, love and will continue to break in. soft and comfortable. stripe kimono sleeve dress reviewed by: ernestine r. | san antonio, tx recommends this item ordered this in small. i am 5'1" 106 lbs fit is great, looks fabulous on. peggy vegan leather crossbody reviewed by: ana l. | brooklyn, ny recommends this item this is the cutest bag ever! perfect for going out or on a quick run. the details are gorgeous and i always get compliments when i wear it! totally love it! my account login/create order status customer care help & contact us returns & exchanges track order shipping info international stylist chat offline company about us careers press affiliate program product reviews blog get the newest looks by email sign up find us on iphone © 2006-2014 dailylook. all rights reserved. for assistance call 888-888-6645 contact us privacy policy terms of use site map
