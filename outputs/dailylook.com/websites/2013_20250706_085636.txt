the only drawback is that i am a size small, however even with my thin frame i do have some curves, the dress tended to slide up while i was walking. all in all, i love the dress and wouldn't trade it for the world!!!!!! mini on the go structured handbag reviewed by: anstovall1 | northport, al recommends this item i adore this bag! it is the perfect handle or crossbody bag. front pocket is great for chapstick or rewards cards. inside is quite roomy w/a back zipper pocket & 2 slip pockets great for keeping a girl organized! i get compliments on this bag everywhere i go! :) i think i am now going to purchase another color! line & dot flowy trench coat reviewed by: jenny y. | calgary, ab recommends this item when i ordered this item i expected it to be more on the "coat' side but it is actually quite thin, however to be frank, i love it. it is flowy and stylish with a uniqueness to it. i am 5'3" 100lbs and the xs fits perfect! ps. thanks, jen frmheadtotoe. reptile buckle bracelet reviewed by: nittaya k. | woodbridge, va recommends this item i got this as a birthday gift for my cousin and she loved it! she loves it as much as the michael kors one. =) great quality! high waist faux leather leggings reviewed by: caitlinkearney | greenbrae, ca recommends this item really cute on the body and looks great with so many styles. many ladies asked me where i got these too! this is true to size. like really true to size. i am 5'6, size 4/6 and got the m and thank goodness i did because i have a booty and these are not spandex stretchy. the high waist is also a must so there are no lines. the seam on the lower waist didn't hit me in the right spot, but the high waist saved that. jersey knit maxi skirt reviewed by: sinead d. | van nuys, ca recommends this item super soft and comfortable, i want to wear it everyday! i'm also short, so length is almost always an issue, but it was easy to adjust the length of the skirt by folding over the top and it looked great. it also fits well around my hips and is very flattering. i love it! tribal cocoon cardigan reviewed by: stefaniempowers | new york, ny recommends this item i adore this cardigan. it's long and cozy. the pattern is beautiful. it goes with everything. tribal lined combat boots reviewed by: kelsey b. | ottawa, on recommends this item i absolutely love these boots! i got a size 8 and they were a bit big but with thick socks they fit very well. they're super comfortable and they look exactly as the picture large structured handbag reviewed by: jillian c. | nutley, nj recommends this item i was looking for an inexpensive, celine-inspired tote, and i definitely got it in the large structured handbag. the exterior looks great -- it's a pretty decent quality faux leather that actually feels soft and lush like leather. i have it in both black and royal blue and the colors are definitely vibrant and eye catching. the handle's drop is just a hair too short to comfortably wear on my shoulder for long periods of time but the detachable strap makes up for it. it's a large bag and it holds *a lot*, which i love. so far, the stitching has held up to carrying quite a heavy load for a few weeks straight. my only issue with this bag is the lining. the material (faux suade?) looks and feels cheap and is starting to separate from the bag. had the manufacturer used a higher-quality lining, this bag would actually be perfect at this price point. overall, i'm happy with the bag, i get a lot of compliments, and it definitely has the celine-vibe i was going for. leatherette panel leggings reviewed by: jpheez | fremont, ca recommends this item i get a lot of compliments from girls and guys whenever i wear these. they really do look great and go with so many of my outfits. like the last reviewer said, however, they are pretty thin - definitely not the warmest leggings i've owned. slightly over priced, but i love how they look!
