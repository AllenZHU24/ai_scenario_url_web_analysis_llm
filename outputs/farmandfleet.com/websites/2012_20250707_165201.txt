ties to family and community. today, it is in this spirit that we support charitable organizations dedicated to family, community and agricultural education. bert & claude blain memorial scholarships agricultural education is much more sophisticated today than when bert & claude blain opened their first blain's farm & fleet store in 1955. today, students must include topics such as environmental science, biotechnology and global marketing into their studies. in honor of our founders, blain supply works with the ffa each year to establish four educational scholarships for students pursuing a 4-year degree in agriculture. since its inception in 1997, the ffa has awarded the bert and claude blain memorial scholarship to 24 hard working students. for more information about the bert & claude blain memorial scholarships, please contact the ffa at 317.802.6060. kids helping kids kids helping kids is a program created by blain's farm & fleet, which teaches our children the importance and beauty of giving to others in need. in 2000, the very first annual kids helping kids program was launched in conjunction with the opening of blain's farm & fleet toyland. through this program, parents register their children to win gift cards. then, on behalf of the winning children, blain's farm & fleet donates a matching dollar amount to a variety of charities in each of our communities. the winners of the contest are encouraged to help present the matching contribution to the charitable organizations. some of the charities that have received these gifts are boys & girls clubs, cops for kids, dove, inc, empty stocking club, family resource center, good fellow fund, head start and more! 4-h sponsorships blain supply, inc. is a proud sponsor of numerous 4-h activities. each year, blain supply provides approximately 350 trophies and 180 ribbons/rosettes to 4-h clubs throughout our communities. the mission of the 4-h is to empower youth to reach their full potential, working and learning in partnership with caring adults. blain supply is honored to be a part of this worthwhile organization. additional community programs whether it is supporting the local boys & girls clubs, sponsoring an adopt-a-pet program or donating to another worthwhile organization, each blain's farm & fleet store is actively involved in contributing to charitable programs in our communities. store
