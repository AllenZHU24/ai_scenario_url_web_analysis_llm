(that explains the original monthly comic strip on our web site and the straight talk you'll find in our product descriptions and ebay auction listings.) we now sell in a variety of different channels including our web-site and amazon.com.  in addition, our enthusiasm for ebay has certainly grown considerably over the years.  we are the largest golf equipment seller on ebay with item postings in the thousands daily, and we have maintained a 99.9% positive feedback rating with over 200,000 unique transactions (we still can't figure out why that one guy was so cranky).  in 2007, 3balls was inducted into the ebay hall of fame for our commitment to excellence and service to the ebay community…an accomplishment we are all very proud of and humbled by. specializing in used and like new branded golf equipment, 3balls is also responsible for pioneering industry efforts to make the secondary market in golf more efficient. in so doing, 3balls developed and created the pga.com value guide in collaboration with both pga.com and ebay® . in general, reliable golf club industry value standards are needed to make the entire infrastructure of buying, selling and trading of used golf clubs more efficient and fair for both retailers and consumers. the pga.com value guide, which is the blue book of golf™, fills this need by being the national standard for golf club values™. to learn more, please click here. 3balls.com is headquartered in west bridgewater, ma in a mixed-use facility. our staff of more than 50 handles all order processing, fulfillment, inventory processing, warehousing, customer service, business development, and management at these 2 locations (see cast of characters).  in both 2007 and 2008, we were awarded inc. magazine’s award for fastest growing privately held companies in america…not too bad for a bunch of golf nuts in a sleepy suburb in eastern massachusetts. ok, so what about the name? well if you look carefully at the joe & leigh's swap shop sign near the top of the page, you'll see in the corner there are 3 glass globes hanging behind the vintage golfer. those 3 balls (get it?) are the universal symbol of traditional pawn shops and the inspiration for 3balls.com. that's the inside story! if you want to see some inside pictures, take a peek at this illustration of the 3balls logo design process. about 3balls what is a 3balls? cast of characters 3balls dot comic strip 3balls ebay store helpful links help sitemap contact us condition grading shopping cart customer service help desk shipping rates & info shopping cart track recent order return info payment info gift certificates privacy policy contact us affiliate program jobs at 3balls back to homepage shop equipment drivers fairway woods hybrids iron sets single irons complete sets wedges putters women's equipment junior equipment lefty equipment shop accessories apparel bags balls gloves golf gifts gps/rangefinders headcovers headwear practice aids shoes team gear shop top brands adams callaway cleveland cobra footjoy mizuno nike odyssey ping taylormade titleist * 3balls dollar ($) and percentage (%) off promotions: due to manufacturer restrictions, all new (not including closeouts) items (including logo overruns) from adams, adidas, ben hogan, callaway, cleveland, club glove, cobra, footjoy, mizuno, never compromise, nike, odyssey, ping, sun mountain, taylormade, titleist and some others are excluded.
