qty: add to cart description little dogs rejoice! we’ve catered elite little dog in-ground fence for your petite pal’s safety. it starts with petsafe's smallest waterproof receiver collar, specially designed for greater comfort. the reflective strip on the collar helps you find your small dog at night, so outside playtime doesn’t have to end when the sun goes down! to set up the system, you’ll establish the yard boundaries with underground wiring. training your best furry friend to stay within those boundaries is a snap. no more straying. no more worrying. just big freedom for those little paws. little dogs love to play in the yard just as much as big dogs, and now they can! here’s how it works. the collar picks up a signal from a transmitter as your dog nears the boundary wires you bury in your yard. a beep alerts your dog and most dogs do so well with training that they stop right then! for those that continue, a harmless static correction reminds them to stay in the area you’ve established. formerly called the deluxe little dog in-ground fence, this system is packed with petsafe's most advanced features. a low-battery indicator light, surge protection for the transmitter, wiring for up to 1/3 acre (can be expanded), and multiple correction levels – it all adds up to a huge value for your little friend and you. system includes: transmitter with power adapter, receiver collar with rfa-188 battery, test light tool, operating and training guide, 50 boundary training flags, 500 feet of wire, wire nuts, g gel-filled capsules, and mounting bracket.features: for dogs 5 pounds and up waterproof receiver collar fits neck sizes 6-16 inches 4 adjustable levels of static correction tone-only mode alerts your pet with a beep covers up to 1/3 acre with included boundary wire and expandable up to 25 acres with additional wire (not included) you may also be interested in the following product(s) acana heritage feast formula grain free dry dog food $20.99 select options acana heritage free run poultry formula grain free dry dog food $16.99 select options acana heritage freshwater fish formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana heritage light & fit formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana heritage meats formula grain free dry dog food $19.99 select options acana heritage paleo formula grain free dry dog food $20.99 select options acana heritage puppy & junior formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana regionals appalachian ranch cat and kitten grain free dry cat food $23.99 select options telephone (941) 921-7546 orders@gulfcoastpetsupplies.com 4532 mcashton st, sarasota, fl 34233 store hours: 7 am - 3 pm et (monday - friday). customer phone support: 9 am - 2:30 pm et. closed all major holidays. acana jw pet adaptil kidco against the grain kittywalk akoma pet products k9 natural alzoo koha angels' eyes lotus pet food antler chewz kong applaws litter kwitter ark naturals midwest homes for pets arlee pet loving pets arm & hammer merrick aussie naturals natural chemistry avoderm multipet toys bags on board natural balance barkworthies nature's recipe bayer nature's logic bellrock growers - pet greens nature's own benebone neater pet brands bergan pet products nature's variety bixbi naturvet blue buffalo nulo blue ridge naturals newman's own organic bocce's bakery north states gates booster bath nutri-vet bravo nupro butchers block nutramax canine caviar nylabone california natural nutrisource canidae nutro castor & pollux our pets cat man doo old mother hubbard caru orijen chuckit!
