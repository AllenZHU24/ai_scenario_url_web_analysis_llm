qty: add to cart description "persistent pooch? hard-headed or hard of hearing? now you can still keep them playing safely in the yard and nowhere else. with 4 higher-intensity settings than petsafe's other collars, even dogs that are difficult to train respond well to the stubborn dog in-ground fence system. the safe, gentle static correction works so effectively that most dogs learn to stop in their tracks at the warning beep that precedes the correction. the vibration option is ideal for hearing-impaired dogs, or as an alternative to static correction. some dogs were born to test limits. but the stubborn dog in-ground fence system sets firm boundaries that you’ll quickly train them to understand. here’s how it works. you’ll set the boundary by burying wires around the perimeter of your yard. your dog wears a collar that picks up the signal from the transmitter. as your dog nears the boundary wires, a beep alerts your dog, giving them a chance to stop without any correction. for those that continue, a safe static correction reminds them to stay in the area you’ve established. simply adjust the correction level if your dog continues to test the boundaries. after about 2 weeks of training, even the most stubborn dogs can start enjoying their new yard freedom! and for hearing-impaired or senior dogs who simply can’t detect the beep, there’s a special vibration mode. your furry friends will certainly thank you for the extra help in keeping them safe! system includes: transmitter with power adapter, receiver collar with 9-volt alkaline battery, surge protector, 50 boundary training flags, 500 feet of 18-gauge boundary wire, wire nuts, gel-filled capsules, test light tool, operating and training guide.features: for dogs 8 pounds and up waterproof receiver collar fits neck sizes 6-28 inches 4 adjustable levels of static correction tone-only mode alerts your pet with a beep covers up to 1/3 acre with included boundary wire and is expandable up to 10 acres with additional wire (not included) " you may also be interested in the following product(s) acana heritage feast formula grain free dry dog food $20.99 select options acana heritage free run poultry formula grain free dry dog food $16.99 select options acana heritage freshwater fish formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana heritage light & fit formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana heritage meats formula grain free dry dog food $19.99 select options acana heritage paleo formula grain free dry dog food $20.99 select options acana heritage puppy & junior formula grain free dry dog food $18.99 select options acana regionals appalachian ranch cat and kitten grain free dry cat food $23.99 select options telephone (941) 921-7546 orders@gulfcoastpetsupplies.com 4532 mcashton st, sarasota, fl 34233 store hours: 7 am - 3 pm et (monday - friday). customer phone support: 9 am - 2:30 pm et. closed all major holidays. acana jw pet adaptil kidco against the grain kittywalk akoma pet products k9 natural alzoo koha angels' eyes lotus pet food antler chewz kong applaws litter kwitter ark naturals midwest homes for pets arlee pet loving pets arm & hammer merrick aussie naturals natural chemistry avoderm multipet toys bags on board natural balance barkworthies nature's recipe bayer nature's logic bellrock growers - pet greens nature's own benebone neater pet brands bergan pet products nature's variety bixbi naturvet blue buffalo nulo blue ridge naturals newman's own organic bocce's bakery north states gates booster bath nutri-vet bravo nupro butchers block nutramax canine caviar nylabone california natural nutrisource canidae nutro castor & pollux our pets cat man doo old mother hubbard caru orijen chuckit!
