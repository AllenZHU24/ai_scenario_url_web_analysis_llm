> knife types > gyutosresources gyutosgyuto knives are basically the japanese version of a western chef knives with a few small modifications. first, most gyutos do not have a traditional western bolster that runs down the base of the heel. some also have traditional japanese style handles and are called wa-gyutos. japanese gyutos are often made of thinner, harder steel which many professionals like because the knives can be sharpened to a steeper, sharper edge and the knives don't wedge through food as much because the blade doesn't push through food as much as thicker knives.
