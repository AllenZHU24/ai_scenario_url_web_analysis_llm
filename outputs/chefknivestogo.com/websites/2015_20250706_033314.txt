my name is mark richmond and i am the owner. i started the business in 2002 in madison wi along with my wife and business partner, susan brown.the idea to start the knife business grew out of sue's interest in cooking. we had run a brick and mortar retail store for 10 years and sold it in 2000. at that time, sue decided to attend culinary school at madison area technical college. as she began accumulating knives for school, i developed an interest in them myself and thought it might be a good product to retail online. i told sue i wanted to run the business as a hobby out of a spare room in our house. she didn't object and the business quickly turned into a full-time job. after a year we moved the business out of our house and into an office just a few blocks from our house, not far from the uw-madison campus.so here we are 12+ years later. the business has been successful and we are fortunate to be able to work together.recently i expanded our knife selection to include 70+ different brands. i believe that gives us the widest variety of knives of any online store and perhaps any regular retail store. over time, i have added hard to find, hand-crafted japanese knives from small blacksmiths in japan like takeda, moritaka, and tanaka and this is the primary focus of our website along with sharpening stones. we are both proud of our selection and we are committed to fast shipping and excellent customer service.sue and i moved to madison 26 years ago from massachusetts where we met. i grew up in connecticut and new jersey and graduated from rutgers university with a ba in history and political science. sue grew up in massachusetts and graduated with a ba in english from umass-amherst. sue still loves to cook. we both love to travel and enjoy biking the rural roads of southern wisconsin. cktg is at heart a small business so the service is personal. they are one of the rare companies that actually dispatch the order the same day as receiving it and provide tracking information. it is great to deal with an individual by name and it’s evident that they take pride and love in what they do.had a problem with one of the products and they went out of their way to resolve. i would highly recommend dealing with this company. it’s nice to find a company who cares and they will get me as a return customer.mark is great at answering questions for knife nuts of all levels. his service is second to none. really appreciate the time he puts into every email as well as the free forum he hosts.great experience working with chef knives to go. quick delivery, and they are great about returning emails. i'm actually waiting on my second knife from them. i'm sure there will be more to come.loved the instructional videos on the website.great service and quick shipping. best selection of japanese knives around. i recommend this site to all of my fellow culinary professionals!top quality service. none better.always the best. quick shipping, description matches what is delivered and the price, you can't beat them. i always come here to order anything i might need for the kitchen and i am never disappointed.i ordered several christmas presents from chef knives to go. everything arrived as promised and all who received gifts from there were happy with them.as always, the shopping experience at chef knives to go was excellent. fast, free shipping, great website description of the product, and the confidence instilled in me because i know that if there are any problems the good people at chef knives to go will help me work it out.my go to company for kitchen gear. awesome selection of knives and tools. super fast shipping. never had a problem and questions about all products are answered quickly. great customer service. sign up to receive news, special discounts and more!
