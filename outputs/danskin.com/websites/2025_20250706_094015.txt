situation. iii. what we do to keep this site secure a. security: we employ procedural and technical safeguards to secure your personal information against loss, theft, alteration, and unauthorized access, use and disclosure. any information you enter on our accounts setup page is encrypted before transmission to our server by using 128-bit secure sockets layer encryption software. you can safely enter your credit card and personal registration information and it cannot be read in transit to our server. we also employ many security procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. regardless of the precautions taken by us we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. what you can do to protect your information? (i) use only secure websites when disclosing your information. secure pages begin with "https". (ii) avoid using easy to figure out access and personal id (pin) codes. (iii) never respond to unsolicited requests for your social security number or financial information. (iv) do not disclose your passwords to the site or your account information to any other person. (v) be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. b. hypertext links: our site may contain "links" to other websites, and we cannot and are not responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our site. if you provide any information to parties who operate websites that are linked to or from this site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. we encourage you to review other websites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information. under no circumstances shall we have any liability whatsoever for the activities conducted by or at any website accessed from or through the site. iv. information from persons under the age of 13 notice: visit www.onguardonline.gov for tips from the federal trade commission on protecting kids' privacy online. we do not seek to collect personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. if we become aware that we have inadvertently received such information online from a child under the age of 13, we will delete it from our records. if you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personally identifiable information to us. if you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 13 who has provided personally identifiable information to us, please inform us by contacting us at cs@danskin.com and we will remove such information from our database. if you are concerned about your children's use of the site, you may use web filtering technology to supervise or limit access to the site. v. your california privacy rights (as provided by california civil code section 1798.83) a california resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“california customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. in general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a california customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. however, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a privacy policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this privacy policy. rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. as stated in this privacy policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. if you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. to prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. if you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. you should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. california customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing cs@danskin.com. please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address. vi. general a. limitation of liability: in no event shall we be liable for any incidental, consequential, indirect or special damages, (including lost profits) whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or not we are advised of the possibility of such damages. because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the limitations set forth in this paragraph may not apply to you. if the foregoing limitations are held inapplicable or unenforceable for any reason, then the maximum liability of us to you for any type of damages shall be limited to the greater of the actual amount paid by you for any products offered on the website or u.s. $100.00. b. miscellaneous: the privacy policy for the site established by us constitutes ours and your entire understanding with respect to the use of the site. we control and/or operate the site from offices in the united states of america. we do not represent that materials on the site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. persons who choose to access this site from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. this privacy policy shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. you agree to personal jurisdiction by the federal and state courts located in new york county, new york state. no waiver by use of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the site must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. if any provision of the terms and conditions and privacy policy is found to be unenforceable for any reason, than that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. vii. changes to our terms and conditions and our privacy policy we may revise this privacy policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting. it is your obligation to review the privacy policy from time to time. last updated: september 7, 2021 customer care shipping
