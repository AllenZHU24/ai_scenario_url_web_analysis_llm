shipping rules and tips when ordering from getfpv.com getfpv offers united states postal service (usps) and united parcel service (ups) shipping options. shipping rules no freight forwarding addresses: we do not allow orders to be shipped to freight forwarding addresses. we ship internationally to almost any country in the world. no hotel addresses: we do not allow orders to be shipped to hotels. please provide a permanent street address. po boxes: shipments to po boxes are reviewed on a case by case basis and may be declined. refunds: all orders that are declined by us due to any of these rules are voided with your method of payment and the order is canceled. shipping within the usa we have updated our shipping system to make it easier to get your orders when you need them. we have economy which takes three to six days, express which takes two to three days and next day which delivers within 1-2 days based on when you order. as we are based in sarasota, florida, economy shipping can be a good and economical service option. shipping to countries outside the usa shipping packages to outside the us can get expensive and various shipping options can take a long time. generally, if you choose economy shipping be prepared to wait many days if not weeks for your order to arrive. these packages are often held up in outgoing customs as well as in incoming customs once the package arrives in your destination country. all of the economy shipping methods are generally challenged by the fact that the package is handed from usps to the local postal service of your destination country. this "hand-off" often creates delays and issues with solid tracking information. economy shipping may not provide any tracking for shipments to countries outside of the us. when tracking is available for packages, it often shows only sporadic tracking details. we strongly advise against using economy shipping for international orders as it is the slowest and most unreliable shipping method available. if your order costs more than $40, we would always advise you pick a more reliable shipping method such as ups. generally, almost 100% of the packages we send arrive at their destination country even if a package is severely delayed. we've seen packages 'disappear' in a black shipping hole only to re-emerge weeks later at the customer's destination. where is my shipment? if you want to get an idea of status of your order (like "has my order shipped yet?"), log in to your getfpv account and look at your order history. each order will show if it was shipped and provide a tracking link, if available, given your selected shipping methods. if your order status shows shipped but you do not see tracking that means your order is packaged and will be shipped shortly. if your status is processing it means that we have received your order and will be shipping as soon as possible. how long until my order ships? you should plan for at least 1 business day from the time your order is placed until it is shipped. while we do our best to get all in-stock orders that are placed before 2:30 (est) shipped out on the same day, we cannot always guarantee such a short processing time. make sure you review our terms and conditions with important details relating to shipping. contact us contact information address:1060 goodrich ave, sarasota, fl 34236 phone:+1
