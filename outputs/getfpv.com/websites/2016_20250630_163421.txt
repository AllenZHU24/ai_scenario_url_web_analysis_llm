if you want to get an idea of status of your order (like "has my order shipped yet?"), log in to your getfpv account and look at your order history. each order will show if it was shipped and provide a tracking link, if available, given your selected shipping methods. if your order status shows shipped but you do not see tracking that means your order is packaged and will be shipped shortly. if your status is processing it means that we have received your order and will be shipping as soon as possible. how long until my order ships? you should plan for at least 1 business day from the time your order is placed until it is shipped. while we do our best to get all in-stock orders that are placed before 2:30 (est) shipped out on the same day, we cannot always guarantee such a short processing time. make sure you review our terms and conditions with important details relating to shipping. <[!--{page/switch_store_switcher}--]><[!--/{page/switch_store_switcher}--]> help email us call us +1 (941) 444-0021 our usa location shipping fast, world-wide shipping free shipping for us orders $60+ shipping tips connect newsletter sign-up facebook twitter fpvlab forum links career opportunities dealer catalog terms & conditions return policy contact us © 2016 getfpv. all rights reserved.
