fpv? no idea what the sport entails? these videos will help! the fpv quad there are many parts on an fpv quadcopter! this video will give you an intro: 1. frame the "frame" is the base of the quad. everything is built onto the frame. frames are mostly made from carbon fiber to ensure durability at an ultra-light weight. there are many frames that you can choose from! we recommend the lumenier qav-x charpu fpv racing quadcopter (4mm) as a beginner frame. 2. motors motors are the powerhouse of the quadcopter. it's used to spin the propellers and generate thrust. motor size is important. size is determined by the stator width and height in millimeters. most 5" quads use 22-24mm stator width and 4-7mm stator height. we recommend the lumenier 2206 as a beginner motor. 3. esc's electronic speed controllers (esc's) are used to adjust the speed that the motor spins at. the flight controller sends a signal to the esc which tells it how much power needs to go through to the motors. more power = more thrust. we recommend the lumenier 30a biheli_s as a beginner esc. 4. fc the flight controller (fc) is the brains behind everything! this is where the magic happens. our minds can not compute millions of calculations every second to keep the quadcopter flying. the fc does this for us! we recommend the lumenier lux v2 as a beginner fc. 5. pdb the power distribution board (pdb) is used to send the correct amount of power from the battery to all the different components of the quadcopter. different components need different voltages, so the pbd helps regulate all of this. we recommend the lumenier 4power plus as a beginner pdb. 6. radio rx the radio receiver is used to transmit the signal sent from your radio to the flight controller. there are different radio receivers for different brands of radios. we cant' recommend a specific receiver since it all depends on which radio you are flying. 7. battery the battery is the powerhouse of the quadcopter. without batteries, your quadcopter is a paperweight. it is important to have a good knowledge of batteries since they can be dangerous. make sure you learn about them as much as you can before you start to fly! we recommend the lumenier graphene series batteries for beginners. 8. propellers the propellers are used to turn all that motor power into thrust! there are a myriad of propellers available. some are better designed than others and create more thrust. some are also more durable in crashed. we recommend the lumenier butter cutter as a great, all around propeller. 9 fpv camera the fpv camera is your eye n the sky! if you don't have a good camera, you won't see whats going on. don't save on buying a budget camera, rather get a high end one. this will also make your fpv experience so much better. we recommend the lumenier cm-650 if you want a great fpv camera. 10. video tx the video transmitter (vtx) is used to send the video signal to your goggles. the strength of the signal is determined in milliwatts (mw). the most used vtx has a 200mw output power and at races they usually drop that down to 25mw. we recommend the lumenier 5.8ghz 200mw pro as a beginner vtx. 11. antennas finally, the antenna is whats used to send that video signal from your vtx to the goggles. a well designed antenna will give you a clearer picture and are also more durable in crashes. we recommend the lumenier axii 5.8ghz as a beginner antenna. recommended beginner bundles multi-purpose quad bundle kit micro fpv quad kit los to fpv bundled kit need more info? this is just the start of your journey into fpv! if you've enjoyed what you have learned so far, we recommend you to checkout the rest of the videos in this series on the fpv academy website. by following the build-along guides,
