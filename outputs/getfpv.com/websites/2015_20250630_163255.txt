and fedex shipping options. shipping rules no freight forwarding addresses: we do not allow orders to be shipped to freight forwarding addresses. we ship internationally to almost any country in the world. no hotel addresses: we do not allow orders to be shipped to hotels. please provide a permanent street address. po boxes: shipments to po boxes are reviewed on a case by case basis and may be declined. refunds: all orders that are declined by us due to any of these rules are voided with your method of payment and the order is canceled. shipping within the usa if you live in the us, we think that usps priority mail is a great way to ship. it typically will get your package to you in 2 days at a reasonable cost. this priority mail 2-day delivery turn-around is better than ups ground, for instance, which can take as much as 5 business days. in the us, usps priority mail provides tracking information and is an overall great service. if a ups method (like "ups ground" or "ups 3-day")  is more expensive or even similarly priced to usps priority mail, we recommend choosing priority mail as your package will get to you faster. as we are based in sarasota, florida, usps first class can be a good and economical service option as delivery time should be within 2-3 days. shipping to countries outside the usa shipping packages to outside the us can get expensive and various shipping options can take a long time. generally, if you choose usps first class be prepared to wait many days if not weeks for your order to arrive. these packages are often held up in outgoing customs as well as in incoming customs once the package arrives in your destination country. all of the usps shipping methods are generally challenged by the fact that the package is handed from usps to the local postal service of your destination country. this "hand-off" often creates delays and issues with solid tracking information. usps first class does not provide any tracking for shipments to countries outside of the us. even usps methods for packages leaving the us that should provide tracking details (like priority mail and express) often show only sporadic tracking details. we strongly advise against using usps first class for international orders as it is the slowest and most unreliable shipping method available. if you care about your package and the cost goes above $40 usd, we would always advise you pick a more reliable shipping method such as usps priority mail or ups. we also don't like usps express for international shipments. usps express is supposed to provide you 3-6 day turn around at a premium price, but we've seen packages delayed by weeks using this method as packages get handed from usps to the local postal service. if you are thinking of using usps express, we urge you to consider ups instead. your package will stay in the possession of ups throughout its journey and you will have complete tracking information throughout. ups worldwide saver is our fastest shipping method which provides 2 day delivery to almost any country in the world at only a slight premium over usps express. generally, almost 100% of the packages we send arrive at their destination country even if a package is severely delayed. we've seen packages 'disappear' in a black shipping hole only to re-emerge weeks later at the customer's destination. where is my shipment? if you want to get an idea of status of your order (like "has my order shipped yet?"), log in to your getfpv account and look at your order history. each order will show if it was shipped and provide a tracking link, if available, given your selected shipping methods. how long until my order ships? you should plan for at least 1 business day from the time your order is placed until it is shipped. while we do our best to get orders that are placed before noon (est) shipped out on the same day, we cannot always guarantee such a short processing time. make sure you review our terms and conditions with important details relating to shipping. help email us call us +1 (941) 444-0021 our usa location shipping fast, world-wide shipping free shipping for us orders $60+ shipping tips
