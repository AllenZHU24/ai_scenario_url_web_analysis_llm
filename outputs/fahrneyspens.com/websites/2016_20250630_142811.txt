most fountain pens use ink cartridges or a converter; some have piston-fill systems that use bottled ink only. a pen becomes a very personal possession for most people. the grace and style of the fountain creates a certain aura that is difficult to describe but appeals to many, especially in our fast-paced culture. touch pen to paper and experience the unique pleasure only a fountain pen creates. selecting a fountain pen is much like choosing a pair of glasses. you must take into account your aesthetic and technical needs.the ideal pen is a perfect marriage of form and function; it should fit your handwriting style. if your handwriting is small or condensed, select a fine nib. broad nibs are great for signatures, but can be a little temperamental. nibs must be held flat and not rotated when writing. this will keep the ink flow feeding the point sufficiently.remember that like any fine mechanism, a pen must go through a two to four week breaking-in period. treat a pen properly and it will last a lifetime, paying the dividend of enjoyable writing. the care and feeding of fountain pens we are frequently asked about the proper way to clean and care for a fountain pen. here are a few tips that will ensure the best performance from your fountain pens: always use fresh ink. if your ink is over a year old, buy a new bottle. ink cartridges are fine, but a self-filling pen or the use of a converter with bottle ink will offer fewer problems. if your pen is to be out of use for several weeks, clean it by flushing in cold water. never wash a pen in hot water or alcohol! use cold water only. if the pen is really dirty, use a mixture of one part non-sudsy household ammonia to 2 parts cold water and allow the nib section to soak overnight. flush the nib in cold running water until it runs clear and dry with a soft cloth. if you value a fine pen and it is suited for your hand, do not let someone else use it. you could be asking for trouble. cap the pen properly. hold the pen upright and place the cap on top of it. do not drop the pen into the cap or you may end up with ink in the cap. before you fly in a plane, either fill your pen all the way or leave it empty. a sudden change in cabin pressure may cause the pen to leak if you don't follow this rule. contact us if you have any questions regarding your order or need additional product information/shopping assistance, you can email our customer service department at custserv@fahrneyspens.com. you can also call customer service between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. est, monday through friday, at 1.800.336.4775 or fax us any time at 301.736.2926. if you wish to place your order over the phone, please call us any time at 1.800.624.7367. mail orders can be addressed to: fahrney's pens, 8329 old marlboro pike, suite b13, upper marlboro, md 20772. packing & delivery standard delivery will reach you within approximately 8 business days of our receipt of your order. the time varies according to your distance from our warehouse in suburban washington, d.c. two day and next day delivery are available, which can be selected while checking out online or on the order form, if ordering by mail. please include a comment if you need the product by a certain date. please allow 24 hours for your order to be processed. sales tax will be added to your total for addresses in maryland (5%) and washington, d.c.
