impersonal, discount two-way radio came on the scene as a family-owned company with a passionate enthusiasm to build something different.  together with his father, ben burns started discount two-way radio in a small apartment in 1997, with no customers, no contacts, no money, and no product line. discount two-way radio has achieved considerable success growing the company to serve over 62,000 customers using a direct, straightforward approach that cuts through the hype and smoke that can sometimes surround advancements in technology. together, ben and his father wanted to offer customers a respectful experience; to be the source of quality radio products, the best prices, and technological service that is more like working with friends and family than with a bland corporation's glossy sales pitch. with an honest, almost old-fashioned work ethic that primarily consisted of "pounding the pavement" with a reliable product and personable customer care, together they grew their company from the ground up to where it is today: a thriving corporation that maintains a dynamic full time staff and 60,000 square foot warehouse. discount two-way radio has been listed as one of inc5000's fastest growing companies since 2007. as an rca award-winning distributor known for our superior technical and sales expertise, discount two way radio proudly offers our line of durable and reliable
