the xr150 is the smallest and lightest business radio in its class. we sell thousands of xr150's to small schools, churches, retail stores, restaurants and other small businesses and they all love how compact and durable this radio is. there is no other radio that gives you the durability of a real business radio yet is so small and easy to use. if you are currently using a xtn, cls, rdx series, cp110 or freetalk radio... the xr150 is the radio that you really want. when you upgrade to the xr150 we will program it to talk perfectly with your existing radios at no extra charge. aaa+ rated 2 year warranty and after warranty support this radio puts its money where its mouth is and gives you peace of mind with a class leading 2 year warranty. other radios in this class only offer you a one year warranty. all repair work is performed in-house at our state of the art repair facility by certified engineers. this means that over 95% of rca repairs are completed in less than three business days… unlike our competition who send most repairs back to the factory for depot repair which takes weeks, not days. at the end of the day faster repair turnaround means less hassle for you. even after two years you can still call us for help. if the radio does need to be repaired after the two year warranty has expired it is only $50 flat rate (includes labor, parts and return shipping). most other radios in this class can't even be repaired which forces you to buy a new radio and spend more money than you need to. all day battery life the xr150 has a high capacity lithium ion battery included standard. this will last over 12 hours with normal use so you don't have to worry about your radio dying during an extra long shift. lithium batteries are the lightest type of batteries available so it makes your radio easy to carry and a pleasure to use. lithium batteries do not experience memory effect so there is no special care required. just charge and go. guaranteed compatibility we guarantee that the xr150 will talk with your existing radios. the most common myth is that you have to keep buying the same model of radio in order for them to talk to each other. not true. we can program the xr150 to talk with your existing radios, whether it is a motorola, kenwood, icom or vertex. you can now expand your fleet of radios with a better radio for a better price without blowing your budget on replacing all of your existing radios. fcc 2013 narrowband compliant the xr150 is 100% fcc 2013 narrowband compliant. when you buy new radios it will arrive already programmed to narrowband. if you want it to talk with your existing radios we can change your existing radios to narrowband free of charge when you buy new rca radios. accessories! the xr150 has a huge selection of available accessories. earpieces, speaker mics, headsets, holsters, it has it all. the accessory jack has a screw-in connector which securely locks the accessory in place so it doesn't get yanked out by accident. this also protects the accessory jack from damage. it is also compatible with any motorola 2-prong accessory as well. big power, small size the xr150 delivers a full 2 watts of uhf power. this is business power that will give you clear communication at your facility. most competing radios in this class only offer 1 watt of power. all this power is in a radio that weighs only 4.8 oz and is only 3.9" tall, 1.9" wide and 1.1" deep. it's about the same size as an iphone which is incredible for a two-way radio. employee-proof construction if you have used radios for any length of time you know how hard people can be on their radios. dropping them, using them as a multi-tool, smacking in to walls while on their belt. we have been in the business since 1997 so we have seen it all. it still amazes us how much abuse the xr150 can take and keep on working for such a small radio. it has an all metal chassis and as few parts as possible (keeping it simple means better reliability and less to go wrong). this is why we can offer an in-house 2 year warranty and others can't. unbeatable price any comparable radio is at least $175 but with the xr150 you get best features and durability in it's class for only $139. package discount the xr150 is available in a package discount. get 10% off the entire price when you buy six radios, a six-bank charger and any six accessories! in stock last, and most important... we keep them in stock! thousands of them. so whether you order two or 200 we can ship them out the same day. most dealers do not stock at all. if they do, it's only a few. this means you end up waiting days, if not weeks for your order to even ship. not us. when you have a critical situation and need your radios immediately - order from discount two-way radio!
