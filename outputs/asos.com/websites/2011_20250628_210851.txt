equipment (weee) regulations. recycling electrical and electronic products – what you need to know. for asos customers this means hair straighteners and watches. q. what are asos.com's obligations according to the weee directive? as a distributor of eee asos.com, must facilitate the take-back of household weee from uk consumers and has decided to fulfil its obligations in this area byjoining the government approved "distributor take-back scheme" (dts) set up by valpak. by joining the valpak scheme asos.com is contributing to the establishment of a network of designated collection facilities (dcf) where consumers may dispose of their weee free of charge for recycling and treatment in an ecologically sound manner. in this way asos.com can ensure that weee is disposed of by customers in a way that optimizes its re-use and recycling. the recycling and treatment of weee itself is part of the producer's obligationunder the weee directive. as a consequence of our membership of the valpak scheme asos.com will not accept returns of household weee itself and cannotaccept weee returns for recycling, neither do we make arrangements for its collection. q. how will i know whether the new products i buy can be recycled? all new electrical and electronic products sold now carry a ‘crossed out wheelie bin’ symbol to help you identify which products are recyclable. you do not have to have purchased new electrical and electronic equipment to be able to recycle your old equipment. please help us to minimise the effect we all have on the environment by recycling your waste electrical and electronic products. q. how does asos.com ensure safe disposal of my weee? asos.com has decided to join the distributor take-back scheme (dts) commissioned by the british retail consortium. this scheme is run by valpak who are officially approved by the government. as part of this scheme we ask that you take your old piece of equipment to a designated collection facility (dcf) run by valpak in your area. an online search facility to help you identify a dcf near you is available on the following website: www.recycle-more.co.uk q. are there any other ways of disposing of my old electronic equipment? if your old piece of electronic equipment is still in a good working condition or could be repaired for further use, please consider donating it to a charitable organisation or by giving it to someone else in need. by extending the lifetime of your old equipment you are also contributing to the efficient use of resources and avoiding additional waste. q: why should i recycle my old electrical and electronic products? this is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the uk and our landfill sites are reaching full capacity. uk households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. this is the equivalent of 150,000 double-decker buses and would be enough to fill the new wembley stadium 6 times over. much of the uk's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk much of this waste can be recycled and the resources recovered to make new consumer goods. we all have a part to play in protecting our environment for future generations. remember, you can also take your old clothes to oxfam to be recycled. how do i search for a product? there are a number of ways you can

extra card number when prompted at the checkout. discount is not available on delivery charges, asos premier, sale items and gift vouchers. discount cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer. asos reserve the right to terminate this discount without notice. discount is only valid for nus extra cardholders and is non transferable. should a card number be used by anyone other than the cardholder, the discount will be withdrawn without notice. what is price promise? price promise is our commitment to you that if you see a branded (non-asos) product cheaper on another website, we will match that price. how does price promise work? simply let us know on which website you've seen it cheaper using the simple form on our contact us page. once we've done a few checks we'll send you a discount code for the difference so that you can buy the product you want at the lower price; it's as simple as that. better still, even if you've already made your purchase and then you see the product cheaper on another website we'll give you a discount for the difference to use on your next asos purchase! just let us know within 28 days. price promise terms and conditions we've tried to make it as straightforward as possible but there are some terms and conditions. all sales are subject to our main asos terms and conditions as well, and your personal data is still guaranteed by the asos privacy policy. price promise is only available on non asos own brand products that are available on www.asos.com. a price promise claim can be made before purchase or within 28 days of making your purchase. the product must be in stock and available to buy in the same colour and size on our competitor’s site. it must be full price and not reduced as part of a sale or promotion on our competitor’s site. the discount code for the price difference will only be sent once we have verified the price. our competitor’s price must be displayed and transacted in £ sterling on a uk website to enable us to make a price comparison. if you haven't already made your purchase the discount code will be valid to use on asos.com against the specific product being sold at a lower price on our competitor’s site. if you've already made your purchase, the discount code will be valid to use on your next asos purchase. discount codes will be locked to your account so that they can only be used by you. we do not offer a price promise on goods sold on discounted websites or on delivery charges. price promise discounts cannot be used in conjunction with any other discount or offer. we reserve the right to finally determine whether a website constitutes a ‘competitor’s site’. we reserve the right to reject price promise claims that do not meet the above criteria. this offer may be withdrawn at any time without notice, although claims made before the withdrawal will still be honoured. asos customer care - live delivery has my order been shipped out yet? i have received a faulty item i
