nienke 3/29/2010 i just placed my first order with bramble berry.  i poured over soaping blogs and the soap scent review board to choose vendors and scents and i was very impressed with the loyal following you've developed through quality products and solid customer service.  the vendor lists are huge, but there are 3 or so that really stand out when you read comments and reviews, and you are clearly one.  i'm not a pro-just soap for fun and give my product to family and friends, so i try to be very frugal when spending money on my hobby.  i thought you'd want to know what an easy choice using bramble berry was. amy 3/26/2010 hi anne marie. i just visited the website and i had to tell you it is awesome. i love how easy it is to find stuff. awesome new site. jane 3/24/2010 i love the samples-thanks sooo much! rebecca 3/24/2010 hi, i just wanted to say i am very impressed with bramble berry's full line of melt and pour soups.  they put the store bought brands to shame.  i am proud to say as i re-establish a past cottage industry and bath and body business and wait for my stock to grow and harden, i will definately not feel bad at all about using them.  i think i will even suppliment my soap supply with them because i feel the ingredients are superb quality.  the basic soaps smell fantastic and pure and the lather is very good. i am super happy!  thank you bramble berry i am a definate repeat customer for the future and best wishes on your business ventures... kimberly 3/16/2010 have i told you lately how much i love you guys? you rock!

i got my order of fragrances, witch hazel and citric acid in the mail-- and it made me absolutely giddy when i realized that there was a little sample tucked in there with the packing peanuts. the champagne scent is quite an interesting one!! thank you so much for shipping in a timely fashion, and for making sure that my order got here right on time. the only suggestion i have is that when you send one of the awesome little samples, be sure that the customer knows it's in there... i almost missed it, and would've cried if i realized that i'd accidentally tossed it out with the foam bits!! thank you again!! georgette 2/10/2010 ...you guys (and gals) are such a pleasure to work with. :] jason 2/8/2010 thanks so much for your fantastic customer service! elisabeth 2/7/2010 you guys rock!!!!!

thanks so much!! i have thrown away several bottles of fo because they stunk- not from brambleberry- the ones i have ordered from you smell awesome!! kathy 2/1/2010 thank you so much for your quality fragrance oils!  i had been using a fragrance oil i bought on another site, and found that it seized my soap up in my pot.  i checked out your site and read your comments on the fragrance oils and was able to figure out which oils to buy for my cp soap; they worked wonderfully!  they didn't seize up and they smell fantastic.thank you for testing the oils and letting your buyers know which ones work best in cp soap! gail 1/26/2010 hello, i am soooo happy i was told about your website!! i am just getting started in the soap making business and really found your website helpful in answering my questions. i look forward to your newsletter over here in wisconsin! barb 1/24/2010 you definitely have the best quality in fragrance oils - the scent is great in cp soaps, and, what i really love is that one can always trust the descriptions - "lilac" smells like lilac and not like something else and if there is a note that there is a slight acceleration in cp soaps, there really will be only a slight acceleration. i really could't find a comparable quality and service in europe so far! karin 1/21/2010 "i must say after receiving my soapy love delectable desserts and sweet treats, i noticed a warning that needed to be listed. "please do not use this product if you are on a diet or plan to start one as it is impossible to avoid sweets after smelling these heavenly fragrances." needless to say, the products are amazing and my stomach is growling!!! so good, i had to remember that they will not taste as good as they smell. thank you so much for a product that is as wonderful as it claims." julie 1/19/2010 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 advanced search view your cart specials web specials limited editions gift certificates products bases: melt & pour bulk melt and pour soap basebramble berry bases other soap bases bases: soap & body cold process soaprebatch basesliquid baseslotion baseslip & perfume bases books soaptoiletryothere-bookonline videosfree stuff candles colorantswaxcontainersfragrance oilswicks colorants labcolorssample packsmicaspigmentsglitterclaysliquid colorsnon-bleeding colorants essential oils originalorganicsynergy blends kits exfoliants seedsjojoba beadsnatural extracts fixed oils & waxes buttersfixed oilswaxes flavoring oils unsweetenedpre-sweetened fragrance oils alphabeticalbest sellerssample kitsfloralfruitytypescleanmasculinesweet herbs and botanicals holiday themes winter holidaysst. patrick's dayvalentine's day4th of julyhalloweeneastermother's daychristmas kits and samplers perfume kitssampler kitssoap kitstoiletry kits lotion supplies ingredientskitspre-made bases mineral makeup kitsingredientstools miscellaneous supplies soap ropesea saltingredientstoyslyetattoos molds new designs3dwood moldsby typestepping stonehearts & loveplants & animalsvariouskidsbudget molds packaging bagslip balmmetalreed diffusersbottleseverything else soap stamps soaping hardware toolsscales soapylove refill sizes surplus items miscellaneousfragrances oils resources lye calculator for soap makers fragrance calculator soap queen blog store policies and shipping info customer testimonials otion soap bar - soap classes metric conversion chart soap making success stories social responsibility statement our customers are talking about us!
