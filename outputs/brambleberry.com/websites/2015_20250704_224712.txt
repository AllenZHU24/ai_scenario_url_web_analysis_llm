questions or comments? we'd love to hear from you! write to us here. 2015201420132012201120102009200820072006 12 i would like to address how much i appreciate brambleberry's outstanding customer service! i'm regularly chatting and asking questions of rachel and other associates (when she's not available). i can't tell you how wonderful it is to have such positive and over the top response if there's a problem whether it's with a recipe or an error on an order. everyone is always willing to assist and even willing to take back an item i mistakenly ordered (but opened) or reconfigure an order for an item duplicated. who does that these days? brambleberry. anne-marie - you have a wonderful staff, the best customer service policies and i wish you and your employees the happiest holiday season! thank you for your excellent service maryann 12/1/2015 i just wanted to let you know. i just received my first order from you and am so excited. the scents are absolutely amazing!!!! i was even more impressed at how quickly the order came in. tracking showed it to be delivered this wednesday but it came in today!!

diana 10/23/2015 hi, i only wanted to comment on how thoroughly pleased i am with your website, and all the information that it provides. i am in the process of making cp soap and have always gone right to your sight using your lye calc. or your fragrance calc. and have never been disappointed in my end results. i have been purchasing from you for going on a year now and have been so satisfied with your products, your customer service and your wonderful soap making videos. i have learned more about soap making in the last year, after finding your website, than by any other website out there that sells similar products. i just felt the need to tell you how satisfied i am with bramble berry. keep up the great work! thanks again for everything!! janna 10/1/2015 i have to say, i have ordered from several different companies, and bought alot of products from alot of them, but brambleberry honestly has the best customer service.  so even though i can find the same products for less money elsewhere, i like buying from you because your customer service really cant be beat, and to me, thats worth the money. thank you again jennifer 9/30/2015 just a quick thank you to ann-marie and team. i sent a message via facebook but am not sure who actually reads that communication. i didn't have the best first experience with bramble berry with my very first order however i must commend you on your customer service. i am very satisfied with the priority you gave to me as a new client after i reported the poor condition in which i received most of my color blocks. i wanted to share my very first soap making experience with you. i purchase the rather costly rainbow hearts kit as a first project. i am indeed satisfied. the comments from my family have been priceless. i am sharing the photos with you to again say thank you and to let you know that it worked exactly as described. i also made another batch but with my own flare. i have named them both. ann-maries rainbow hearts have become my 'lots of love' soap and the second batch is called 'lovely'. customer 9/15/2015 wow, just tried the crisp pear in my soap, i am new to soaping and this is my first time trying a fragrance, sooo fun. sooo love it!!! ty for being such a wonderful resource!!! becky 9/2/2015 hi! everything arrived in perfect condition - another brilliant packaging job by bramble berry. thank you!! gaye 8/27/2015 i just wanted to acknowledge how professional and pleasant everyone is there and what a wonderful company brambleberry is. i am so impressed each time i visit your website or submit an order or ask a question. i find so many great projects on your site and the directions are so clear and well documented that i never have to question what is meant. i’m sure you hear this all the time but i just wanted to say thank you again. take care, lee ann ps. you make me wish i lived on the west coast. i know it is unrealistic but i sure wish you guys had an east coast distribution center as well. lee ann 8/17/2015 hello, just wanted to see if you can forward this message if you ever have a meeting or anything like that. i requested samples, and you were nice enough to throw in one i did not ask for. well, i ended up liking that one the best, and i would never have ever ordered that one. i really appreciate your samples, and your customer service, always there to answer my questions. it makes me feel loyal and i try to purchase most of the products that i can from you because of it. i also appreciate keeping shipping low as that can eat away at profit in no time flat. just wanted to say thank you! for being an amazing company and all the help that you have provided to me.  kari kari 8/17/2015 thanks so much for the great service you offer. every order is handled with such care and packaging is the best i have ever had from any company. love your products. just wanted to take a minute and let you know your appreciated. thanks, deb deb 8/10/2015 hi brambleberry,  i just wanted to leave a review thanking your staff for always being there for questionson facebook. i'm a new soaper and really had a lot of questions and anxieties which amanda, nicole, kelsey and other staff have helped me with. i shop at otion and appreciate the great selection of brambleberry products there. thanks again so much for everything!  victor victor 8/4/2015 hay there. i ordered a large amount so your essentail oils and serious soap making supplies. it was work but i loved it!!

all the products smell amazing. i can't wait to experiment with various types of scented body butters which has become a hobby during this current winter. what really stood out is the time that your company took to process & ship the order with a personal touch, the best word that i could describe is the pride taken into making a customer feeling valued is a huge plus.
