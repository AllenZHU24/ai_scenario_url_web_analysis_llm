usage rate calculator. it is simple to use; enter the amount of ounces you would like to scent, choose the product, pick your fragrance and click ‘calculate.’ the low to high suggested usage rates will pop up for you. though we generally suggest staying near the ‘medium’ suggested usage rates, you can safely add up to the ‘maximum’ rates if you like your products scented more strongly. we recommend always working with your recipes by weight for the sake of accuracy but in case you’re working in volume, we’ve included teaspoon measurements as well. thank you for being a bramble berry
