if (ags 0) flawless and internally flawless flawless: no inclusions or blemishes of any sort under 10x magnification. internally flawless: no inclusions, but some minor blemishes. vvs1 - vvs2 (ags 1-2) very very slightly included contains minute inclusions that are very difficult to see under 10x magnification, even for an experienced grader. vs1 - vs2 (ags 3-4) very slightly included contains minute inclusions when observed with effort under 10x magnification. an excellent value as there is no noticeable difference to the unaided eye from vvs. si1 - si2 (ags 5-6) slightly included contains inclusions that are obvious under 10x magnification and possibly to the unaided eye. i1 - i2 - i3 (ags 7-8-9) included contains inclusions noticeable under 10x magnification. an si1 should not have any eye visible inclusions, but si2 may, depending on the size and location of the flaws. customer service free fedex shippingâ® 30-day returns jewelry insurance terms & conditions about us a+ rating from bbb testimonials conflict-free policy why buy from adiamor contact live chat email us 1-877-627-5094 keep in touch with adiamor â© 1999-2015 adiamor. privacy policy site map blog abcdefg
