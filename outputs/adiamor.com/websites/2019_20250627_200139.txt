from start to finish adiamor delivered! the girls that i dealt with were amazing! happy to answer any questions i had and helped me choose the right diamond for me. i was able to call them and speak to the same girls each time. i ended up getting a larger diamond then what i originally wanted for only a fraction more of the cost and still under our budget! i had been into the jewellers in australia and could see flaws in each diamond i looked at without even trying so was a tad worried without being able to see diamond first but the girls assured me it would be clean and they were right. it's just perfect! we actually ordered two rings at the same time mine and my sisters and they were both better then we could of dreamt of. my sister got hers valued back in aus and it's worth over double what we paid!!!! one of my biggest worries with ordering from overseas was worrying if we would have hold ups or problems in customs. fedex took care of all of that, it was easy as answering the call and paying on over the phone. it was such an easy and fun experience. i paid for the ring on a wednesday it was shipped on the friday and i had it in my hands by tuesday, and i live in a rural town where postage can sometimes take for ever! my fiancé and i have been looking for the perfect ring for years and i just haven't wanted him to spend the money on something when we weren't happy with the quality, i hadn't walked into a jewellers and found one i loved. but this ring is amazing!!! my sister is so happy as well! we couldn't recommend adiamor enough! rene, gunnedah nsw amazing ring, amazing company! you guys rock! i called concerned about if the ring would arrive on time because i still needed her ring size. i was told to just email it after i get it and they would set everything up. the ring was beautiful but the customer service was even better. couldn't recommend you guys more honestly. completely satisfied. tyler, austin texas close log in or sign up the item has been added to your wish list. to save your wish list between devices, click below: continue to wishlist no results found. please broaden your search criteria using the filters above or give us a call at 1-877-627-5094 for further assistance. reset your search {} 0 customer service free fedex shipping® 30-day returns jewelry insurance terms & conditions track your order about us adiamor reviews testimonials conflict-free policy why buy from adiamor social media gallery contact email us 877-627-5094 213-627-5057 keep in touch with adiamor © 1999-2020 adiamor. | 510 w 6th st, suite 1200 los angeles, ca, 90014 | site map
