educationgift guideglossary metal educationpearl educationpendant guidewedding ring guide diamond cut a diamond's cut is considered to be the most important of the four cs. it is important to understand how a diamond's proportions and the relationship between them affects its brilliance, fire, and scintillation. most diamonds are "spread" in their cutting to retain maximum weight from the original rough diamond. this technique results in a heavier diamond and also sacrifices the potential fire and brilliance of the stone. the width and depth have the greatest effect on how light travels within the diamond, and also how light exits the diamond in the form of brilliance. shallow cut diamonds light leaks out of the bottom, brilliance is lost and the diamond appears watery, glassy and dark. a diamond with these characteristics is referred to as a "fisheye". deep cut diamonds light leaks out of the sides, brilliance is lost and the center of the diamond will appear to be dark. a diamond with these characteristics is referred to as a "nailhead". a diamond's cut is graded by several measurements. its depth percentage (a measurement of the height vs. the width of the stone) and its table percentage (a measurement of the diameter of the top facet of the stone vs. the stone's average width) are two key factors in determining the quality of a diamond's cut. these percentages are detailed on the gia or agsl diamond grading report that accompanies every adiamor loose diamond. experts express differing opinions on the best table size (the diameter of the largest facet on the top of the stone) and the best depth for a diamond, because these two factors alone are not sufficient enough to accurately judge a diamond's cut. other factors such as crown angle, girdle thickness, culet size, polish and symmetry all play a role in judging a diamond's overall cut quality. diamond characteristics polish & symmetry although polish and symmetry are graded under 10x magnification they can both have an effect on the overall appearance of a diamond. polish refers to the quality of the diamond's surface and includes such features as nicks, polish lines and abrasions. symmetry refers to the exactitude of the shape and alignment of the facets. off-center culet facets not properly pointed misshapen facets crown and pavilion misalignment off-center table table and girdle not parallel the polish and symmetry grades are listed on each diamond's detail page and within their accompanying gia or agsl diamond grading report. gia grades polish and symmetry as: excellent (ex), very good (vg), good (g) agsl grades polish and symmetry as: ideal (id), excellent (ex), very good (vg), good (g) adiamor does not carry diamonds with polish and symmetry grades
