toll on your diamonds. ordinary wear, including the use of hand lotions and hair care products and simple household work, can all cause buildup that can leave a hazy film on your diamond. this buildup will eventually cause your brilliant and gorgeous diamond to appear dull. to keep your diamonds looking their best, they require the proper attention and care. here are some pointers on how to keep your diamond ring looking as great as it did the day you received it. cleaning and security everyday activity can cause the setting of your diamond to loosen. we suggest removing your engagement ring every evening and visually inspecting it for any bent or loosened prongs. it is important to visit a professional jeweler every six months to a year to have your mounting checked and tightened. during this time, the jeweler can also clean and polish your engagement ring setting to look brand new. home care to maintain the brilliance of your diamond at home, a dipping solution can be made by using one part ammonia and six parts water. try scrubbing your diamond gently with a soft brush to loosen dirt. avoid brushing the metal itself, as this may cause it to scratch. storing your ring though diamonds are the hardest substance known to man and extremely scratch resistant, another diamond can scratch it. it is important to store your jewelry separate from one another, most preferably in a fabric-lined case or box with dividers. browse adiamor's selection of gorgeous diamond engagement ring settings, and search for your perfect diamond! if you have any questions or concerns about care
