twitter store locator since 1983 an inflating needle for a basketball. that was the item that long time friends and tennis partners mike kennedy and eric martin were unable to find anywhere near their downtown boston apartments. realizing they weren't alone in their failed quest for athletic gear in the city, they founded city sports in 1983 on massachusetts avenue near the fenway neighborhood. over time, athletic adults that lived, worked or studied in the boston area came to city sports for their selection of premium brands and authentic niche products. and with a renowned selection of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment droves of athletes made city sports their home when training for their next 10k road race, triathlon and everything in between. 28 years later, city sports has developed into an award winning specialty sports retailer with 21 metropolitan locations along the east coast. you'll find runners, yoga enthusiasts, cyclists and more who have made city sports their destination for training runs, expert advice from the staff and the latest gear to achieve their personal best. while times have changed, city sports' mission remains the same: to supply the urban athlete year-round with the latest performance sporting goods, sold by the most knowledgeable staff in the city, and in a fun and welcoming atmosphere. what we are all about an award-winning specialty sports retailer headquartered in boston, city sports is the premiere destination for urban athletes and active lifestyle enthusiasts.  the company operates 21 metropolitan stores across the east coast, with locations in boston, providence, new york, philadelphia, washington d.c., baltimore and atlanta.  city sports offers a comprehensive assortment of performance footwear, equipment and apparel from leading athletic brands, special niche brands and its proprietary "cs by city sports" line, all focused on outfitting the urban athlete who participates in running, triathlons, training, cycling, swimming, yoga and tennis.  city sports was named one of 2010's "50 best running stores in america" by the independent running retailers association in conjunction with forumla4media. women's
