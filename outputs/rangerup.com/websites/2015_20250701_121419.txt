a pre-order is an order that allows you to purchase an item that is arriving soon. these arriving soon items will be marked as “pre-order”. why pre-order an item? the benefit of pre-order items is that you can get the product at its limited, lower pre-order price. if the price goes up, you will not be affected. once a pre-order item is switched to an in stock item, it will return to its higher, in stock price. next, your chances of getting a product is much greater with a pre-order. at times a limited edition or a hard to find items may sell out before they actually come into stock. you may also face having to wait several months after its release, for it to become available again, if it comes back into stock at all. all pre-orders are on a first come first serve basis and are filled by the original order date. it is possible for an item to be sold out even as a pre-order due to limited supplies. under no circumstances will we fill an order out of sequence. when does my pre-order ship? each pre-order item has an expected “ship date” of 3-4 weeks. what if i order in stock merchandise with my pre-order? all items will ship together when your pre-order arrives. if you should need the in stock items to be shipped right away a second order should be placed. one containing the in stock items and another with the pre-order items. note: we do this to minimize the cost passed on to customers. can i split ship my order? if your order contains an in stock item and a pre order item, you do have the option to pay an additional cost to split ship your order. this option can be found during checkout. if you decide to add this option, then we will ship the in stock item via the shipping method you selected within our normal turnaround times and then ship your pre order item as soon as it arrives via usps first class. for example, you place an order for an in stock item and a pre order, select ups ground as your shipping option, and want to split ship your order. too easy. we will ship any and all in stock items via ups ground and as soon as the pre order item arrives, we will ship it via usps first class mail.
