"it's about the man next to you. and that's it."we've added hoot's full speech below.when i go home people'll ask me, "hey hoot, why do you do it man? what, you some kinda war junkie?" you know what i'll say? i won't say a goddamn word. why? they won't understand. they won't understand why we do it. they won't understand that it's about the men next to you, and that's it. that's all it is. price: $35.00sizeplease selectsmmdlgxl2xlru759please choose options to see stock status share | productsmen's gearwomen's gearheadwearother gearcombatives gearsimilar items: affiliates retailers privacy links contact us facebook faq
