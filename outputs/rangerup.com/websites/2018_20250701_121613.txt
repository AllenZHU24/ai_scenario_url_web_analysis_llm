the only difference between apo orders and any other order is that apo customers must use usps for shipping. for security reasons it is extremely difficult to ship anything to apos from any other shipping source. we apologize if this is an inconvenience. how long will my order take to arrive? it depends on your shipping method. we offer ups ground (5-7 days), ups 2nd day (2 days), and us postal service (7-14 days). apo orders must ship usps and arrival times vary greatly by location and the whims of the government. how do i return/exchange items?

no – we’ve been some places and done some things, but we’re not remotely trying to pretend we’re the toughest dudes around. we’re not even close and we respect the men and women who are out there getting it done every day. this is why we love to hear from you, so we know what is going on and can design shirts that you believe in. you’ve been there. you’ve done that. we just want to provide the cool t-shirt that reminds you that you have. why do you guys hate college? we don't hate college. we don't hate college kids. we went to college. we hate spoiled assholes that believe everything their professor told them and then try to force it down your throat as if your service was a bad thing or you don't completely understand the complexity of the situation you were involved in while deployed. what size should i buy? we have vintage and normal fit. the vintage are a little more snug and a closer fit due to the soft, vintage material of the shirt. women's sizes are on juniors so we recommend sizing up. international orders ranger up is not responsible for extra duties and fees that the country you live in may require. any extra fees associated with the order are the responsibility of the customer. we do not set the shipping rates ourselves, these are set up by our us postal service and do not reflect what other countries postal services charge. check your customs requirements before ordering. sign up for our newsletter and receive a special offer we are ranger up ranger up launched on 16 june 2006. we make shirts for the military and the patriotic americans who love the men and women of the armed forces. the guys that own this company either were or are still in the military. contact us 919-682-1475 info@rangerup.com 923 east trinity ave. suite h durham, nc 27704 quicklinks men women gear sale search size charts ru news ranger up grappling classic customer care about new visitors faqs returns and exchanges not a war story privacy contact #rangerup facebook twitter instagram youtube website by: search © 2019 ranger up | privacy policy secure shopping with 100% industry standard ssl american express diners club discover jcb master paypal visa
