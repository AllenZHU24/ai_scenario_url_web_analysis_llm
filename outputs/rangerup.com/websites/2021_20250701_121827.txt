shirts: ranger up offers two fits of shirts both with their own unique material, style, and shape. our vintage fit shirts fit about a half size smaller than our normal fit shirts. normal fit shirts we sell fit true to size. leggings: ranger up offers women’s leggings in two different styles- compression/performance fit and soft style.  both with their own unique material, style and shape. our compression fit is a thick 88/12 poly/spandex material. they are a tighter fit compared to other brands. we recommend sizing up 1- 2 sizes from your usual size due to this. our soft style is a thinner, amazingly super soft fit material that is more stretchy than our performance fit. we do recommend sizing up 1 in these due to the cut. interested in shirt club? please visit our rutc page to find out more about these exclusive shirts and the process involved! you can also find answers to many commonly asked questions specific to shirt club on this page. how long will my order take to arrive? it depends on your shipping method. we offer fedex ground (location based), fedex 2nd day (2 business days), fedex next-day (1 business day), and us postal service (7-14 days). apo orders must ship usps and arrival times vary greatly by location and the whims of the government. please also note that shirts, hoodies, and tank tops all take 3-5 business days to fulfill prior to shipment which then adds additional time for transit. bottom line, if you have questions or concerns, let us know and we will work with you. what is the order process? during the order process, at the time the payment has been completed you will receive an email with the order number letting you know we’ve received your order and it’s on its way through the fulfillment journey. at the time of shipment when our team prints the shipping label you will receive an email with the tracking information. this email will confirm your order is on its way out our doors to arrive at yours how can i pay ranger up?

the only difference between apo orders and any other order is that apo customers must use usps for shipping. for security reasons it is extremely difficult to ship anything to apos from any other shipping source. we apologize if this is an inconvenience. i just completed my order, but there’s this other awesome thing i just found that i want too! after orders are placed they immediately go into our production/fulfillment system. due to the nature of our fulfillment system we cannot add or combine existing orders. you shipped me the wrong thing! my thing was broke when i received it! what do i do?
