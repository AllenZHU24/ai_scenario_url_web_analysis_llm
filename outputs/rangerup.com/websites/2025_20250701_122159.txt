of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the website and elsewhere on the internet, which may include use of precise location and/or cross-device data, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“interest-based advertising”) (where permitted under applicable law), which may include sending you an ad on another online website after you have left the website (i.e., “retargeting”). we are not responsible for, and make no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties,

measures to protect against the loss of, or unauthorized access to, the information under our control. although we take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your information will always remain secure. 9. choices: tracking and communications options a. tracking technologies generally regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. browsers offer different functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately. also, tools from browsers may not be effective with regard to certain tracking technologies. please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the services may not work and when you revisit the services your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to online websites you visit. like many online websites, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “do not track” signal from a visitor’s browser. however, for information on how we address so-called global privacy control signals and online privacy preference signals, see the state privacy notice. b. analytics and advertising tracking technologies you may choose whether to receive some interest-based advertising by submitting opt-outs. some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the digital advertising alliance’s (“daa”) self-regulatory program for online behavioral advertising. to learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising, including use of cross-device data for serving ads, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the daa’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). some of these companies may also be members of the network advertising initiative (“nai”). to learn more about the nai and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your nai / daa browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. we support the ad industry’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. you may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from google analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the google analytics opt-out browser add-on. we may also use microsoft advertising websites. to learn about the data microsoft collects and how your data is used by it and to opt-out of

b. your consumer rights and how to exercise them as described more below, subject to meeting the requirements for a verifiable consumer request (defined below), company provides california and nevada consumers the privacy rights described in this section. if you are a customer or website visitor of ranger up or an authorized agent of a customer or ranger up website visitor, you can submit a request to exercise your consumer privacy rights, by using our consumer rights request portal [here], or calling us at 888-824-8826. if you are a business contact, or an authorized agent of such a consumer, complete our u.s. data subject action request form [here] and submit via email to privacy@airwavesinc.com and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). the consumer rights we accommodate are as follows: i. right to limit sensitive pi processing we only process sensitive pi for purposes that are exempt from consumer choice under u.s. privacy laws. ii. right to know/access residents of california are entitled to access pi up to twice in a 12-month period. iii. categories california residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the period that is 12-months prior to the request date: the categories of pi we have collected about you. the categories of sources from which we collected your pi. the business purposes or commercial purposes for our collecting, selling, or sharing your pi. the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your pi. a list of the categories of pi disclosed for a business purpose and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred. a list of the categories of pi sold or share about you and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale or share occurred. iv. specific pieces you may request to confirm if we are processing your pi and, if we are, to obtain a transportable copy, subject to applicable request limits, of your pi that we have collected and are maintaining. for your specific pieces of pi, as required by applicable u.s. privacy laws, we will apply the heightened verification standards as described below. we have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep pi longer than we need it or are required to by applicable law to comply with access requests. v. do not sell / share california has an opt-out from “selling” and “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising (use of pi from different businesses or services to target advertisements). we may sell or share your pi and, as these terms apply under u.s. privacy laws (e.g., use for targeted advertising). however, we provide u.s. consumers an opt out of sale/sharing. third-party digital businesses (“third-party digital businesses”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect pi about you on our services, or otherwise collect and process pi that we make available about you, including digital activity information. we understand that giving access to pi on our services, or otherwise, to third-party digital businesses could be deemed a sale and/or share under some state laws and thus we will treat such pi (e.g., cookie id, ip address, and other online ids and internet or other electronic activity information) collected by third-party digital businesses, where not limited to acting as our service provider (or contractor or processor), as a sale and/or share and subject to a do not sell/share opt-out request. we will not sell your pi, share your pi for cross-context behavioral advertising, or process your pi for targeted advertising if you make a do not sell/share opt-out request. opt-out preference signals (also known as global privacy control or gpc): some of the u.s. privacy laws require businesses to process gpc signals, which is referred to in california as opt-out preference signals (“oops”), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information. to use an oops/gpc, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the oops/gpc. we have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process gpc signals on our websites with cookies and other tracking technologies from third-party digital businesses. we process oops/gpc with respect to sales and sharing that may occur in the context of collection of cookie pi by tracking technologies online by third-party digital businesses, discussed above, and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable oops/gpc. we currently do not, due to technical limitations, process oops/gpc for opt-outs of sales and sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie pi). we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled oops/gpc; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use oops/gpc; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the oops/gpc. opt-out for non-cookie pi: customers or website visitors of ranger up can opt-out of the sale/sharing of your non-cookie pi (e.g., use of your email address for targeted advertising), by using our consumer rights request portal [here] , or calling us at 888-824-8826. if you are a business contact, complete our u.s. data subject action request form [here] and submit via email to privacy@airwavesinc.com and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. opt-out for cookie pi: if you want to opt-out of the sale/sharing of such pi to third party digital businesses, which only occurs on our ranger up website, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool [here]. this is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie pi and to non-cookie pi. our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. you must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use. since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. note that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool. we do not knowingly sell or share the pi of consumers under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years old, or the parent or guardian of a consumer who is less than 13 years old. if you think we may have unknowingly collected pi of a consumer under 16 years old, please contact us as described in section 11. we may disclose your pi for the following purposes, which are not a sale or share: (i) if you direct us to disclose pi (for example, to a shipping company to ship your order to you); (ii) to comply with a consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute company as defined above, or as part of a corporate transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. vi. right to delete except to the extent we have a basis for retention under applicable law, you may request that we delete your pi. our retention rights include, without limitation: to complete transactions and services you have requested; for security purposes; for legitimate internal business purposes (e.g., maintaining business records); to comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement; and to exercise or defend legal claims. please also be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of pi or content you may have posted. note also that, depending on where you reside (e.g., california), we may not be required to delete your pi that we did not collect directly from you. vii. correct your pi consumers may bring inaccuracies they find in their pi that we maintain to our attention and we will act upon such a complaint as required by applicable law. you can also make changes to your online account in the account settings section of the account. that will not, however, change your information that exists in other places. viii. automated decision making/profiling we do not engage in automated decision making or profiling. ix. how to exercise your consumer privacy rights if you

consumer rights request portal [here], or calling us at 888-824-8826. if you are a business contact, or an authorized agent of such a consumer, complete our u.s. data subject action request form [here] and submit via email to privacy@airwavesinc.com and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). x. your request must be a verifiable consumer request as permitted or required by applicable u.s. privacy laws, any request you submit to us must be a verifiable consumer request, meaning when you make a request, we may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, e-mail, phone number and/or account information. we will review the information provided and may request additional information (e.g., transaction history) via e-mail or other means to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual. we will not fulfill your right to know (categories), right to know (specific pieces), right to delete, or right to correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected pi. we do not verify opt-outs of sell/share or limitation of sensitive pi requests unless we suspect fraud. we verify each request as follows: right to know (categories) (available for california residents only): if you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your request to know categories of pi to a reasonable degree of certainty. if we cannot do so, we will refer you to this notice for a general description of our data practices. right to know (specific pieces): if you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your request to know specific pieces of pi to a reasonably high degree of certainty. if you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a right to know categories request if you are a california resident. do not sell/share & limit spi: no specific verification required unless we suspect fraud. right to delete: if you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your request to know specific pieces of pi to a reasonably high degree of certainty or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, depending on the sensitivity of the pi and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. if we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion request, you can still make a do not sell/share and/or limit spi request. correction: if you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your request to correct pi to a reasonable degree of certainty or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, depending on the sensitivity of the pi and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized correction. to protect consumers, if we are unable to verify you sufficiently, we will be unable to honor your request. we will use pi provided in a verifiable consumer request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose. xi. agent requests you may use an authorized agent to make a request for you, subject to our verification of the agent, the agent’s authority to submit requests on your behalf, and of you. authorized agents of a customer or ranger up website visitor can submit a request on behalf of a consumer by using our consumer rights request portal [here], or calling us at 888-824-8826. if you are an authorized agent of a business contact complete our u.s. data subject action request form [here] and submit via email to privacy@airwavesinc.com. please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). once your agent’s authority is confirmed, they may exercise rights on your behalf subject to the agency requirements of the ccpa. xii. our responses some pi that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a verified consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser id). we do not include that pi in response to those requests. if we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reasons in our response. we will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify consumer pi that we process to respond to your consumer request(s). in some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your pi and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest. we reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive pi yourself. we will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. if we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. you will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request. consistent with applicable u.s. privacy laws and our interest in the security of your pi, we will not deliver to you your account password in response to a consumer privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us. xiii. non-discrimination/non-retaliation we will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable u.s. privacy laws for your exercise of your consumer privacy rights. we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable pi. c. notice of financial incentive programs we may offer discounts or other rewards (“incentives”) from time-to-time to consumers that provide us with pi, such as name, phone number, e-mail address, ip address, or location. you may opt-in to incentives by subscribing to our newsletter to receive 15% off on your next purchase, or other loyalty and incentive programs we may offer from time-to-time (“program(s)”). each program may have additional terms, available on the program page or at program sign-up. the incentives will be described in the program page, or at program sign-up. if you subsequently wish to withdraw from the programs, the method for doing so will be explained in the program terms. we do not limit program participation to consumers that do not exercise their ccpa rights. however, a deletion request will not delete program pi because it is necessary to maintain your participation in the program. if you desire to delete program pi, terminate your participation in the program before making a ccpa deletion request. d. our rights and the rights of others notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use, and disclose your pi as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your rights under u.s. privacy laws. in addition, we are not required to honor your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or another person’s or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law. e. additional notice for california residents in addition to the ccpa, certain californians are entitled to certain other notices, as follows: this notice provides information on our online practices and your california rights specific to our online services. without limitation, californians that visit our online services and seek to acquire goods, services, money or credit for personal, family or household purposes are entitled to the following notices of their rights: i. california minors although our services are intended for an audience over the age of majority, any california residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use our services, and posted content on the service, can request removal by contacting us by completing our u.s. data subject action request form [here] and submitting via email to privacy@airwavesinc.com or, if you are a customer or ranger up website visitor, you can submit a request by using our consumer rights portal [here] or calling us at 888-824-8826, detailing where the content is posted and attesting you posted it. we will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. this removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. for instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines we do not control. ii. shine the light we may share “personal information,” as defined by california’s “shine the light” law, with third parties for such third parties own direct marketing purposes. california residents may opt-out of this sharing by contacting us at privacy@airwavesinc.com or 10700 valley view st., cypress, ca 90630 (attn: privacy). we will not accept shine the light requests by telephone or by fax, and are not responsible for requests not labeled or sent properly, or that are incomplete. this right is different than, and in addition to, ccpa rights, and must be requested separately. you must put the statement “shine the light request” in the body of your correspondence. in your request, please attest to the fact that you are a california resident and provide a current california address for your response. however, a do not sell/share opt-out is broader and will limit our sharing with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without the need for making a separate shine the light request. you can opt out by making a do not sell / share request as described in section 10(b)(v) above. contact us if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us by: email:
