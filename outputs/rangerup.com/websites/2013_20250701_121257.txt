what possible say should they have in the manner in which you destroy those who would destroy you?there was much that our founding fathers did not agree on: states’ rights versus federal rights, a standing army versus militias, how involved we should be with the international community, the manner in which we managed debt, and many more significant arguments that still rage today. almost universally, however, they believed in a man’s right to bear arms. a gun is the great equalizer. it protects a man from those who would do him violence. it protects a people from tyranny. it keeps a man free. the quotes on the subject are numerous, but thomas jefferson said it most clearly, “free men do not ask permission to bear arms.”they don’t need to.and any government that believes in a free citizenry would never infringe on their right to do so.body width (1" below armhole) s: 18 - m: 20 - l: 22 - xl: 24 - 2xl: 26 - 3xl: 28 body length (hps to edge) s: 27 - m: 29 - l: 31 - xl: 32 - 2xl: 33 - 3xl: 34 shoulder width (seam to seam) s: 17 - m: 19 - l: 21 - xl: 23 - 2xl: 25 - 3xl: 27recently viewed share | http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1489447.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106469508http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106331846http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1489449.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106492087http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106344482http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1489451.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106512470http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106359679 newsletter sign up: command center:- home- about us- view ruckhelp desk:- contact us- privacy- faq- affiliates- dealersshop for:- mens- womens- kids- jeans- signs- gear- custommorale & welfare- articles- videos- links- our athletes- our charitiesconnect with us: © atomshirm corp. all rights reserved.site design by: eystudios newsletter sign up: connect with us: © atomshirm corp. all rights reserved.site design by: eystudios mensmain menumensnew arrivals - men's t-shirtssale items!!!gift cardsshop all mensall mens t-shirtsmens normal fit t-shirtsmens athletic fit t-shirtsmens vintage fit t-shirtsmens hoodiescollared shirtsthe damn fewunapologetically americanheadwearjeansgear spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.womensmain menuwomenswomens new arrivalssale items!!!gift cardsshop all womenswomens t-shirtswomens hoodiesthe damn fewunapologetically americangearheadwear spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.kidsmain menukidsnew arrivals- kidssale items!!!gift cardsshop all kidsnewborn and toddler gearboys t-shirtsgirls t-shirtsposters spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.jeansmain menujeansnew arrivals- jeanssale items!!!gift cardsshop all jeansdark jeanslight jeans spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.signsmain menusignsnew arrivalsgift cardsshop all signsunit liquid metal signsmilitary badge liquid metal signspatriotic liquid metal signsflag liquid metal signs spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.gearmain menugearnew arrivals- accessoriessale items!!!gift cardsshop all gearglasswareleather goodspostersstickers and decalsbest of the restheadwear spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout. spend $75 or more and get free usps shipping. apply code freeship at checkout.free men don't ask permission normal fit t-shirtqty:$22.00total:
