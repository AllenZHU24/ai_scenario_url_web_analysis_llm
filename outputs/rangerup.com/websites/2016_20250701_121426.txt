nick: four days. tom: four days isn't a lot of time to make a decision like that. nick: i meant i need you here in four days. tom: okay, i'll do it. when he's not managing the operation he will usually be found drinking fine bourbon while putting together the latest star wars lego set, and trying to keep his retired military working dog from eating people. in his youth, he aspired to join the theatre. he once auditioned to play big foot in a local community production, but was told that he was too hairy for the role. thus ended his dream. to compensate for his lack of theatrical production, tom became loud. very loud. think of the loudest guy you know. then double that level of loudness. no. triple it. that's how loud tom is. like nick, he loves bourbon, caffeine, and combat sports, but he doesn't like 80s flicks, and that's what makes him a bad person worthy of your scorn. america. nothing like her anywhere, anytime, in the history of the world. soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, coastguardsmen, firemen, & police officers. basically, the crazy sobs that put their lives on the line every day for less pay than they deserve so that we americans can sit in front of our plasma televisions and watch crappy reality tv shows, drive nice cars, eat great food, and generally not have to worry about anything of substance. veterans. from george washington to the newest recruit and everyone else in between - thank you. patriots. we’re talking about the people that believe the fourth of july is more than just an excuse to set off fireworks, that flying the american flag all year long is a civic duty, that taking the time to send letters to our troops is an honor, and who realize that america wasn’t forged on the backs of journalists, politicians, or campus rallies, but rather through the suffering and discipline of steely-eyed men who refused to accept defeat. dogs. never trust anyone that doesn’t like dogs. they’re loyal. they’d die for you, and all they want in return is some dried food, some petting, and the occasional piece of bacon. reversing the growing oppression of the proletariat in today's society. we…uhhh…think this is a good idea. hot chicks. honestly, aren't they the reason we do anything? unappreciative americans. you know these losers – the guys that profess that america is the worst country ever created, threaten to leave if things continue the way they are, but never do and continue to churn out their 6, 7, and 8 figure salaries, complaining all the way to the bank. anyone with the balls to compare any of our elected officials to the nazis should be shot on sight. france. they never support us. they lose all their wars. they break all kinds of un trade restriction with our enemies. their "culture department" made using many english words illegal. all this, and they still have de gaulle (oh, we’re sorry) to try to play the "high moral ground" card as they take a back seat in the world’s struggle to defeat an enemy that threatens the very fabric of western civilization. we understand they’re busy, but how much time does it take to practice weapons dropping and white-flag waving? officers that roll into combat zones the last day of the month and leave the first of the next month. seriously…we know you guys get a tax break, but come on now, don’t colonels and generals make enough to cover their integrity? spoiled rich college kids. there’s really nothing like hearing a 19-year-old tell you how the world really works, while disregarding your experience overseas. that rocks. pseudo-intellectuals. particularly anyone that combines any of the following: econo, geo, political, socio, neo, and landscape or anyone who uses a philosopher’s name as a descriptive term (kantian, machiavellian, and orwellian are our least favorites). when combined with number 4 (above), we believe this is a crime against humanity. actors. we prefer puppets. paper cuts. they really, really sting. subscribe to our newsletter email address * about ranger up ranger up 923 east trinity ave. suite h durham, nc 27704 men women ranger up american liquid metal signs gear sale items about us contact us faq tim kennedy sign in / register wishlists gift certificates sitemap © ranger up hero theme by pixel union, powered by bigcommerce. search in ranger up search search * cart checkout shop men mens t-shirts mens normal fit t-shirts mens vintage fit t-shirts mens hoodies bestsellers leo unapologetically american t-shirts get fit or die caffeine and hate never outgunned the damn few t-shirts women womens t-shirts womens hoodies womens tanks leggings and crops bombshell premium ranger up american liquid metal signs american liquid metal- unit signs american liquid metal- military badge signs american liquid metal- patriotic signs old world vintage tin signs gear hats posters sharp things ranger up glassware greeting cards ranger up stickers and decals best of the rest sale items pages about us contact us faq tim kennedy account sign in / register wishlists returns gift certificates what are you looking for?
