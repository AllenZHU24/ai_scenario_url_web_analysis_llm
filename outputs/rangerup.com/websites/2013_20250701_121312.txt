unappreciative americans.you know these losers – the guys that profess that america is the worst country ever created, threaten to leave if things continue the way they are, but never do and continue to churn out their 6, 7, and 8 figure salaries, complaining all the way to the bank. anyone with the balls to compare any of our elected officials to the nazis should be shot on sight. france.they never support us. they lose all their wars. they break all kinds of un trade restriction with our enemies. their "culture department" made using many english words illegal. all this, and they still have de gaulle (oh, we’re sorry) to try to play the "high moral ground" card as they take a back seat in the world’s struggle to defeat an enemy that threatens the very fabric of western civilization. we understand they’re busy, but how much time does it take to practice weapons dropping and white-flag waving? officers that roll into combat zones the last day of the month and leave the first of the next month.seriously…we know you guys get a tax break, but come on now, don’t colonels and generals make enough to cover their integrity? spoiled rich college kids.there’s really nothing like hearing a 19-year-old tell you how the world really works, while disregarding your experience overseas. that rocks. pseudo-intellectuals.particularly anyone that combines any of the following: econo, geo, political, socio, neo, and landscape or anyone who uses a philosopher’s name as a descriptive term (kantian, machiavellian, and orwellian are our least favorites). when combined with number 4 (above), we believe this is a crime against humanity. actors.we prefer puppets. paper cuts.they really, really sting. http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1692523.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106469508http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106331846http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1692525.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106492087http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106344482http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-50863389838911/img-1692527.gifhttp://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106512470http://ep.yimg.com/ca/i/yhst-50863389838911_2271_106359679 newsletter sign up: command center:- home- about us- view ruckhelp desk:- contact us- privacy- faq- affiliates- dealersshop for:- mens- womens- kids- jeans- signs- gear- custommorale & welfare- articles- videos- links- our athletes- our charitiesconnect with us: © atomshirm corp. all rights reserved.site design by: eystudios newsletter sign up: connect with us: © atomshirm corp. all rights reserved.site design by: eystudios mensmain menumensnew arrivals - men's t-shirtssale items!!!gift cardsshop all mensall mens t-shirtsmens normal fit t-shirtsmens athletic fit t-shirtsmens vintage fit t-shirtsmens hoodiescollared shirtsthe damn fewunapologetically americanheadwearjeansgear get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.womensmain menuwomenswomens new arrivalssale items!!!gift cardsshop all womenswomens t-shirtswomens hoodiesthe damn fewunapologetically americangearheadwear get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.kidsmain menukidsnew arrivals- kidssale items!!!gift cardsshop all kidsnewborn and toddler gearboys t-shirtsgirls t-shirtsposters get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.jeansmain menujeansnew arrivals- jeanssale items!!!gift cardsshop all jeansdark jeanslight jeans get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.signsmain menusignsnew arrivalsgift cardsshop all signsunit liquid metal signsmilitary badge liquid metal signspatriotic liquid metal signsflag liquid metal signs get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.gearmain menugearnew arrivals- accessoriessale items!!!gift cardsshop all gearglasswareleather goodspostersstickers and decalsbest of the restheadwear get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout. get 12 of our shirts for the low price of $15 each! use code specialten at checkout.qty:$0.00total:
