we have vintage and normal fit. the vintage are a little more snug and a closer fit due to the soft, vintage material of the shirt. women's sizes are on juniors so we recommend sizing up. international orders ranger up is not responsible for extra duties and fees that the country you live in may require. any extra fees associated with the order are the responsibility of the customer. we do not set the shipping rates ourselves, these are set up by our us postal service and do not reflect what other countries postal services charge. check your customs requirements before ordering. sign up for our newsletter and receive a special offer we are ranger up ranger up launched on 16 june 2006. we make shirts for the military and the patriotic americans who love the men and women of the armed forces. the guys that own this company either were or are still in the military. contact us 919-682-1475 info@rangerup.com 923 east trinity ave. suite h durham, nc 27704 quicklinks men women gear sale search size charts customer care about new visitors faqs returns and exchanges not a war story privacy contact #rangerup facebook twitter instagram youtube website by: search © 2018 ranger up | privacy policy secure shopping with 100% industry standard ssl american express diners club discover jcb master paypal visa
