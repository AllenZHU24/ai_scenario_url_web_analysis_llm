the address verification service (avs) is a fraud protection service that checks a shopper's billing address against the card processor's existing address record for the shopper. avs returns a code that indicates how well the addresses match. if you receive an avs error message in regards to your order, it simply means that the shipping address does not match any address on file with your credit card company as an authorized shipping address. back to top of the page or customer service page. why must my shipping address be listed with my credit card company? the short answer is to protect our customer's personal information and stop credit card fraud. most companies only check the customer's billing address. once a credit card thief has this information it allows them to ship merchandise to any address. with this method it could be days or weeks before the fraud is detected. birthday direct takes it one step further and checks the shipping address too. as soon as a customer clicks the "submit order" order button on our site an address verification check is conducted. if the customer's shipping address is not on file with the credit card company the order is automatically put on hold and sent to our avs fraud team. to prevent a delay in your order, please ensure that your shipping address is on file with your credit card company as an authorized shipping address, alternate shipping address, or a one time shipping address. please note: we do not accept credit cards from non u.s. issuing banks or credit cards where avs is not supported by the credit card issuing bank. back to top of the page or customer service page. what payment methods do you accept?
