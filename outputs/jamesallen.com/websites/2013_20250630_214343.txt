a gemological institute of america (gia), american gem society (ags), or international gemological institute (igi) diamond certificate assures the value and quality of your diamond. gia, ags and igi are the gold standard in diamond grading. their reports detail key characteristics of each diamond. + what are the "four c's"? the four c's - carat (size), color, clarity and cut - are the industry grade standard from the gemological institute of america (gia). every diamond is specifically graded on these features. + what is "cut"? a diamond's cut determines how effectively it returns light to the viewer's eye: a well-cut diamond appears brilliant and fiery, while poorly cut stones look dark and lifeless. well-cut diamonds often appear larger than stones of the same carat weight. to learn more about cuts, click here. + what does the term "eye clean" mean?"eye-clean" is a term used to describe a diamond that is clean to an unaided eye in a face-up position from a distance of 8 to 10 inches. diamonds of vs2 or higher in quality will usually be eye-clean. diamonds of si1, si2 and i1 need to be visually inspected to determine whether any inclusions are visible from the top. we can inspect any diamond at no charge. + how can i make sure the diamonds i receive are actually the diamonds i ordered?we ship every loose diamond and diamond engagement ring with an independent gia, ags or igi lab report. this report can be examined by a qualified gemologist and compared against the unique characteristics of your diamond. + i found a diamond in your website that i like. is it available?yes. all diamonds on our website are available for purchase. + what is the quality of the diamonds used in your jewelry?smaller diamonds (often called melee) are cut in factories around the world and are available in a variety of qualities. the lowest quality goods are usually labeled as "commercial" and consist of i/j/k color and i1 clarity. "promotional" goods are higher in both color and clarity, but are still cut for maximum weight. the highest quality diamonds are often referred to as "collection". collection diamonds are finer in both color and clarity. they're precisely cut to maximize fire and brilliance. collection quality goods are only available from specialty dealers. we pride ourselves on using collection diamond melee in all of our engagement designs. + are any of your diamonds laser treated, clarity enhanced, color enhanced, or modified in any way? jamesallen only sells diamonds that are 100% natural and untreated.the gemological institute of america (gia), the american gem society (ags), and the international gemological institute (igi) will not issue grading reports on diamonds that have been treated or enhanced, so purchasing our diamonds - which are all gia, ags or igi certified -- is another guarantee that your diamond is natural. + are the gemstones used in your jewelry natural or synthetic?every gemstone used in our jewelry was mined from the earth. we do not sell synthetic or lab created gemstones. + are any of the gemstones used in your jewelry heat treated?yes. it is very common for natural gemstones to be heated. heating the stone can intensify color and clarity, making the gemstone more beautiful and valuable. in addition, emeralds are commonly infused with a colorless oil, wax or resin to improve their appearance and luster. nearly all rubies and emeralds on the jewelry market today are heated or treated in some fashion. + do the 18k white gold rings turn yellow over time? yes, very slightly. in order to give 18kt white gold a pure white color, it is plated with rhodium. this is a standard practice for 14kt and 18kt white gold jewelry. over time, the rhodium plating may wear off. when that occurs, the true color of the white gold (a slightly buttery off-white) will appear. james allen offers lifetime free rhodium plating on all our jewelry. + what are conflict-free diamonds? conflict-free diamonds are gems that were not obtained due to human rights abuses, child labor, violence, or environmental degradation. at james allen, we make sure that our customers receive conflict-free diamonds. our internal guidelines exceed government requirements. we manufacture most of our own diamonds, and therefore have first-hand knowledge of their conflict-free origins. we only purchase polished diamonds from professional members of the diamond trade. we have contracts with our suppliers that guarantee that their diamonds are conflict-free. when you shop at james allen, you can be certain that your diamonds are coming from the most reputable providers. read more about our conflict-free diamonds. + how often do you add diamonds to your inventory?we add new diamonds to our inventory on a daily basis. + can i trade in old jewelry towards the purchase of a new item? yes. we can provide you with a free quote on any gia, ags and igi graded diamond of 1/2 ct or larger. however, we do not accept used rings or uncertified diamonds. diamond in the rough + what is the diamond in the rough collection? diamond in the rough is the most renowned brand for natural, rough diamond jewelry. james allen has partnered with diamond in the rough to offer a stunning collection of natural rough diamond rings in a wide variety of styles. each setting is custom-designed to compliment the definitive beauty of the hand-picked rough center diamond, making these diamond rings truly unique. + what makes diamond in the rough ring different than a traditional engagement ring?traditional engagement rings usually feature polished diamonds or gemstones. a diamond in the rough ring is a beautiful alternative to a traditional polished and cut center stone, as it features an unpolished, uncut center stone. a diamond in the rough ring is a unique expression of love and is perfect for anniversaries, birthdays and valentine’s day gifts. a diamond in the rough ring can also be an engagement ring for those who prefer something distinctive. + what does it mean to have a rough center diamond?the center stones in diamond in the rough rings are unpolished and not cut. this is what gives them their unique, one-of-a-kind look. + how are diamond in the rough rings graded?diamond in the rough rings are evaluated by carat weight, color, and natural shape, but also on their inherent beauty and rarity. since each and every diamond in the rough piece is one of a kind, they cannot be measured using a typical standardized scale. + how can i care for my diamond in the rough ring? like all diamond jewelry, it is important to take care of your diamond in the rough ring. do not shower with your ring on to avoid solutions like hair products and soap getting underneath the stones. to clean your diamond in the rough ring, use a professional, nonabrasive cleaning solution. apply the solution with a soft bristle brush to remove residue and dust. payments + what types of payment do you accept?
