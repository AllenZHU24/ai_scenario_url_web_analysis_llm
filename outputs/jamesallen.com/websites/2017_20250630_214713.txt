carat weight diamond cut the cut of a diamond not only refers to the diamond’s shape, it also refers to how effectively the diamond returns light back to the viewer’s eye. a well-cut diamond will appear very brilliant and fiery, while a poorly cut diamond can appear dark and lifeless, regardless of its color or clarity. not only do well-cut diamonds appear more brilliant, they also tend to appear larger than other diamonds of the same carat weight. an "ideal" diamond has both increased brilliance and diameter relative to more deeply-cut diamonds. ideal cut diamonds an ideal cut diamond is a round, brilliant, or princess cut diamond that is cut to ideal proportions and angles, and has excellent polish and symmetry ratings. an ideal cut diamond is perfectly proportioned to refract light, producing that fire and brilliance up through to the table and crown. james allen offers a nice selection of ideal cut diamonds know at true heartstm hearts and arrows true heartstm seen from

dispersion & scintillation a well-cut diamonds exhibit three different properties: brilliance, dispersion and scintillation. as light strikes a diamond's surface, it will either reflect off the table of a polished stone or enter the diamond. the light that is reflected off the diamond is known as the diamond's brilliance. as light travels through a stone, some of the light rays are separated into flashes of color. this is known as dispersion. the result of dispersion—the separation of white light into its spectral colors— is known as fire. scintillation is flashes of color that are viewable as an observer moves a diamond back and forth. sign up for our email listmanwomanexperience james allen360° display technologyvirtual ring sizerrefer a friendbecome an affiliatecustom design
