tyler has entered a rehab facility to deal with an addiction to prescription painkillers. he has relied on the meds to help him deal with 10 years of performance injuries and wear and tear. with the help of my family and team of medical professionals, i am taking responsibility for the management of my pain and am eager to be back on the stage and in the recording studio with my bandmates joe perry, joey kramer, tom hamilton and brad whitford, tyler said in a statement to people. i love aerosmith; i love performing as the lead singer in aerosmith. i am grateful for all of the support and love i am receiving and am committed to getting things taken care of, he added. actress liv tyler says: my family and i are in complete support of my dad's decision to seek treatment. he is a courageous man. we love him and are so proud that he is getting help to balance his pain management, not just for himself but for his family, friends and fans. liv is the daughter of steven tyler and fashion model bebe buell, although the couple never exchanged wedding rings. steven, 61, has suffered many orthopedic injuries over the years that have left him with severe chronic pain and will require additional surgeries on his knees and feet says his physician, dr. brian mckeon. managing and controlling his pain has been challenging, and despite our use of alternative therapies and the creation of custom shoes built by a team of engineers from timberland, steven's pain has progressed. the balance between managing his pain and avoiding addiction is tenuous and difficult and his bravery in persevering through rigorous touring is admirable. as with many athletes, steven put his performance first as he struggled with acute pain for years, says dr. mckeon ... 12/22/2009 3:28:00 pmcarrie underwood engaged to mike fishercountry music star and former american idol winner carrie underwood is engaged to ottawa senator mike fisher. underwood, 26, has been dating fisher, 29, for more than a year. they were introduced by one of her band members. mike popped the question in front of friends and family on sunday. he texted the exciting news to his close friends soon after. he was pretty excited, said a source. she's a great gal and i think they're made for each other. a wedding date has not yet been set, but it seems as though the couple will exchange wedding rings in the near future. a rep for the couple confirmed the engagement: i'm happy to confirm that carrie underwood is engaged to mike fisher, and the couple couldn't be happier. no wedding date has been set at this time. fisher recently discussed his relationship with underwood on the sens show, a web news show run by his team: obviously, it's tough with our schedules to see each other, but we find a way to make it work. she doesn't get too many days off  a lot less days off than i get. she's always going. she's talented and she's getting rewarded for it. that's good to see. in the liner notes of her newest album play on, carrie wrote a sweet sentiment to her man: thank you #12. you are the most amazing addition to my life. i thank god for you every day. . . xoxo carrie. the #12 refers to fishers jersey number. ... 12/21/2009 2:11:00 pmbrittany murphy dead at 32actress britanny murphy, star of clueless and 8 mile, died sunday in los angeles of cardiac arrest. murphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m. at cedars-sinai medical center. she was 32-years-old. brittany was taken to the hospital after the la fire department responded to a call at 8 a.m. the call came from the home of murphy and her husband, british screenwriter simon monjack. murphy and monjack exchanged wedding rings in may 2007. according to assistant chief coroner ed winter, murphy apparently collapsed in the

12/20/2009 2:21:00 pmkevin jonas of the jonas brothers marrieskevin jonas, one-third of the disney rock trio the jonas brothers, married his girlfriend of two years, danielle deleasa, on saturday afternoon. the couple exchanged wedding rings in an outdoor ceremony right before a huge blizzard ravaged long island. the event took place in cold spring harbor at oheka castle  a nearly 100-year-old french-style chateau. in attendance were the 22-year-old grooms brothers, best men and bandmates, joe and nick jonas, and disney entertainer demi lovato. about 400 relatives and friends attended. jonas met his bride, a 23-year-old ex-hairdresser, during a family vacation to the bahamas two years ago. he surprised her last july by showing up on her new jersey doorstep with a three-carat solitaire cushion-cut diamond surrounded by 210 round, brilliant-cut pave diamonds. he designed the ring himself, with help from jacob the jeweler. she said yes, yes, yes like 500 times super fast in a row, he reminisced. danielle wore a vera wang gown made of chantilly lace and a designer silk-and-crystal flower in her hair during the ceremony. ... 12/17/2009 1:53:00 pmjon and kate will remain married until 2010it looks like jon and kate gosselin will remain married until next year, as they are currently waiting on a final divorce decree. a lawyer for jon says the reality star couples divorce is unlikely to be finalized until early next year. i guess the gosselins will be spending the new year as a married couple. jon and kate exchanged wedding rings in 2009. it was announced on the june 22, 2009 episode of jon and kate plus 8 that the couple was separating, and that divorce proceedings had begun. the duo has been married for over 10 years. mark jay heller, jons lawyer, revealed that the arbiter's decisions on custody and finances are a work in progress. he says the couple has not signed off on it, but that the arbiter's decisions will be final. in related news, it seems that jon may be broke. last week, tlc was granted an injunction that forced jon to stop making public appearances. according to a source, the injunction dealt a serious blow to jons financial situation. jon's in pretty serious financial trouble because his plan for making money was shut down in court. he has warned his lawyers that he can't pay them and if he doesn't succeed against tlc, he will have no funds. he's even gone so far as to say that if they want to be paid, they will have to sue him, the source revealed. jons lawyers are part of a father and son team. they were introduced to gosselin by michael lohan, linday lohans father, claims the source. mark and mike heller were brought in because michael lohan was involved, and he convinced them to join jon's team early on in the summer. lohan wanted to latch onto jon and involved many people he knew. he convinced them jon was going to have a successful career after the show. ... 12/16/2009 5:44:00 pmrussell brand shopping for engagement ringits no secret that russell brand has been dating pop sensation katy perry for several months now. well, looks like their romance may be heating up, because brand has been spotted out shopping for an engagement ring says news of the world. although news of the world isnt always the most reliable source of news out there, there are picture of brand looking at engagement rings. the notorious ladies man may be ready to tie the knot  perhaps over christmas? the store manager confirms that brand is looking for something special for his lady. his face lit up when he saw this one diamond ring. he put it on his hand and he just gazed at it for ages, deep in contemplation, he says. even though pictures show the comedian looking at diamond rings, there is no word yet on whether he made any purchase. brand has repeatedly told the media that he was head over heels in love with kate, even hinting that he was having very serious thoughts about their future: shes the one. im a one-woman gentleman now. shes really funny and gorgeous. were having a lot of fun. ... 12/15/2009 3:52:00 pmcourtney love loses custody over frances beancourtney love and kurt cobain exchanged wedding rings in 1992. six months later the couple gave birth to daughter francis bean cobain. it was to be the only child the pair would have, since kurt committed suicide in 1994. now, frances bean has been taken away from courtney and placed in a temporary guardianship according to court records. a los angeles superior court commissioner granted control of the 17-year-old to kurt cobains mother, wendy oconnor, and his sister, kimberly dawn. the court filing doesnt state a reason, nor does it mention courtney love. in recent months, loves behavior has been quite erratic. the former frontwoman of rock band hole has been criticized for blog post ramblings that have attacked jews, a former bandmate and others. in fact, a notable fashion designer sued love earlier this year over some posts, claiming they were libelous. in september 2005, love was sentenced to 180 days at a drug treatment facility for violating probation in three misdemeanor cases  one for illegal possession of painkillers, one for being under the influence of a controlled substance in public and another for assault and battery. a three-page court order issued on friday was all that was made public regarding the guardianship. attorney geraldine wyle - who is handling the case for kurts mother and sister - says it is a private family matter and no other comment would be issued. love's publicist alan nierob said he didn't have any details about the guardianship. ... 12/14/2009 12:41:00 pmelin nordegren removes her wedding ringbetrayal is a bitter pill to swallow. for mrs. tiger woods that betray came in droves. perhaps thats why elin nordegren promptly removed her wedding ring after discovering the truth about tigers various infidelities. tiger woods wife has removed her wedding ring after 5 years of marriage  just a few days after elin revealed that she planned to stay married to tiger for the sake of their two children. she was spotted out and about without her gold band and diamond engagement ring. the blonde swede took the couple's two children to a christmas party in florida on saturday. it was revealed that the couple was visited by the florida department of children and families earlier during the day. according to reports, agency workers wanted to check on the welfare of the children. tiger, 33, recently announced he will take an indefinite break from golf in a bid to save his marriage and become a better husband, father and person. but some reports suggest that elin is planning a divorce next year  a rumor fueled by the removal of her wedding ring. a source said: she's putting on a brave face but she's hurting terribly. tiger is doing everything he can to save his marriage but i can't see them getting through this. the wounds are too deep. here is a statement tiger issued regarding his professional and personal future: ... 12/13/2009 3:25:00 pmjon gosselin loses in courton thursday, a maryland judge ruled that jon gosselin must stop making media appearances and endorsements that breach his tlc contract. for example, the celebrity dad recently hosted a las vegas pool party. this was illegal according to his contract. montgomery county circuit judge michael d. mason granted tlc a preliminary injunction, pending the outcome of an april 19 trial. mark heller, gosselin's lawyer, said he was confident gosselin would eventually win the case. he also suggested that tlc should be anxious to settle so they can resume their hit reality show jon & kate plus 8, which ended recently due to legal dispute and the gosselins' pending divorce. the couple exchanged wedding rings in 1999. jon gosselin holds the key to the 'jon & kate plus 8' brand, said heller. gosselin's lawyers claim the contract allows certain media appearances, but the judge said that wasn't how he interpreted the contract. tlc chief operating officer edward sabin testified that gosselin has made many media appearances and endorsements that are not permitted in the contract. he also complained that gosselin drank alcohol and hung out with women in public  actions that go against the wholesome image of the show. he also said that the public statements gosselin made about the show and the network were embarrassing. in particular, sabin mentioned the las vegas pool party that gosselin hosted at the mgm grand hotel. what we wanted to avoid was exactly what happened. the next day in the tabloids were photos of mr. gosselin surrounded by bikini-clad women, sabin lamented. ... 12/10/2009 6:05:00 amtom brady and gisele welcome a baby boynew england patriots quarterback tom brady and supermodel gisele bundchen have welcomed a baby boy. brady announced the boy was born tuesday and that he and his wife have not yet chosen a name. he said it was a wonderful experience in my life. he added: everyone's great. i didn't get much sleep. brady also has a 2-year-old son, jack, with actress bridget moynahan. gisele is a first-time mother. brady and bundchen exchanged wedding rings during a small ceremony in los angeles this past february. in april, they held another wedding ceremony in costa rica for friends and family. on wednesday, brady showed up 16 minutes late for his weekly media availability. the patriots have lost three of their last four games and their record has dropped to 7-5 as a result. they lead the afc east by one game and play at home sunday against the carolina panthers. brady said it was important for him to come to work wednesday. i owe it to the guys in the locker room to really focus on what i need to do for this team and put all these emotions aside and kind of come in here with a great sense of determination on what we have to do as a team. so, as a captain and a leader of this team, the last thing they need from me is to be really not focused on the job at hand. there's plenty of things for me to really be doing here this week. ... diamond fashion news
