absolute pleasure from start to finish. a few highlights: - various folks over there (specifically diana flor) put up with many emails from me over a period of atleast 1-2 months from start to finish. - i was able to call, text or email with questions at any time and always had a (friendly!) response within hours. - i don't think i've ever 'met' more patient and helpful salespeople than those who work at ja. i'm not the easiest client and they were nothing short of perfect. - the entire process is seamless from choosing a diamond to the setting that suited what i wanted (i actually sent them a photo of a ring setting i found locally and they quickly suggested the best fit from their inventory and suggested what to do to change it to match the ring i had in mind--- i actually liked their design better at the end!!). the entire process is smooth. - no up charge for a slight customization. i received my ring within 2 weeks of ordering and was absolutely blown away. the packaging is gorgeous and the beautiful brown box in the middle held the prettiest ring i've ever seen. i couldn't believe what my money had bought with james allen!!! trust me- i was not 100% sold on buying online but this experience was not only painless but actually enjoyable. i would absolutely suggest to any family or friend in need of diamonds to head to james allen! k. h. 10/10 (dec 06, 2013) julie lubin, one of the gemologists at jamesallen.com was very courteous and professional when she assisted me with a diamond purchase i made for an engagement ring. she made sure i understood all of my options, what to look for in a diamond, and followed up with me to keep me in the loop about every aspect of the order and purchase. she is truly an asset to this company. thanks, julie, for all of your help while i made one of the most important purchases in my life. - rex rex g. 10/10 (dec 06, 2013) i recently purchased an engagement ring from james allen. before finding out about the website i did a lot of research and shopping around both online and in local stores. i was looking for a cushion cut diamond with a halo setting, but was having a hard time finding exactly what i was envisioning. the online stores had huge selections but i didn't feel comfortable buying something i couldn't see beforehand especially since cushion cut diamonds are notoriously difficult to judge based on a diamond report alone, and none of the local stores had the diamond and ring that i wanted in my price range. after a little more research i finally found the james allen website and was immediately impressed. it was very simple to filter down their selection to exactly what i wanted and pick out a couple to compare. i felt much more comfortable with the diamonds i was looking at since you could actually see them in the videos they post. the thing that really sealed the deal for me though and convinced me to purchase through james allen was my discussion with a customer service rep named greg. i had narrowed my selection down to a couple of diamonds but had no idea how to pick between them. i contacted the rep through their online chat option and told him what i was considering. he was able to actually pull all of the physical diamonds out of their stock and and answer my questions about them. and even though i had done a lot of research already he was able to give me an even better understanding of the characteristics of cushions and was able to steer me to the perfect one without being pushy. i never felt at any point that i was being pushed towards something i didn't want and appreciated the change of pace from most other ring shopping experiences i had had already. i decided to buy the diamond and setting, let ja combine them for me and ship them to me. when it arrived a couple weeks later i was very impressed with the packaging and the ring box and of course the ring itself, it was perfect. i proposed last week, and my now fiancã© absolutely loves the ring. i have really appreciated the service i've gotten from james allen, and would definitely recommend anyone looking for an engagement ring to check them out p. o. 10/10 (dec 06, 2013) look no further than james allen (ja)! my first online purchase of a diamond and my first custom ring design met 100% of my expectations. i was very apprehensive about doing this and did so holding my breath. however, each step along the way convinced me that i had made the right decision in selecting ja. from the beginning, i was truly impressed with the level of service, starting with david chiarenza, who listened to my needs, reserved my diamond while i contemplated design options, and offered suggestions from current ja styles. the price i paid for my true hearts diamond was a deal compared to other online dealers of âhearts and arrowsâ diamonds and it arrived quickly. it was everything that i had hoped it would be. however, a lot of the guesswork is removed when you can see 360 degree magnified images of the diamonds, as well as the grading certificates, on the ja website before purchasing. what a fantastic feature!!! i then started the custom design process of the setting with jillian murphy. jillian was truly a pleasure to deal with. she promptly answered every single email question i had with professionalism and reassurance. on several occasions, she offered personal advice and guidance that was very much welcomed. she was patient with each and every painstaking detail that we went through during the cad process. she kept me informed of each and every step right up until the manufacture of the setting. i canât say enough good things about jillian. i wish i knew the name of the jeweler who made the ring as my wife and i could not have been more pleased with the final product we received. i still catch her staring at her hand! the final product was exactly what we designed and envisioned when we started this process and was delivered on time (exactly 3 weeks after order finalization). we couldnât be happier with the ring and would not hesitate to recommend ja to anyone looking for high quality jewelry and outstanding customer service. brian r. 10/10 (dec 04, 2013) great experience. i purchased a .92ct diamond engagement ring in a platinum setting. the website is detailed and the photos are high resolution. the diamond and setting were exactly as i expected and the staff was very helpful. unfortunately i had to change the setting to suit my fiancees tastes, and the exchange process was fast and easy. i will use james allen in the future. p. s. 10/10 (dec 04, 2013) i was very apprehensive about purchasing a ring online. however after reading reviews and doing some research i realized that james allen has a great reputation. the service was excellent from beginning to end. the ring came in a beautiful box. the ring itself more than met all expectations. all in all i'm very satisfied and would recommended james allen to anyone looking for a quality, beautiful ring at a fair value. dominique h. 10/10 (dec 04, 2013) i was looking on jamesallen.com at a platinum three stone round diamond engagement ring. i had questions about delivery and the matching wedding band. i spoke to julie lubin and she was extremely helpful. she not only answered my questions, she also helped me pick a center diamond that was more affordable than the one i was considering. julie checked with their production group to verify that the ring could be completed and delivered before my planned flight to surprise my girlfriend. her personal touch put my mind at ease. the ring was delivered on time and was dazzling. my fiancã© was surprised by the proposal and is thrilled with the ring. because the proposal was a surprise, the ring size wasn't quite right. jamesallen made it very easy for my fiancã© to return the ring for resizing, without cost or question. thank you julie and jamesallen robert d. 10/10 (dec 03, 2013) i must admit i was very skeptical with purchasing an engagement ring online. but my girlfriend, the ultimate online shopper insisted that we had nothing to loose, and i have to admit, she was right. i donât think i can express all my thoughts about the ring. the wide cross prong solitaire setting is elegant in its simplicity. we opted to set it with a true hearts princess cut diamond and it is absolutely magnificent. i have never seen a diamond that sparkles with the fire of this diamond. i donât think there is enough i can say about the quality of the setting and the diamond. my customer service representative, greg rooney, was very professional and extremely helpful throughout the purchase of the engagement ring. i would recommend james allen to anyone looking to purchase high quality jewelry online. sincerely, danny t. danny t. 10/10 (dec 03, 2013) in late august, i started my search for my fiancã©es engagement ring. i was looking for a platinum setting with side baguettes. image searches on google provided repeated results to the james allen site. i was more than a bit apprehensive about purchasing a diamond online and continued my due diligence researching online purchasing. i read numerous comments and reviews on online forums and realized that online diamond purchases are fairly common and that james allen had very favorable reviews. i made numerous visits to brick and mortar stores in the west palm and south florida area and in comparison to the loose diamonds i was considering from james allen in the ring setting i had decided upon, it was significantly more cost effective to purchase from james allen. at the beginning of november i contacted lisa bagnall at james allen who would assist me through the entire ordering process. the number of loose diamonds available at james allen was a bit overwhelming but i was able to limit my possible stone selections to seven stones and saved them them to the site wish list. when i called and spoke directly with lisa, i provided her with the sku number for each stone and we discussed each stone before selecting a 1 ct true hearts ideal stone. lisa held my order until i was able to arrange for a wire transfer. in addition to my confirmation order, lisa also provided me the ags grading certificate number which i was able to reconcile on the ags site. i was feeling more at ease with the process and just needed the ring to arrive prior to thanksgiving. lisa provided me updates on my order throughout the process and i received the ring via fedex four days earlier than expected. on the day, with family gathered at the house, we were out by the pool in the morning and as i hugged her from behind and said how great it was to have the family together and the only way it could get any better is if she would marry me. after eight years of being together, i pleasantly shocked her. it's been a week and on a regular basis, i catch her looking at the ring and she said she couldn't have picked out a more beautiful ring herself. thank you lisa and the entire staff at james allen for the great customer service and follow up. i'll be calling again when we set the date to purchase the matching band to the engagement ring. bruce d. 10/10 (dec 03, 2013) i began my search for an engagement ring with nearly no knowledge about diamonds or engagement rings. after a few days of research on what things to look for in a diamond and a ring, i determinined what i was looking for. i was stunned with the value of the diamond (and ring) i found on james allen that was still within my budget range. it felt like one of those deals that should be purchased right away before anyone else discovered how great the value was. angela brown assisted me in holding the ring i had chosen over the weekend and was prompt in assisting me in the purchasing process and delivery. i was very impressed with the shopping experience, service, packaging, and the ring itself...so was my girlfriend (now fiance). that ring has had her mesmerized ever since! roman h. 10/10 (dec 02, 2013) read more bizrate great website. great product. dan (dec 06, 2013) engagement ring was exactly what i wanted and on

end as timelines were extremely tight and very important to us, but james allen came through and the ring arrived on time. all the way through the staff were very accessible and prompt in responses and updates which was very much appreciated.thank you. anne0902 (nov 24, 2013) i sent 2 emails to support staff with the same questions in them and they were never answered. staff assumed that i had made a mistake in ordering but only showed me the data from their end. jp (nov 23, 2013) the great reviews are well deserved. this is a fantastic company that is very easy to deal with a+++ (nov 22, 2013) i have made several purchases over the years and each and every time has been a wonderful experience. thank you for the wonderful service! kristina (nov 21, 2013) having the ability to view 360 degree image of diamond was one of the key factors in giving me the needed comfort to purchase a diamond online. this feature clearly sets ja apart from blue nile.the ability to view the various diamond online with 360 degree views, and j a 's money back guarantee. will see how well they did once my ring is received. mike (nov 18, 2013) i purchased an engagement ring, and among the online websites i visited, james allen provided the most information for each diamond (mainly by providing a video of each diamond they sell). they provide excellent service, with little details like great packaging and after-purchase support (they had taken a video of the finished ring, and sent me a link to view the video online a few days after the purchase), with knowledgeable staff available 24/7. i highly recommend james allen based on my own purchase. (nov 18, 2013) everything was perfect on my purchase, except that you dont deliver to chile.everything with this store y amazing, except that you dont deliver to chile, where i live in. so when i want to make a new purchase, i need to send it to a friend. francisco (nov 18, 2013) it was great to buy in james allen amonsanto (nov 18, 2013) please understand, i think james allen is a great company as they have been fantastic throughout my purchase. the reason i have given low scores is because fedex were exceedingly poor in their delivery, an issue i raised with james allen staff. i received a prompt courteous response that explained the issue was not due to james allen and, having investigated this matter further, i am satisfied that this is true. the likelihood of me ordering again is only lowered because i was buying an engagement ring and am living in the uk. it's a very specialised item, so i doubt i'd have need to buy anything similar again (nov 16, 2013) the upscale packaging for the engagement ring was a very nice surprise. jaguar (nov 13, 2013) the website was great and really made it easy to purchase with confidence. the order shipped on-time and the packaging and documentation was excellent. i am impressed.
