"eye-clean" is a term used to describe a diamond that is clean to an unaided eye in a face-up position from a distance of 8 to 10 inches. diamonds of vs2 or higher in quality will always be eye-clean. diamonds of si1, si2 and i1 need to be visually inspected to determine whether any inclusions are visible from the top. we can inspect any diamond at no charge. + - what is "cut"? a diamond's cut determines how effectively it returns light to the viewer's eye: a well-cut diamond appears brilliant and fiery, while poorly cut stones look dark and lifeless. well-cut diamonds often appear larger than stones of the same carat weight. + - what kind of diamonds do you use for accent stones? smaller diamonds (often called melee) are cut in factories around the world and are available in a variety of qualities. the lowest quality goods are usually labeled as "commercial" and consist of i/j/k color and i1 clarity. "promotional" goods are higher in both color and clarity, but are still cut for maximum weight. the highest quality diamonds are often referred to as "collection". collection diamonds are finer in both color and clarity. they're precisely cut to maximize fire and brilliance. collection quality goods are only available from specialty dealers. we pride ourselves on using collection diamond melee in all of our engagement designs. + - are any of the gemstones used in your jewelry heat-treated? yes. it is very common for natural gemstones to be heated. heating the stone can intensify color and clarity, making the gemstone more beautiful and valuable. in addition, emeralds are commonly infused with a colorless oil, wax or resin to improve their appearance and luster. nearly all rubies and emeralds on the jewelry market today are heated or treated in some fashion. more home > education education center loose diamonds it's important and advisable to learn about diamonds before you purchase one. diamonds are complex, with many attributes that affect their overall beauty and quality. at james allen’s education center, you go beyond the “four c’s” (cut, color, clarity, and carat weight) and learn about everything that gives a diamond both its beauty and its value. learn more fancy color diamonds fancy color diamonds are extremely rare stones. approximately one out of every 10,000 naturally produced diamonds are considered “fancy colored.” the term “fancy” was coined by the gemological institute of america to distinguish between natural-color polished diamonds which display color and white diamonds. learn more gemstones natural gemstones, like diamonds, have different grades of quality, and it is important to educate yourself about the qualities that are assessed to determine the overall value of your chosen stone. learn more diamond in the rough diamond in the rough is the most renowned brand for natural, rough diamond jewelry. a beautifully inspired alternative to a polished center stone, a diamond in the rough transforms a traditional engagement ring into a one-of-a-kind expression of uniqueness. learn more engagement rings when designing the engagement ring of your dreams, there is so much to consider. presented with almost limitless combinations of settings and diamonds, it is easy to get flustered. by doing the proper research and asking the right questions, you will be able to design the perfect diamond engagement ring with little effort. learn more wedding rings these symbols of lifelong commitment not only reflect the two of you as a couple, but each of you individually as well. while a wedding ring should, in some way, be similar to the engagement ring it sits next to, it need not also be similar to the man's wedding band. once you have chosen an engagement ring, finding the right wedding ring is easy. learn more fine jewelry fine jewelry is a welcome addition to any woman's collection. pearls, gemstones, diamond studs and pendants compliment any occasion and add a touch of class. although personal taste and style dictates what type of fine jewelry fits what type of situation, there are certain things you should consider. learn more see also what is your ring size? find your ring size online in just a few steps or request a ring sizer. find ring size ring manufacturing learn all about creating the perfect engagement and wedding ring. learn more still have a question?
