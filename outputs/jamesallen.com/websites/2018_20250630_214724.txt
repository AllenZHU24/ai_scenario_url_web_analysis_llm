(full article) news(june 25, 2015) the james allen story once upon a time... four creative minds, oded edelman, james schultz, michele sigler and dean lederman, combined their talents to create jamesallen.com – and it soon became the largest privately held online diamond and bridal jewelry retailer in the world. their mission: to offer consumers online the highest quality diamonds and largest selection at the best price. for three generations, oded edelman’s family was famous for having the most discerning eye in the diamond business. oded, a relentless innovator, was determined to marry his heritage with the way people shop today – online. james, an early adopter to the internet with an expertise in online retail, was looking for an engagement ring and bought it from an online auction site. when he asked jewelers what it was worth, he discovered he had gotten a high-quality diamond for half the price it would have been in a store. michele, the lucky receiver of that beautiful ring, joined her husband james in the venture and brought her retail experience along to help oversee the customer service operations. dean, a diamantaire with 20 years of experience overseeing the manufacturing and international distribution of polished diamonds, joined forces with oded, james and michele to bring expert operational and financial management to the business. if we do say so ourselves today, jamesallen.com is the only retailer to present each of its ring settings and more than 200,000 conflict-free diamonds – all hand-selected – in highly magnified 360° hd. in
