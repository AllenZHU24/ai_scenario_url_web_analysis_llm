our goal is to provide you with the most up-to-date, easy to use pest management solutions on the market that professional pest control companies and exterminators use, but at a fraction of the cost. we have the most current selection of professional grade traps, baits, sprays, insecticide, rodenticides, and other supplies you need to get rid of any type of pest, including professional products for rodent control and roach control and all crawling insects. we even carry glyphosate herbicide and a wide selection of natural and organic pest control products for some non-toxic, environmental methods of control! why buy the expensive name brands when you can buy the same pesticide active ingredients and insecticide and do it yourself for significantly less? did you know that the average cost to hire an exterminator to do a general spray treatment around the outside of your home is about $70 per application, but that you can buy a bottle of talstar or bifen it, and do it yourself for around $4 per application? that's a lot of money back in your pocket!
