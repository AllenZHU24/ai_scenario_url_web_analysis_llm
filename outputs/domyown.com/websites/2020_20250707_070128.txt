this stuff is amazing! received my orderthursday. put small amount all over my kitchen. made sure the roaches didn’t have anything to feed on but the advion. the next morning my kitchen floor was covered. i swept the kitchen and left for a few hours and when i returned the floor was covered again. let me just say i have been fighting with this problem for years. i have had contract with terminix, mom and pop exterminators. you name it i’ve done it. i’m very excited about this product." s houston, texas 09/05/2020 "i searched other websites for fastcap and yours was by far the best price out of all (and an easy to use site). my former pest control guy of 20+ years in phoenix az got me a bottle of this when i moved out of his area to a new home 100 miles north, with no known pest control companies near and way out in the county. had a big problem with spiders, stink bugs & centipedes. this product takes care of them fast and doesn’t cause my wife to have an allergic reaction when i use it indoors. my first one pint bottle lasted 3 years, spraying 6 times a year (once a month for 6 months each year in the warm seasons). highly recommend it for the home do it yerselfer." jon az 08/29/2020 "i am very impressed with this company so far. i came across their videos on youtube and thought they were very informative. i found out about the website and the customer service number/email options. i sent in two emails and they were answered within just a few hours. their answers were very helpful. however, i realized i had additional questions, so i called the phone number on my way home from running errands. i had low expectations (due to a previous interaction with scott's lawn care customer support), so i figured the interaction wouldn't yield much. i couldn't have been more wrong. i spoke to a guy named heath who answered at least 30 questions that i had. he was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. because i was driving i couldn't take notes. when i got home i tried to write down what i remembered and my memory failed me. i called back and spoke to him again. he walked through all the products we discussed a second time. with the same patient, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful advice as the first time. i bought several products and i can't wait to use them. we just moved into a new home about a year ago and found out this summer that our yard was taken over at least 90%+ with weeds. we have a lot of work to do to get rid of the weeds and crab grass, aerate, power seed, and winterize. youtube & google give so much conflicting information, that having a service like what is offered by domyown is fantastic. i can't wait to see the results and post a review for the products - drive xlr8, prime duo select, tenacity, bwi tall fescue grass, etc!" diane woodbine, md 08/24/2020 "ordered on friday morning. arrived at my home on monday at 2pm. folks that is outstanding especially when the shipping is free. my do it yourself life just got better. thanks y'all bobby." bobby prosper, texas the #1 store for diy pest control and lawn & garden solutions our story diy and treatment guidesfrom our experts charitable giving "outstanding service with fast shipping and in supply products, wellpriced and backed up by an excellent company." see more testimonials » ask a pro our expert staff is ready to help. give us a call: 866-581-7378 mon-fri 9am-5pm et contact us customer service for help with your order live chat diy pros available now offline. message us company info about us contact us testimonials charitable giving shipping & returns privacy & security terms of use press room awards affiliates commercial/pro sales my account login register cart order status my lists my autoships shipping & returns shipping return center no hassle returns track your order * free shipping is available to the continental united states only. excludes alaska, hawaii, puerto rico, and all other u.s. territories. helpful links active ingredients ask a pro articles autoship how to videos labels & sds ny pest control list of all pests manufacturers sales & deals diy pest control service kits site map sign up for exclusive money-saving offers stay informed and get connected domyown 4260 communications drive norcross, ga 30093 usa © 2004-2020 p&m solutions, llc dba domyown - all rights reserved
