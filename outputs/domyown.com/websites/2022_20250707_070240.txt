another common herbicide used by the professionals, to get rid of nutsedge and broadleaf weeds, is called sedgehammer. you can ask any professional and they will tell you that there is no better product out there for this kind of weed control. the best weed killer for your lawn will depend on a variety of factors. be sure to read the product labels to know what it will and will not kill, and where you can use the product. these are top two factors you should consider when picking a lawn weed killer: target weeds: identifying and knowing what weeds you need to kill is the first step to picking the best commercial herbicide for your lawn. turf (grass) type: if you are using a selective herbicide, knowing your turf type will help you select an herbicide that will not damage plants or turf you do not wish to kill. if you’re ready to take the guesswork out of weed prevention in your lawn, try our lawn box subscription program. we’ll customize a program for you with pre-emergent weed preventers in the spring, fall or both depending on your turf type, lawn size, and location. see also: fungicide  pest control can't find the product you are looking for? e-mail us and we'll get it for you!
