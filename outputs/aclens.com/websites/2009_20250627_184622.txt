i placed an order with ac lens and was quite prepared to wait 10 -14 days for international priority mail to new zealand, to deliver my order. to my surprise, when i opened my letterbox this morning, there was my order, - six days later! yet again i am impressed with the expedient service. well done ac lens! submitted by deb very satisfied i have to say i used another supplier in the past and your service and price was far better! very fast and accurate. thank you and i will tell my friends! submitted by k clark surpassed my expectations! i am going to be faithful to this company, because they did right by me. both times, i received my lenses fast, and the orders were accurate. the price was even lower than another popular internet lens retailer, who i shall not name. i am very pleased with ac lens! submitted by anonymous customer service is tops i was a little leery about ordering my contacts from an online vendor, but with the great prices that were $10.00 a box cheaper than what my eye doctor charges i couldn't pass it up. my doctor gave me 2 different prescriptions for coloured contacts (i was trying on the demo pairs and then i was going to decide which brand i wanted), well leave it to me to order the wrong ones. well i emailed them and asked them to cancel the order. unfortunately they already went out but when i called and emailed customer service the people i spoke to couldn't be nicer they told me what to do and just reject the first order when fedex came to my door and they would credit me when they received them. the service is super fast!!! i used expedited service which i believe is 3-5 days they came in2 2!!! i am certainly ordering from them again! submitted by liz the best service i've had....anywhere my first experience with ac lens started off roughly. a few days after my first order, online tracking had informed me that my shipment of contacts was delivered. perhaps a neighborhood dog ran off with it or it was delivered to the wrong address, but the package was nowhere to be found. i frantically called the shipping company who was less than helpful. then, i proceeded to call ac lens. after a simple explanation of my dilemma, the customer service representative apologized for the inconvenience and rushed a new order for me. no hassle whatsoever. the order arrived promptly and successfully the second time. i just placed my second order with ac lens two days ago, half expecting that the great service the first time was a fluke. i have already received my contacts. furthermore, the prices here are consistently low. literally, the best shopping experience and customer service i have ever had, anywhere. thanks ac lens! submitted by sarah c this is what i call great service and fast! i am fairly new to contact lens wear and have already ordered from two other on line services for contact lenses and my early experiences left me believing one better order in plenty of time like at least two weeks minimum before one can expect to receive the lenses. i thought maybe one had to expect slow service if the shipping was free but imagine my surprise when i placed my order monday night and here it was wednesday about noon and my lenses are here already! no need to pay the much higher doctors office fee to receive them in one or two days! i am very pleased and will use ac lens for all my future eye care and contact lens needs. submitted by aj i recently ordered some contact lenses from you (former lens.com user) that i needed right away. you were the only site i found that not only had the lenses in stock, but you had the lowest price! your sales people were professional and personable, little or no waiting, and i was treated as if i was your only customer. i got my lenses as promised! thanks! <br><br> now i received an email keeping me up to date in the status of when my lenses will ship! that's what i call customer service! <br><br> i've been recommending you to all of my optically challenged friends,and an especially a skeptical friend has already given you a try. needless to say he was very pleased with your service ("it was easier, less expensive, and i got my lenses faster than going to my eye doctor!) <br><br> i got to say, "i told you so!" thanks! submitted by jimmy i just wanted to let you know that i think you run a fantastic company. i've been ordering my contacts from you for years and, besides offering great prices, reordering is easy and fast, and your customer support is truly amazing. everyone i've dealt with through the years goes above and beyond to ensure that i'm satisfied. i've never had even a neutral experience with you - they are always been positive. submitted by shanna aclens is awesome! i love this place! great prices! great service! submitted by anonymous i wanted to let you know how thrilled i am with the aclens customer service and with the contact lenses that i received yesterday. the communication throughout the entire ordering process was wonderful, and the notifications about shipping were extremely accurate. i couldn't be happier and wanted to let you know. submitted by janet you are fantastic! is there someone i can speak with and/or email to "sing your praises?" i cannot thatnk you enough for doing this! i am currently on hold to place the order, so hopefully this wil all go through today! thanks again. i owe you one -- big time! great service and easy to order and follow through is great. submitted by joan i was leaving on a surf trip and needed contact lens fast. they arrived in plenty of time. thanks ! submitted by brad if you will always provide me with the same service, it's just super buying from you. submitted by jeff thank you for all your advice! you have been the best customer service assistant in any company that i have ever had contact with... submitted by agnes keep up the good work, and customer satisfaction. good job. submitted by donald was very impressed, much more than with 1800contacts, who were very disappointing. submitted by kara i work for a major online catalog company, and see many great aspects on this site as we have available at work, i would (and have) recommended this site to many of my friends! keep up the good work! wouldn't change a thing. submitted by courtney customer service comment just wanted to drop a note to tell you how great i think it is that with literally two clicks i was able to reorder contact lenses and for a great price. what a time and hassle saver. i was not ready to reorder when your email first came through, but i saved it and the links were still live 4 months later. you have a good thing going and i just wanted to say that i appreciate the way you do business. submitted by matt if you are having any unexplained eye discomfort, watering, vision change or redness, remove your lenses immediately and consult your eye care professional before wearing your lenses again. all information, articles, photos, images, logos, and content copyright ac lens 1996 - 2010. customer service ordering contact lenses reordering faq privacy help shipping info order tracking returns corporate info about ac lens contact ac lens press center affiliate program find products sitemap lens catalog accessories glasses reading glasses sunglasses community contact lens blog ac lens on facebook ac lens on twitter ac lens on myspace contact lens forums contact lens coupons contact lens health testimonials
