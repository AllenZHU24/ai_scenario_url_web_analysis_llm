refers to the contact lens prescribed.od: right eye prescriptionos: left eye prescriptionou: prescription is for both eyes back to topadditional information about prescriptionsa contact lens prescription is not the same as an eyeglass prescription. in addition to the lens power, your contact lens prescription contains several other pieces of information related to the size of the lens.your prescription will also contain an expiration date. this is typically one year from the date that the contact lenses were fitted.bc values range from about 8.0 to 9.5. the doctor fits the lens with the curvature most appropriate for your eye. most lenses come in several different bc values. if your prescription does not contain a bc value, this is likely because your brand of lens only comes in one base curve.bc values are a bit like clothes sizes - just because you are a bc 8.6 in one brand doesn't mean you will be in another.if you wear a toric lens your prescription will contain two additional columns entitled cylinder and axis. these numbers are related to the correction of your astigmatism.even the power of the lenses is generally not the same as in your eyeglass prescription. this is because:the contact lens sits on the surface of your eye, while your eyeglasses sit about 12 mm in front of your eyeregular soft contacts do not correct for your astigmatism, but your eye doctor will typically try to partially correct for it by changing the power of the lens.still have questions? email us at: [email protected] back to top learn about lens subscription. opens
