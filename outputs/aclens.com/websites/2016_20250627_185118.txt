shipping can i wear soft contact lenses if i have astigmatism? yes, you can wear a special type of soft contact lens called a toric lens which will correct your astigmatism. can i wear soft contact lenses if i need bifocals? yes, there are a number of contact lenses designed for people who need bifocal (multifocal) correction. is a contact lens prescription different than a glasses prescription? yes. when you order contact lenses, you must have a current contact lens prescription which specifies the power of the lenses, the size of the lens, the type and brand of lens. if my 2 week disposable lenses are still comfortable and in good condition beyond 2 weeks, can i continue to wear the same pair? in order to maintain optimal eye health and comfort, it is important to adhere to the wearing schedule prescribed by your doctor. the main advantage of wearing disposable lenses is that you are putting a fresh new pair of lenses in your eyes every 2 weeks. also, the convenient cleaning regimen of a disposable lens is only adequate for a 2 week wearing schedule. if i only wear my 2 week disposable contacts part time, do i still have to replace them every 2 weeks? no, the 2 weeks refers to the actual amount of wearing time so they can last longer than 2 weeks if you are not wearing them full time. your website lists my lens as 2 week disposable, but my doctor says i can wear them for 4 weeks. which is correct? the lens wearing schedules on our website are provided by contact lens manufacturers. however, doctors may decide on a different wearing schedule (shorter or longer) for an individual patient based on wearing habits, lifestyle, cleaning methods etc. you should always follow the wearing schedule prescribed by your doctor. what's the difference between rigid gas permeable (rgp) lenses and soft lenses? rgps are smaller and made out of a harder, less pliable material than soft lenses which makes them less comfortable initially. rgps correct some astigmatism whereas soft spherical lenses do not. can i swim with my contact lenses in? it is best if you don't because there are bacteria in the water that can adhere to your lenses and cause infections. if you do swim in your lenses, you should wear goggles over them and you should disinfect them immediately afterwards. why is it necessary for contact lens wearers to have regular eye exams even if their prescription hasn't changed? regular eye exams are important not only to check your prescription but also to evaluate the health of your eyes. this is especially important for contact lens wearers because the contacts could be causing damage to your eyes without necessarily causing any obvious symptoms. i wear contact lenses and in order for me to read, i have to wear reading glasses over them. are there any other alternatives whereby i don't have to wear glasses at all? yes, the most common option is called monovision where one eye is corrected for viewing distant objects and the other eye is corrected for reading and close work. monovision is a good solution for some people, but not everybody can successfully adapt to the arrangement. another alternative is bifocal contact lenses which are available in both rigid gas permeable or soft lens designs. do colored contact lenses work on dark eyes? yes, they are called opaque contacts. year-long (daily wear and extended wear) opaque contacts are available in many different colors and shades. there are also several disposable colored lenses for dark eyes including freshlook colors. do i still need a prescription if i just want contacts to change my eye color? yes, you still need to be fitted for the lenses even if you don't need vision correction. this is because contact lenses are medical devices and wearing them can affect the health of your eyes. how does the federal law "fairness to contact lens consumers" act affect me? on february 4th, 2004, a federal law called the "fairness to contact lens consumers" act went into effect. this law made it much easier for you to enjoy the savings and convenience of ordering on-line from ac lens. where is your company headquartered? we are located in columbus, ohio. our location in the center of the usa is ideal for rapid distribution throughout the country. why can't i use a coupon on certain contact lenses? coopervision currently enforces a unilateral pricing policy (upp) which maintains a minimum selling price on certain contact lenses. the new unilateral pricing policy prohibits any u.s. authorized retailer from offering sales, coupons and other discounts that would result in net pricing below the manufacturer's minimum upp price on the lenses listed below. while we continue to sell these contact lenses at the lowest prices possible, we are unable to discount them below the manufacturer's minimum price. how long have you been in business? we have been selling online since 1996. in that time we have served over 500,000 customers located in all 50 states and around the world. how can you offer such low prices on contact lenses? we can offer low pricing because of our large purchasing power. we are able to negotiate the best possible pricing from contact lens manufacturers and distributors. we simply pass those savings along to our customers. how can i be sure i receive email offers and updates from you? you should add service@aclens.com to your whitelist or "friends" to make sure our emails are correctly received. if you change your email address, please take a moment to log-in to your account, and update to the new address. how long does it take for my lenses to arrive? 98% of all us orders arrive within the 7-10 day delivery time stated on our website. however, the vast majority of orders that are shipped from stock will arrive significantly sooner. how do i read my eyeglass prescription? while you don't need to completely understand how to read your eyeglass prescription to place an order on ac lens, you'll need to know the basics in order to select and order the right lenses for your eyes. if you don't have a copy of your prescription, or are not sure how to read it, rest assured that as long as you have your doctor's information we can contact your doctor directly in order to obtain your correct prescription. i want to purchase eyeglasses through ac lens, but this prescription stuff is confusing. is there an easier way? absolutely! you can always leave the prescription fields blank when ordering, and then either send us a copy of your prescription, or give us your eye doctor's contact information and we will collect your prescription information directly; ensuring that your prescription is correct while you remain free of worry! what is the difference between bifocal and progressive bifocal? bifocal eyeglass prescriptions were originally only able to be corrected with lenses called lined bifocals; these types of glasses have a visible line at the point where the prescription changes from near to far vision. progressive bifocals are lenses that have no visible line and gradually change from near to far vision in a way that is easier for your eyes to adjust to. ac lens currently only offers progressive bifocal lenses. unless your prescription notes "bifocal only" or "no progressives", then you can use your bifocal prescription to place an order for progressive bifocal lenses. what if my doctor says i need bifocal correction in only one eye? ac lens is only able to process orders with one type of lens per frame. since a prescription with bifocal correction in only one eye would require a progressive lens in one eye and a single vision lens in the other, we are unable to fulfill these types of orders. we apologize for the inconvenience. my prescription has expired or it doesn't have an expiration date, can i still order glasses? we can only fill orders for unexpired prescriptions. if your prescription does not have an expiration date, then the expiration date is either 1 or 2 years from your exam date, depending on your doctor's preference. we will verify your prescription with your doctor and notify you if the prescription is expired. some doctors offer prescription extensions if your current lenses have broken. we must verify these exceptions through your doctor though. will there be any extra fees for creating my prescription lenses? nope! as long as you selected the correct lens type (single vision vs. progressive bifocal), the cost you see at checkout will be the cost you pay. not all lens requests are guaranteed though. if our lab is unable to create the requested prescription for the selected lens or frame, we will contact you immediately in order to select a lens/frame that works. why does ac lens convert positive (+) cylinder values to negative (-) values? ophthalmologists and a few optometrists (different types of eye doctors), write astigmatism prescriptions with positive (+) cylinders. this is because many years ago the instruments used to measure and cut lenses were only able to do so in positive increments. nowadays the majority of labs, including ours, cut lenses in the negative (-), and require that any positive (+) cylinder prescriptions be converted into the negative (-) equivalent. rest assured this conversion does not alter the type or quality of the vision correction that your doctor prescribed you. the conversion will affect (change) the sph, cyl, and ax parameters in your prescription, but will result in the exact same vision correction you were fit for by your doctor. we automatically perform this conversion if the prescription you enter is written with a positive (+) cylinder. what's the difference between my eyeglasses prescription and contact lens prescription? an eyeglass prescription is not a contact lens prescription, and cannot be used to order contact lenses and vice versa. each prescription contains information that is specific to the type of correction. contact lenses sit directly on the eye whereas glasses are worn on the bridge of the nose. the distance between these two spaces dramatically changes the level of correction for each type. also, not everyone who needs eyeglasses can wear contact lenses. does ac lens accept vision insurance? ac lens does not accept vision insurance as payment for orders, but we do provide a receipt which can be submitted to your insurance company as an out-of-network purchase. make sure you consult with your insurance provider before you place your order to determine whether they reimburse out-of-network purchases and/or whether they have reimbursement limits for out-of-network purchases. does ac lens offer repair services? ac lens does not offer repairs services at this time. please consider visiting a local optical store for assistance with repair requests. does ac lens sell replacement parts? ac lens does not sell replacement parts. you can check with your local eye doctor to see if they can assist you with replacement parts, or you can contact the manufacturer directly to find out where their replacement parts are sold. can ac lens make lenses for my existing frames? ac lens does not currently offer lenses-only orders for frames that were not originally purchased through ac lens. but, if you are looking to replace the lenses in a pair of eyeglasses that you purchased through ac lens you can contact our customer service department to set up a lens remake order. please note: this process will require you to mail-in your existing frames, though we will provide you with free return postage. what happens if my doctor changes my prescription after i receive my glasses? if your doctor changes your prescription due to vision problems you are experiencing with your recent glasses purchase, we will replace your lenses one time for free. you must return the frames to us within 30 days from the delivery date. the replacement lenses will be made with the same lens material and treatments that were previously selected, and will require you to mail-in your existing frames, though we will provide you with free return postage. what are the best lenses for my prescription? for the most part, selecting a lens material has to do with preference, but some lens materials and treatments are better for certain lifestyles and prescriptions. lens material: cr-39 plastic best for: back-up glasses reason: affordable lens material: polycarbonate best for: children / active lifestyles / sports reason: impact resistant and lightweight lens material: hi-index 1.67 best for: long-term everyday wear / high sph prescriptions (+/- 6.00 to any) reason: thin lens treatment: anti-glare coating best for: progressive prescriptions / sph prescriptions over +/- 2.00 reason: these prescription types are prone to glare does ac lens sell prescription sunglasses or transitions®? yes—we offer transitions® lenses, as well as single vision prescription sunglasses. do i get a case or cleaning cloth with my glasses? some manufacturers provide custom eyeglass cases and cloths with their frames. any frames that do not come with custom cases or cloths will be shipped with a basic case and cleaning cloth free of charge. how do i know my prescription will be correct? in order to make sure you receive your glasses with the correct prescription we will always contact your doctor directly to confirm your prescription. you can rest assured that what you are prescribed will be what you receive. our lab has over 50 years of experience with creating lenses, and all lenses are double checked by an optical specialist immediately prior to shipment. how do progressive lenses work? progressive lenses provide bifocal vision correction, but with no visible lines! lined bifocals have a distinct line or etch in the lens which visibly indicates where the lens switches from reading to distance vision. progressive lenses are able to complete the transition between the vision corrections smoothly; letting your eyes naturally move between reading and distance vision without the distracting line in your lenses. what are uv rays? ultraviolet rays are rays located beyond the visible spectrum. uv rays are categorized into three types: uva, uvb, and uvc. - uva: most common throughout the year. these rays pass through glass so the can be harmful both indoors and outdoors. - uvb: the most dangerous type of uv rays and the primary cause of skin burning and retina harm. rays do not pass through glass. - uvc: blocked by the earth's ozone layer and do not reach the earth's surface. can i buy prescription sunglasses? yes! we offer single vision prescription sunglasses. what are polarized lenses? polarized lenses contain a special filter that reduces glare. these lenses are very popular amongst people who enjoy the outdoors, especially watersports. how do i clean sunglasses? sunglasses should be cleaned using a lint-free, non-abrasive cloth. we recommend using a lens cleaner as well. do i need to wear sunglasses on a cloudy day? uv rays still permeate through clouds and can still cause damage to your eyes. it is recommended you wear protective eyewear on both sunny and cloudy days. do mirrored lenses offer better uv protection than standard lenses? no. mirrored lenses are coated with a metallic coating that is partially reflective. mirrored lenses are good for sports and driving where glare is an issue. what are photochromic lenses? this type of lens automatically darkens and lightens in direct response to sunlight. with this convenient feature, this lens enables you to wear one pair of eyeglasses without having to switch between prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses. they are also great for kids who spend a lot of their time outdoors. are sunglasses safe to wear for sports? yes. sunglasses frames and lenses are required to be shatter proof by the fda. they provide safety from the sun and act as protective eyewear as well.
