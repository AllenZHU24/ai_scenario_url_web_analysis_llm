work to ensure that these third-party adware services do not function on the 1-800 contacts website, www.1800contacts.com. spyware is also software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, record and transmit information regarding the websites you visit, or record or transmit your keystrokes to a third party. spyware, like adware, is often installed without the knowledge of the
