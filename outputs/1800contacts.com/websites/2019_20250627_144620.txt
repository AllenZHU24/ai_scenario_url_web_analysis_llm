how to get a contact lens prescription - eye society buy contacts eye society categories contacts vision community buzz search for: how to get a contact lens prescription when considering purchasing contact lenses online, the first step is a visit to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. here’s what to expect. before the exam generally, a visit to the eye doctor includes an eye exam, a fitting, and a prescription. when you intend to use your prescription to shop elsewhere, there are a few questions and concerns you should address in advance. before your exam, ask the doctor if they will prescribe a national brand. some doctors will only prescribe private label lenses that are not available anywhere but from them. contact lens prescriptions are brand specific and cannot be substituted. national brands are available to be purchased anywhere, so requesting this in advance will make it easier to fill your prescription later. doctors are legally required to provide a written copy of your prescription upon request. be sure to ask for a copy each time you have an eye exam. eye exam & fitting once you have established that your doctor will prescribe a well-known brand, you will need an eye exam and a contact lens fitting. contacts come in a variety of sizes, and the doctor will need to measure your eyes to get the right fit. the size will also depend on the type of lenses you want. the most common are soft lenses and rgp,or rigid gas permeable lenses (read our rgp article here). your doctor should go over your lens options with you and help you determine which will best meet your needs. if you already wear contacts, but would like to try a different brand, it is best to have a new eye exam so you can be fitted for that brand. cosmetic contacts contact lenses are prescription medical devices. even if you just want to purchase cosmetic contact lenses that change your eye color, you will still need an eye exam and a prescription from an eye doctor. the same applies to costume or theatrical contact lenses. however, you may not need a vision test to get a prescription for this type of lens – ask your eye care provider about their policy. can i use my glasses prescription for contacts?
