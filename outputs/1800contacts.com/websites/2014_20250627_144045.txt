(click here for more on this topic) can the doctor charge me for a copy of my prescription? some doctors may try to charge you for a copy of your prescription either after your examination or when you are attempting to order from a contact lens retailer. this practice is illegal, as charging patients for copies of their contact lens prescription is not permitted under federal law. (click here for more on this topic) is it the same as my eyeglass prescription? prescriptions for contact lenses and eyeglasses are different. a contact lens prescription contains information not found in a prescription for eyeglasses, like brand, base curve and diameter. if you have a prescription for eyeglasses but want to try contacts, visit your eye care provider for a contact lens fitting. before your exam, be sure to tell your eye care provider you will need a copy of your contact lens prescription. follow us s other articles 24 reuses for contact lens cases 7 signs your child may have a vision problem keratitis and the dangers of overwearing contacts what is upp? colored contact lenses contact lenses for dry eyes gas permeable contact lenses disposable contact lenses lens wear and care tips protect your eyes from uv rays why are my lenses blurry? contact lenses and allergies how to get your rx contact lens technology guide to eye health exams are contact lenses right for you? understanding colorblindness a history of contact lenses the rx eye care terms rx verification info the doctor the rx when the doc says "no" doctor wants to charge for my rx fclcalegislative efforts the fclca becomes law recent posts another reason to never run out of contacts never run out of contacts ask dr. clay: should i wear decorative contact lenses with my halloween costume? listen to our streaming radio commercials brian bethers, ceo of 1-800 contacts, accepts the als ice bucket challenge company information our commitment 20/20 guarantee vision 101 the eye how the eye works common visual problems lens fundamentals wearing contacts our story our company public relations corporate contacts company accolades community privacy policy featured articles contact lenses for dry eyes colored contact lenses contact lens technology are contact lenses right for you? your stories customer testimonials customer fanmail common questions (faq) connect special eyes blog press releases connect sitemap shop contacts our commitment – at 1-800 contacts, we are dedicated to providing you with a simple, fast, and hassle-free way to order your contact lenses. when you buy contact lenses from us you'll find: 20/20 guarantee – at 1-800 contacts, your satisfaction is guaranteed. if you're not pleased with your order, we'll make it right. we'll even exchange unopened boxes of previously purchased contact lenses if your prescription changes. the highest quality contact lenses – we maintain the world's largest inventory of contact lenses – almost 10 million. no one is more likely to have your contact lens brand in stock and ready to ship. you'll get the same contact lenses your eye care professional prescribes, but at discount prices and delivered to your door. we offer all of the major brands like acuvue, air optix, biofinity, focus, freshlook, proclear, purevision, and soflens, as well as specialty toric contact lenses, colored contacts, and bifocal lenses. you can order with confidence – as the world's largest contact lens store®, 1-800 contacts has filled more than 16 million orders for more than 5 million customers. to ensure you get the exact contact lenses you need, we'll verify your prescription with your doctor before shipping your contact lenses right to your door. plus, our customers get unbeatable savings when they take advantage of our discount prices and exclusive contact lens special offers. every order is backed by our 20/20 guarantee at 1-800 contacts, we know that the last thing you need is something else to worry about. that's why we make getting your contacts easy, and then back up every order with our 20/20 guarantee. that means that if you are dissatisfied for any reason, we'll make it right. each of our customers enjoy: live customer service support by chat, email, or phone available 24/7 to address your needs. free exchanges of unopened boxes of previously purchased contact lenses if your prescription changes. free replacement of torn contact lenses. learn more the material provided on this site is for informational purposes only. have your eyes examined regularly and always follow your eye care professional's instructions for the proper use and care of your contact lenses. if you experience pain or discomfort from your contact lens, discontinue use immediately and consult your eye care professional. all discounts and promotions are applied to future purchases only and cannot be applied to past purchases. © 1-800 contacts, all rights reserved
