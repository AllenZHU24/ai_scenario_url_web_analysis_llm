strive to manage your personal information with the utmost care. this policy applies to customer information obtained by 1800mattress in connection with its operations online.  this policy describes: how and why we collect your personal information. how your information is used and protected. when and with whom we share your information. the choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information. why we collect information we collect personal information about you to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience. we strive to limit the amount of personal information collected to support the intended purpose of the collection.  for example, if you order a product, we need to have information such as your billing address, age, product choice, delivery information, and payment processing information.  in addition, your personal information helps us communicate with you about our latest products, special offers, and information and events about which you might like to hear.  we also collect your personal information to help us design and deliver our website, and to delivery targeted advertisements to you when you use the website.  when we use the term “aggregate” information it means, generally, that we may combine information obtained from you together with information from other sources, which may help us develop a more targeted user profile concerning you and/or your demographic information.  for example, if you provide us with your email address, we may cross-check that address against information that might be otherwise available through other entities with whom we have business relationships in order to develop a more in-depth demographic profile of you. what information we collect we collect
