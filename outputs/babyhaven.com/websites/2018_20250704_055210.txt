great for travel, running those quickie errands or maneuvering in tight ... spaces. they are not recommended for babies under 6 months who are not able to support their head, neck and back on there own, unless there is fully-reclining seat or it is able to accommodate an infant car seat -- which many do not. many umbrella strollers don’t offer all the same luxuries as standard full-feature models; so they might not always be the best option for long outings with baby. this doesn’t mean, however, that you can’t get an umbrella stroller without all the desired features. brands like maclaren, zooper, combi and peg perego have added in many extra features to their design, so both parents and babies will be more comfortable. the maclaren techno xt, zooper twist and maclaren triumph, for example, have become favorite picks of many parents. lightweight strollers are another favorite pick among parents looking for something that is portable, easy to maneuver and convenient. lightweight designs average about 12 pounds, but some ultra-lightweight designs can weigh as little as 5 pounds. these are often synonymous with the umbrella stroller; however, not all lightweight strollers will have that characteristic umbrella-like design with two separate j-shaped handles which makes it a true umbrella stroller. following such, many lightweight strollers are also not suitable for infants under 6 months unless they feature a full-recline seat or are able to accommodate an infant car seat. with brands such as bugaboo, combi, chicco, cosco, kolcraft, zooper and maclaren, you’ll be able to find an extensive selection of lightweight designs at babyhaven. are you an active parent, looking to stay active even though you’ve got a new addition to the family? then you might want to consider one of our many jogging strollers from brands such as: baby trend, bob, baby jogger, instep and schwinn. with all terrain-tires, superior suspension, quality safety harnesses and sleek designs, joggers are fast becoming favorites among many parent -- from intense runners to those parents who love to cruise around the mall. there are many joggers that are also compatible with infant car seats, and although it is not recommended to jog with an infant until at least 6 months of age, the jogger can be used as a sleek, sporty walking stroller for baby’s first months. maybe you prefer biking to jogging? if so, you might want to consider one of babyhaven’s many bicycle trailers from brands such as: instep, schwinn, chariot and burley. many of our bicycle trailers will also convert into walking strollers, jogging strollers or even cross-country skiing trailers to satisfy the needs of any outdoor enthusiast. if you’re looking to stroll your newborn around in style, then a baby pram or carriage might be the way to go. designed with infants in mind, prams and carriages feature generous sized bassinettes so infants can lay down and have their heads and necks supported. prams and carriages boast an old-english feel with large wheels, elegant designs and generous sun shades to protect baby from the elements. prams and carriages from brands like inglesina, bugaboo and micralite offer your newborn unparalleled luxury and comfort. prams and carriages are built to last, but the bassinettes aren’t designed to accommodate babies that are over 6 months. you might find that you will just not get enough use out of a traditional pram or carriage. there are, however, many brands like bugaboo and micralite, who are designing their prams and carriages to be easily converted in strollers for older babies and toddlers. the travel system is a relatively new advancement in the stroller industry that has become a favorite choice among many parents. featuring a stroller, coordinating car seat and a car seat base, a travel system is that all-in-one package that will get you and your baby all the way through their toddler years. with a travel system, you can transport baby from the car and attach the car seat to the stroller without ever having to wake baby. when baby is too big for their infant car seat, the travel system can just be used as a standard stroller. many top brands have jumped on board with this relatively new and convenient travel system concept. at babyhaven you can find travel systems from: graco, baby trend, combi, chicco, peg perego and more. a sit and stand stroller is also a wonderful option for parents looking for a stroller that will accommodate children of various ages. the sit and stand is perfect for parents with a young baby and a toddler. featuring a front seat that accommodates an infant car seat and a back jumper seat / standing board, the sit and stand, will allow an infant to rest comfortably in the front while your toddler can choose to sit or stand in the back. your older child will love the freedom they get from choosing their seating position. if you are interested in a sit and stand, check out our line of sit and strand strollers such as the baby trend sit n stand plus, sit n stand lx and the joovy caboose. if you’re looking for a stroller that gives new meaning to the phrase “added features”, a standard stroller might be just the stroller for you. at babyhaven, we stock a large selection of standard strollers from brands such as: zooper, graco, peg perego, kolcraft, combi and many more. featuring a multi-position “memory recline” seat, all-wheel suspension, shopping basket, 3-position leg rest and more, the chicco cortina is a full-featured stroller with style and charm. standard styles tend to be a little bit larger and take up more space, but many parents find that the comfort provided by those extra features can be well worth it. not all parents are ready to make a commitment to a stroller in the very early stages. some parents need more time to decide, and other parents don’t want to hassle with purchasing a larger, or more expensive, stroller that will accommodate an infant car seat. if you’re not ready for such a purchase, but you need something to help you get through baby’s first months, consider one of babyhaven’s stroller frame car seat carriers. the baby trend snap n go, for example, is a frame that turns your infant car seat into a convenient stroller. the baby trend snap n go isn’t the only car seat carrier of its kind; many other brands such as graco, kolcraft and maclaren make similar car seat carriers that are reasonably priced, compact and great options for infants. have you found that perfect stroller, but you’re looking to spice things up a bit? add a new dimension to your stroller with stroller accessories from babyhaven. we carry everything from head supports and strap covers, to cup holders and stroller organizers, to rain covers and footmuffs. our selection of travel bags such as the jl childress gate check bag and jl childress standard and dual stroller bag will help make travel time with baby’s stroller easy and convenient. with our selection of accessories, you’ll be able to find something for every occasion imaginable. sometimes, having the right accessories will make a world of difference. we know that your options may seem overwhelming, but with our easy category search and advanced search options, you can narrow down your choices based on your specifications until you find the perfect stroller. read more strollers category double and triple strollers(8) jogging strollers (1) lightweight strollers(10) full-size strollers(8) stroller
