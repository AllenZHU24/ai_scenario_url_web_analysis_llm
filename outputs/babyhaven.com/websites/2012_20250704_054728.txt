safety is no easy task. anywhere baby goes in the home will have to be baby proofed – starting of course with the nursery. nursery safety is paramount ... because baby will be spending a good amount of time there. sleep positioners, crib wedges and wearable blankets will help baby sleep safely through the night. for those times when you can’t be right by baby’s side, a baby monitor will help you keep tabs on your little one. high quality audio baby monitors and video baby monitors from companies such as summer infant and graco will help you monitor baby form anywhere in the house. for example, the summer infant complete coverage video monitor set has a unique look, tilt feature and swivel design that accommodates multiple viewing angles for the most comprehensive baby monitoring available. featuring a 7” lcd color flat screen and 1.8” color handheld unit, you’ll be able to see and hear baby crystal clear at a distance of up to 350 feet away! with the summer infant complete coverage video monitor set, you’ll feel as if you never left baby’s side. take baby’s sleep safety to a new level with an infant movement monitor such as the babysense v infant movement monitor. dubbed the “original” infant movement monitor, the babysense v utilizes sensitive sensor pads that are placed under baby’s mattress, constantly monitoring and detecting even the slightest movements. if baby’s movement stops, is irregular or slow, the babysense v alerts you with an alarm after 20 seconds. with the alarm warning, parents can come to the aid of baby. you’ve got a lot of child proofing to do around the house with the arrival of baby. from the kitchen to the bathroom, you’re going to have to incorporate home safety products such as electrical outlet caps, cabinet and drawer locks and door knob locks. in the kitchen, you’ll probably want a stove guard to protect baby from hot stovetop hazards. oven knob covers and appliance locks are also helpful for keeping baby out of trouble. don’t forget to get a toilet lock, spout cover and bathtub mats for the bathroom. well, were on the subject of child proofing the home, if you’ve got easily accessible windows, a window guard, window lock or window wedge will help keep baby out of any trouble. also, don’t forget that those blind cords need to be stored out of reach of your child. products like mommy’s helper cord-wind ups and kidco’s blindwinders will keep those long blind cords safely contained out of baby’s reach. one of the ultimate child proofing essentials is the baby gate. designed for virtually any space, baby gates are used to keep children out of those off-limits spaces. from the hardware mounted baby gates for the top of the stairs to the pressure mounted baby gates for the bottom of the stairs, we have an extensive selection of safety gates for every place in the home. parents will feel safer and baby will be safer with a safety gate from babyhaven. don’t let baby’s safety take a back seat, just because you’re leaving the home. baby travel safety is just as crucial as home safety. for example, child locators and child harnesses are perfect travel safety accessories. you won’t loose track of your little one when you’ve got a child harness or child locator. you can even try out some bug and insect netting for baby’s stroller, playpen or car seat to keep them safe from pesky, biting critters. trust us, baby will thank you. from the home to travel time, baby’s safety is always the top priority. baby safety can be an overwhelming field to tackle, but when you shop at
