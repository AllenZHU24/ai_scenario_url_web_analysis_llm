ride in a rear-facing car seat until they are one year of age and ... weigh at least 20 pounds. if your child fits this description, you’ve got a couple routes to go – an infant car seat or a convertible car seat. for smaller babies, an infant car seat is usually the preferred alternative. designed specifically for infants, they are smaller and will usually be a better fit for an infant. with these models, you will also find that many are compatible with strollers -- forming what is known as a travel system. convenient stay-in-car bases are also a standard feature with infant car seats which allows for the car seat to simply be snapped in and out of the car seat base, so baby will not have to be transferred in and out of their car seat. the graco snugride and baby trend flex loc are a few examples of parent favored infant seats. the disadvantage to the standard infant car seat which might have you turning in the direction of the convertible car seat is the lower weight capacity. most infant models only accommodate babies up to approximately 22 pounds; although, weight capacity will vary based on model and manufacturer. a convertible car seat is unique in that it can be used in the rear-facing position for infants and simply turned around in a forward-facing position for older children. the weight capacity of a convertible model is higher than that of an infant model. the rear-facing weight capacity is also greater (usually about 35 pounds). this is important because it allows your child to stay rear-facing for a longer time, as recommended by the american academy of pediatrics. subsequently, when your child outgrows the rear-facing capacity, the car seat can be turned around and used as a standard toddler car seat. many parents looking for a car seat that will get their child through their toddler years will turn to a convertible car seat. even for parents that start out with an infant car seat, however, will look into purchasing a convertible as a second car seat for their child once they outgrow their infant one. if that is what you plan on doing, you’ll be able to keep your child rear-facing longer, and then flip the seat around when they’re bigger and use it as a toddler car seat. to get a better idea about the convertible models available today, you might want to consider taking a look at the evenflo advance lx or the true fit convertible car seat from the first years. if you’ve started out with an infant car seat and baby has outgrown it, you can either get a convertible car seat as mentioned or jump straight into a toddler car seat. there aren’t a whole lot of standard forward-facing toddler car seats available on the market. many of these toddler models are designed as combination car seats which many parents applaud. a combination seat converts from a forward-facing toddler car seat to a booster seat. the graco nautilus 3-in-1 is the perfect example of a versatile combination seat, and as such, it is probably the only front-facing car seat you would ever need to purchase. with the graco nautilus your child can use the 5-point safety harness in a front-facing position up to 65 pounds. after your child reaches this mark, the nautilus can be converted into a highback booster and then a backless booster able to accommodate children up to 100 pounds. the american academy of pediatrics recommends using a 5-point safety harness with your child as long as possible, and many of these combination toddler seats, such as the nautilus, are supporting increasingly higher weight limits for use with their integrated 5-point safety harnesses. with the purchase of a combination toddler seat, you will also eliminate the need to make future booster seat purchases as your child grows. if you’re in the market for a booster seat for an older child, there are a few things you need to consider. unlike standard car seats, a booster seat utilizes the seat belts in your vehicle. to use a booster seat, your vehicle must have a lap and shoulder belt – a single lap belt is not sufficient. once your child has completely outgrown their toddler car seat and is ready for a booster seat, you have a couple options to choose from. if you have already purchased a combination seat such as the graco nautilus, you can simply convert it into a booster seat for your child. if not, you can purchase booster seats separately. there are two types of boosters that you can choose between – highback and backless. if your car has low back seats or inadequate headrests in the back, you’ll probably want to consider a highback booster seat. highback boosters such as the evenflo big kid and the graco highback turbobooster feature supportive headrests and are adjustable to meet the needs of your growing child. your other booster option is the backless, and if your car has high back seats and good headrests in the back, this option is no less safe than the highback models. some parents prefer the backless models because they are often lighter, less bulky and easier to transport between cars if needed. if you’re considering a backless booster and want to know where to start, take a look at the cobmi dakota backless booster or the graco backless turbobooster. once you’ve got your child’s car seat, it’s time for the car seat accessories! with the right travel accessories for your car seat, road trips and travel will be much more comfortable and convenient for everyone involved. at babyhaven, we have an extensive selection of accessories for any occasion. from additional bases and protective mats, to travel bags and car seat carriers, to head supports and cushioned strap covers, you’ll find everything you need to add comfort and convenience to your travels. whether you’re looking for the perfect car seat or the perfect accessories, babyhaven is your one-stop shop. read more car seats category booster car seats(3) car seat accessories(48) convertible car seats(8) infant
