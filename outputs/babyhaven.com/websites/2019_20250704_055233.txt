that offer international shipping options. we strive to ship every product we can to any country in the world. although we would love to be able to ship all of our products across the us border, sometimes a certain product does not meet our requirements and therefore will not be allowed to ship outside of the united states. to see if a certain item is eligible for international shipping you must add it to the cart. babyhaven.com always selects the most cost effective and reliable carrier for your order. typically, we ship your order via fedex ground, but some orders are shipped via ups, usps, or even white-glove service. our standard ground shipping prices for orders within the 48 continental united states are as follows: up to $25 = $6.49 $25 to $99.99 = $4.99 $100 or over = free all in stock items will be shipped the same business day if ordered by 5 pm est. orders shipped directly from the manufacturer typically take 1 to 3 business days to ship. on the item detail page it will give the approximate handling time for each item under the add to cart button. all international buyers are responsible for their country's incoming duties or tariffs charged to import your order. the declared value will always be the amount that you paid for your order. duties and tariffs are to be paid to your own country and not to babyhaven.com. all duties and tariffs are in addition to any charges by babyhaven.com. us buyers are given multiple shipping choices for each in stock item that they order. usually they are: 1 business day, 2 business days, 3 business days, and 1 to 7 business days babyhaven.com will ship your order based on your shipping selection. we will use whatever shipping carrier and service that we deem to accommodate your time constraints. choosing 1 business day does not guarantee that we will ship your order via overnight express service. since we have multiple warehouses across the united states we can s ometimes get your order to you within your time constraints without shipping your order via an express service. shipping policy about us privacy policy frequently asked questions quantity discount return policy shipping policy terms and
