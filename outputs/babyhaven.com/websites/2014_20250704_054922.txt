not only does it provide stimulation for healthy suction when feeding, but it also comes with an adorable stuffed animal on the end. this can provide extra soothing effects compared to just using the pacifier alone. it connects right to the pacifier, so you do not have to worry about baby rolling over on it or putting the animal in their mouth. read more posted in feeding by babyhaven mommy
