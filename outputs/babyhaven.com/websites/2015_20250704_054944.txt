little one will always enjoy baby toys—the use of ... baby toys can help your bundle of joy learn and explore the world around them, one step at a time. as your child gets older, they will graduate from baby toys to other toys made for toddlers and preschoolers. once they’ve graduated from baby toys such as plush toys, baby teethers, and rattles, you will find that they will enjoy a great activity toy, like toys from leap frog and anatex. these activity tables, wall panels, and sets will keep your baby entertained for hours on end, helping them educate themselves about their surroundings, and even give them a jump start on their colors, numbers, and letters! over time, your baby will enjoy ride-on toys, like tricycles and wagons, and will take great joy in playing in the sand in the sandbox. they may even take a liking to a more creative toy, such as a musical instrument or even some arts and craft toys. they can play a miniature piano made just for their size, or they can enjoy finger painting or drawing on a sturdy, high-quality easel. our store also offers a number of educational toys, which can help your preschooler get ready for school! from number puzzles to maze games, our educational toys will entertain your child in the tub, in the crib, or even in the car seat or stroller. learning on the go is the best way to teach your baby colors, numbers, letters and more! there are a number of baby toys on the market, so its important to find out which ones your baby is attracted to and what they are interested in—that way, you know you’ll be investing in a toy that will give your child hours of entertainment and keep them engaged and intent on learning over the years! many baby toys will “grow” with your child, and will offer years of entertainment, instead of months like some teethers, rattles, and other baby toys that you typically find in department and specialty stores. remember, playing is learning—stock up on some great baby toys to give your child the edge in their early years! narrow results shopping options category bath toys (26) sports and outdoor toys (14) pretend play (39) ride-on and push toys (6) infant toys (94)
