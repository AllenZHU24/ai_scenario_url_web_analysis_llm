easier to take it room by room. let’s take a look at the bathroom. the bathroom is one of the most potentially dangerous rooms in the home; so proper baby bathroom safety is absolutely essential. to keep little hands, faces and toys out of the toilet, a quality toilet lock will be all that you need. toilet locks from mommy’s helper, kidco and safety 1st will keep children and your plumbing safe. moving on to the bathtub, a bath spout guard will help protect baby during their bath. bath thermometers or temperature sensors will ensure that baby’s bath is never too hot or too cold – but just right. when the bath gets a little slippery, padded bath cushions, floor mats and bathtub grips will help prevent nasty slip and falls. once you get to the kitchen, you’ll be faced with a whole new set of safety challenges. help keep baby protected from the heat of the kitchen with stove guards such as those from prince lionheart. stove guards form the perfect barrier between children and hot stovetops. throw in some stove knob covers, oven lock and multi-functional appliance locks and you’ll be well on your way to kitchen safety. heading over to the family room, it looks like you’ve got a bunch of furniture to baby proof. you might want to start with some padded corner guards from kidco, kidkusion or safety 1st to protect baby from those sharp furniture corners. once, you’ve got your corners covered, edge guards will pad around the rest of those hard edges that baby could get hurt on. the kidkusion edge kushions, for example, feature soft foam padding that attach easily with double sided adhesive to tables, counters, cabinets, dressers and more. you’ll feel safer, and baby will be safer, when you’ve got your edges and corners covered! if you’ve got a little climber on your hands, you’re going to want to make sure that all your furniture is secured. from the furniture in your child’s room to the living room furniture, furniture brackets and anti-tip straps will keep all those large pieces from tipping. for all those windows, window wedges, stops and guards will keep your little one safe from potential falls. windows can be extremely dangerous, but the blinds can be just as dangerous for baby. you’ll want to keep those blind cords out of reach of your child at all times. blindwinders from kidco and cord wind-ups from mommy’s helper will contain long blind cords and store them high above your child’s reach. as you move around the house, it’s a good idea to discover which drawers and cabinets need to be off-limits. let’s keep those off-limit areas off-limits with cabinet and drawer safety locks and latches. kidco’s adhesive magnet locks and keys utilize magnetic technology to keep drawers and cabinets securely closed until parent’s use the key. whether you don’t want baby pinching their fingers in the drawers or finding dangerous items in your cabinets, cabinet and drawer safety locks will help you keep your little ones out of trouble. of course, the doors are just as much of a safety concern. when you get to the front door, try out a door knob or door lever lock from kidco, mommy’s helper or safety 1st. after all, we can’t have baby wandering out of the house unattended. a dominant safety concern that lingers throughout the entire home is electrical safety. as parents know, you’ve got to keep curious little children from inserting things into electrical outlets. it’s best to cover up any unused electrical outlets with outlet caps or covers. you don’t want baby getting the “shock” of their life; so make sure those electrical outlets are covered up. it would be easier if child proofing ended with the house; however, it sure doesn’t stop there. baby’s outdoor safety is just as essential. if you want to keep your child in the yard, set up boundaries with deck or driveway guards from kidkusion. if you’re out-and-about, maximize child safety with child safety harnesses and child locators. with safety harnesses and child locators, you’ll always have watch over your child. no matter what you need to make baby safe, we’ve got just the right products for you. when baby’s safety is the priority, we’ll help you through. read more childproofing category bathroom safety(29) child safety locks(71) door and banister safety(17) electrical safety(29) furniture safety(31) kitchen safety(18) outdoor safety(30)
