care health products. thermometers, nasal aspirators and medicine dispensers are indispensible health products for any ... parent. a thermometer is the first thing you will reach for when you think baby’s come down with something. we know, however, that baby isn’t always thrilled with their thermometer. fortunately, there are many new innovative thermometers designed with baby’s comfort in mind. take for instance the summer infant pacifier thermometer. designed like a pacifier, baby won’t put up a fuss when you take their temperature with the summer infant pacifier thermometer. we can’t talk about baby’s health without stressing the importance of a health kit or a first aid kit. for those unavoidable owies, you’re going to need a way to nurse baby back to health. this is where a first aid kit can be a lifesaver for both parents and babies. for example, the me4kidz medibag incorporates all of the most essential baby first aid elements into one convenient kit for use at home or on-the-go. the award-winning medibag has taken a truly kid-friendly approach to first aid that will help keep that smile on your little one’s face. although you might not be able to keep baby from getting sick once in awhile, there are many baby hygiene and baby care products that will help you keep your little one as healthy as possible. baby oral care, for example, is an area that shouldn’t be taken lightly. it’s important to instill good brushing habits in your child’s daily routine. from the time their very first tooth begins to emerge, and even before, cleaning and brushing teeth and gums are important for maintaining health. a baby friendly, soft-bristle toothbrush such as the baby buddy baby’s 1st toothbrush will help your little one learn good brushing habits while the bristles will help to massage their sore gums. baby hygiene continues with baby shampoos, nail clippers, brushes, combs and a slue of other grooming products that you’ll discover. diapering is also an important part of maintaining baby’s hygiene. baby will go through diapers at an unimaginable rate; so you’re going to have to make sure that you’ve always got a fresh diaper ready for baby. whether you’re going the disposable route or you’re leaning toward the eco-friendly cloth diaper, the proper diapers and diaper accessories will help keep baby healthy and happy. sometimes it’s when you’re out-and-about that you really need to watch out for baby’s health. after all, you really don’t know what germs linger in those public spaces that you take baby to. that’s why, many companies have made a conscious effort to develop baby health care products that will protect baby from germs when your on-the-go. one of the most popular means of on-the-go protection is the shopping cart cover. shopping cart covers cover shopping cart seats and handles so that baby will have a comfy, germ-free place to sit while you take them shopping. we know that you do your best to protect baby and keep them healthy. babyhaven is only here to lend you a helping hand when it comes to finding all the baby health care essentials that you need to keep baby smiling. narrow results shopping options
