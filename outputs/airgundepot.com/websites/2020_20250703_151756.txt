they developed the inertia driven magazine. most airgun mags are spring-driven with a physical top that holds the pellet in line for the pellet pusher. if you kick that pellet out of the way, the mag automatically just rotates to the next pellet. that’s where the double feeding can happen. the new inertia driven mag does things differently. it senses the shot recoil and only then rotates to the next pellet in line. this way, if you were to accidentally cock the gun again, you don’t get the double feed. it’s a great solution that solves a problem in the market. portable hpa air the barrier to entry for pcp airguns has always been the need to fill them. it’s always been expensive, and compressors have been bulky and heavy. while we’ve seen significant improvements in portability, there has still been the issue of longevity. compressors get hot, very hot. this creates a lot of wear on the internals, making them prone to failure. companies have been working on ways around this problem, but that just made things bulkier, heavier, and less portable. enter “smart” compressors. this year we’ve seen at least two smart compressors enter the market. we’re not referring to compressors with auto-shutoff, as that’s not really “smart,” it’s just a mechanical (or electronic) switch that turns off the power when a preset pressure is reached. we are talking about computer-controlled compressors that sense the heat inside the system and take measures to prevent overheating and equipment failure. that may be slowing down or changing how it’s running, to automatically shutting down until the unit cools down, and then restarting to finish the fillup. the new readyair by umarex usa is an example, as is the new hill ec-3000 compressor. the readyair is not only smart but very affordable. it’s oilless, waterless, and knows when to shut down when temps get too hot. the fans stay running until the unit reaches a safe temp. from there, you can restart the fill process. you can do this as many times as needed until full. it’s also user-serviceable, allowing end-users to easily maintain it for years to come. it runs on both 12v and 110v, making it an excellent option for home or field use. the air venturi hill compressor is more expensive, but it’s also smarter. it does require oil, but even that is smart. the oil reservoirs are easily accessed, and the computer system asks you each startup if they are at the right level. it counts it’s hours and tells you when it needs an oil change. when it gets too hot, it pauses to cool down and then automatically starts up again. it’s built like a tank, exceptionally quiet, and just looks cool also. summing up those are just a few of the new innovations we’ve seen in 2020. some honorable mentions are the massive big bore guns like the hatsan piledriver and the air force texan carbon fiber, affordable airguns with high-end features like the air venturi avenger, and the list could just keep going. the bottom line is that we are seeing regular advances in airgun technology all the time. things just keep getting better and better for airgunners. browse other articles. share with your friends « gun or glass, part 1 • gun or glass, part 2 » please enable javascript to view and engage in comments. the year 2020 will go down in history for many reasons. probably none of them will be airgun related, but that does not mean that we didn’t see some great tech come out this year. let’s take a look at a few things that have improved airgunning here in 2020. power plant combo the top […] categoriesarticles definitive guides videos top 5 under pressure trophy wall stranger guns resources hunting head to head reviews follow us recent posts picking the best airgun ammo what’s a plinking rifle?
