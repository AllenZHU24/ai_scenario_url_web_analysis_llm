power depends on velocity and the weight of the pellet. we've touched upon caliber and power, but it's also important to consider the powerplant, in other words, the part of the gun that controls the air. break barrels are usually the best compromise between cost, power, and convenience, but they can require a bit of a learning curve to shoot them well. co2 cartridges are cheap and convenient but don't provide a lot of power nor do they work in cold weather, while pre-charged pneumatics (pcps) can be very powerful and accurate but require an external air source. regardless of your skill level or intended purposes, we have the options you need when shopping for air rifles. pick up a high-powered option today for varmint hunting, small pest control or just plinking in the backyard. no matter what you are looking for, you will find the right gun at the right price here at airgun depot. shop our large selection of air rifles, pellet rifles and bb rifles from top brands including crosman, benjamin, fx, weihrauch, rws, hatsan and many others. if you have questions about any of the air rifles we feature in our inventory, please contact us for further assistance. we are always happy to help, and we look forward to hearing from you.categoriesspring piston air rifles10m competition air riflesnew air riflesair rifles by brandpellet riflesbb gun riflespcp air rifleshunting air riflesbig bore airgunsbullpup air riflesgas piston air riflesbreak barrel air riflesco2 air riflespump air riflesunderlever air riflesfixed barrel air riflesyouth airgunssynthetic stock air rifles filter by in stock only yes (232) caliber 0.177 (247) 0.20 (6) 0.22 (226) 0.25 (145) 0.257 (3) 0.30 (55) 0.357 (20) 0.45 (18) 0.50 (11) brands air arms (16) airforce (32) beeman (18) benjamin (31) crosman (32) daisy (12) fx airguns (45) gamo (13) hatsan (45) umarex (26) air venturi (5) airforce international (2) anschutz (1) asg (1) ataman (7) avanti (1) black ops (1) diana (10) edgun (7) feinwerkbau fwb (2) gletcher (1) hammerli (1) heckler & koch (1) hellraiser (1) kral arms (8) legends (1) raw rapid air worx (6) remington (1) ruger (5) seneca (10) sheridan (1) sig sauer (7) springfield armory (2) stoeger arms (3) swiss arms (2) walther (6) weihrauch (7) western justice (3) winchester (2) powerplant co2 (43) gas piston (40) multi-pump pneumatic (19) pcp and co2 (1) pre-charged pneumatic (221) spring-piston (49) action bolt-action (107) break barrel (66) lever-action (17) overlever (1) pump (3) semiautomatic (24) semiautomatic/full-auto (15) sidelever (129) underlever (11) rating 5 (66) 4 & up (255) 3 & up (288) 2 & up (294) 1 & up (295) price $0 -
