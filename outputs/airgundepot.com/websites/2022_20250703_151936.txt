an air rifle is a compressed air gun, that fires pellets down the rifled barrel. there are many different types of air rifles, but all use compressed air to fire a projectile. air rifle powerplants are divided into three groups. the spring-piston, which utilizes energy stored in the spring. pneumatic, which uses internally stored pressurized gas. last we have, compressed gas (most commonly co2), which uses external sources of pressurized gas. air rifles can be used for small game hunting, pest control, and even recreational shooting (commonly known as plinking). there are also competitive sports such as the olympic 10m and field target (ft). so no matter what you want your air rifle for, it can meet those needs. if you have questions about any of the air rifles we feature in our inventory, please contact us for further assistance. we are always happy to help, and we look forward to hearing from you.categoriesspring piston air rifles10m competition air riflesnew air riflesair rifles by brandpellet riflesbb gun riflespcp air rifleshunting air riflesbig bore airgunsbullpup air riflesgas piston air riflesbreak barrel air riflesco2 air riflespump air riflesunderlever air riflesfixed barrel air riflesyouth airgunssynthetic stock air rifles filter by caliber 0.177 (223) 0.20 (7) 0.22 (224) 0.25 (150) 0.257 (5) 0.30 (69) 0.357 (19) 0.45 (8) 0.457 (11) 0.50 (5) 0.51 (10) 0.615 (1) brands air arms (15) airforce (32) beeman (13) benjamin (34) crosman (33) fx airguns (51) gamo (13) hatsan (40) raw rapid air worx (12) umarex (26) air venturi (4) anschutz (2) ataman (6) avanti (1) barra (3) black ops (1) daisy (10) diana (10) edgun (2) feinwerkbau fwb (4) gletcher (2) heckler & koch (3) hellraiser (1) jts airguns (2) kral arms (5) legends (1) ruger (2) seneca (11) sig sauer (9) springfield armory (2) stoeger arms (1) walther (4) weihrauch (6) western justice (3) winchester (2) powerplant aeg (1) co2 (30) gas piston (31) multi-pump pneumatic (18) pcp and co2 (12) pre-charged pneumatic (229) spring-piston (41) velocity (fps) 0-250 (1) 250-500 (45) 500-750 (54) 750-1000 (152) 1000 and up (113) action bolt-action (105) break barrel (52) lever-action (16) overlever (1) pump (2) semiautomatic (26) semiautomatic/full-auto (18) sidelever (135) underlever (9) price $0 - $100 (29) $100 - $250 (84) $250 - $500 (59) $500 - $1,000 (86) $1,000+ (108) airgun use competition (17) hunting (51) plinking & target practice (16) plinking/fun (58) small game hunting/plinking (66) small game hunting/target practice (151) rating 5 (57) 4 & up (223) 3 & up (260) 2 & up (266) 1 & up (267) in stock only yes (303) loudness 1-low (15) 2-low-medium (86) 3-medium (183) 4-medium-high (60) 5-high (22) blowback yes (16) fire mode repeater (253) single-shot (112) promotions deal (10) exclusive (34) free gear (70) free gear sale (1) new (8) sale (77) sale free gear (2) exclusive savings sign up for an exclusive offer, news, tips and more! view suggestions airgun finder what kind of airgun are you looking for?
