choosing the right ski for the job can be the difference between just getting down the hill and slaying your runs like you’re being filmed from a helicopter. after choosing the right length, pick a shape that matches the snow, the terrain, and your riding style. if you're putting in four turns down a three thousand foot alaska face, you'll want to choose a very long turn radius and a rockered camber to keep them on top of the snow. if you're making quick turns down groomed hardpack, you'll want exactly the opposite. what’s right for you requires some research and thought, so dig in and find the skis to get you there. want to know more?call 1-855-461-8621 or chat now to speak with one of our ski gearheads. need help? talk to our gearheads 24/7 about all of your gear related needs.
