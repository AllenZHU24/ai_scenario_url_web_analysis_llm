bootpacking into the backcountry will leave you a miserable wreck in a hurry, instead, an alpine touring binding is the answer. an alpine touring binding is a ski binding that allows you to go free-heel for the ascent and then lock your heel in place for the descent. one style of at binding requires an at-specific boot while the other allows you to use a standard alpine boot for your backcountry pow-fest. either way an at binding is the fastest, most efficient way to stay connected to your ski and travel in the backcountry while wearing ski boots. alpine compatible: an alpine-compatible at binding offers an adjustable din, a burly construction, and accept a standard alpine ski boot without any special fittings. this binding can serve as a do-it-all backcountry and resort binding. tech compatible: ultralight and minimalist by design, this binding style requires a ski boot with tech-compatible heel and toe fittings. this binding style places a premium on stride efficiency and low weight, rather than adjustability. other features: heel risers or climbing wires can give you a boost under your heel for climbing steep hills. keep in mind, adjustable release settings and brakes aren’t standard on some ultralight tech binders—consider your options carefully. need help? talk to our gearheads 24/7 about all of your gear related needs. live chat call:
