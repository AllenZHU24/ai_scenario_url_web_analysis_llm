i’m brooklynn, a backcountry gearhead. i love this fleece – it is amazing for all seasons. i’ve worn a ton of different fleece jackets but i always keep reaching for this one. it is a must-have piece for the wasatch: our very own timpanogos fleece jacket from backcountry. this jacket was designed with input from gearheads like me, so it takes into account what i feel makes a great jacket. i love this fleece for so many different things. i ski and snowboard and this makes a great midlayer piece. this fleece is perfect for a cold day up on the mountain and it also looks really cute just with some jeans or leggings. the timpanogos fleece has an active and flattering fit. it also has thumbholes so your sleeves won’t bunch up under other layers. the fleece on the inside is nice and soft against your skin and the neck zips up nice and tall to keep that cold air out. there is a little pouch at the top of the zipper to store the zipper dongle so you don’t have to have that cold zipper touching your skin. backcountry didn’t skimp on pockets which are so necessary for me. the two hand pockets are large enough for my phone and keys and the small arm pocket is great for stashing smaller things. if you are wondering what size to get i am 5’2 and 100lbs and i wear an extra small! thanks for watching gearhead picks! if you have any questions about the backcountry timpanogos tech fleece jacket or any other backcountry apparel, you can reach out to brooklynn directly at bhall@backcountry.com. need help? talk to our gearheads 24/7 about your needs.call usor call: 1-800-409-4502stay in the knowbe the first to see sales & new gear!email addresssubmitgift certificatesshop by categoryorder statuse-gift certificateclassic gift cardresources create a wedding registry returns order status sale item policy sales tax policy terms of use privacy policy do not sell my personal data international shipping policy learning resources gift card terms & conditions special group offers about backcountryabout backcountrypress releasesgroup salesland your dream jobaffiliate programaccessibility statementwhat's wrong with this page?like us on facebookfollow us on instagramfollow us on twittersubscribe to us on youtubedownload the backcountry app© backcountry.com – all rights reserved
