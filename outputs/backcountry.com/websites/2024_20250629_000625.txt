after requesting a return from the order history in your account profile, or you can request that a gearhead email you the label. the $6.99 price for the flat rate label will be deducted from the refund or store credit issued for your return. the price of the flat rate label may vary during promotional periods.please note that this return process (using a flat rate shipping label) does not
