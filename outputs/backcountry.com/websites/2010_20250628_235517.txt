has anyone ever put these on tele boots for vertical ice climbing? – randomintelligentguy – jan. 7, 2011 a: well, the short answer is maybe. regular crampon toe bails (with a few rare exceptions) don’t fit over the wide duck bill on the front of telemark boots. some companies like petzl make replacement toe bails designed specifically for telemark boots, but i can’t find any indication that cassin makes a similar attachment. however, nearly all toe bails attach the same way, so you may be able to get away with using the petzl bails on these crampons, but i’m not positive. anyone? to address the vertical ice part of the questions—you won’t get the same performance as you would with actual climbing boots, or even close. putting crampons on tele boots is generally a ski mountaineering move. the problem is that the duck bill will cover part of the front points and you won’t get very good penetration no matter how hard you kick into the ice. you can definitely climb this way, but if you want to get serious about ice climbing, just get some ice climbing boots. have a better answer?
