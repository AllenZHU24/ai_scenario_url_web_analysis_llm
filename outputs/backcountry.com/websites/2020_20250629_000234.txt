family. months later, i found out the person i was gifting to never received it. i discovered i was charged, but no gift card was sent. i called customer support, and was told the recipient email ended up in the wrong field for some reason they were unclear about. i would be surprised if i made an error like that (although it's not impossible), but i'm definitely disappointed i wasn't contacted about the error despite being charged. it seems like it would be straight forward enough to detect when a gift card is ordered but it doesn't actually get sent to anyone.aistis t.leave a

vincent mauroleave a commment report>rating: 5november 6, 2017fastbackcountry has two forms of gift certs. a hard card or in digital form. this is the way to go for that millennial who live on their phone. i'd suggest printing out the email you receive after you purchase so the gift receiver at least can have something physical (slide it in a card maybe) and forward the email later on. simply redeem online at any time! hassle free. case turnerleave a commment report>rating: 5october 31, 2017very fastbackcountry.com egift cards are a great last minute gift. they're delivered within minutes

email telling me that i got $10 off my next order. the email said that it was just $10 off, straight up, no strings attached. the offer expired in a few weeks so i didn't want a free $10 to go to waste. i decided to put the "no strings attached" promise to the test. i was happy to discover that i could indeed use my free $10 towards a $25 gift certificate, locking in this free money for two years. i later used this gift certificate towards the purchase of much needed clothing. can't think of too many places i'd rather get a gift certificate for.matt rleave a commment reportflagged as

i've bought enough to cover the cost of the purchases. here's my question; say it takes me six months or so to save enough gift certificates to make the purchases, can i ensure the model i want (c4waterman standem) is still available? thanks in advance for your time! brooksbrooks johnsonleave a commment reportcory gurumay 27, 2010nice setup!! but sorry, no, the only way to reserve an item and pull it from inventory is to purchase it. report>rating: january 7, 2010thank you, angus! in itself, as a response...thank you, angus! in itself, as a response so promptly made and thoughtfully sent, i continue to be grateful for and inspired by backcountry and the community that supports it. my troubles with this gear certificate remain (for reasons i'll mention), but i wanted to mention that i made a purchase anyway, and regardless of the fate of a certificate i have only myself to blame for its datedness, i will continue to be a strong advocate of the backcountry enterprise. the paper gear certificate issued in 2003 has an "authorized gear guru" signature on it, in real ink, (name of guru: gilbert) and because my brother was never in utah, i conclude that the certificate must have been sent to him in the mail - perhaps before the e-certificates became a common practice. the certificate measures about 3.75in high x 8.5in. wide, and has the logo of a mountain peak in the background, stretching the width of the card. but besides the 5-digit code, there is no further information.victorleave a commment reportangus bohanonjanuary 7, 2010that's the most positive response i've ever gotten. i'm actually so jaded that i thought you were being sarcastic at first. given your new set of circumstances, it would seem that the protocol for gift certificates has changed since yours was issued. i'd get on live chat again, explain the situation again (including that you're now sure it's the right store), and maybe they can send you a new one. you'd think the old one would be on record somewhere so they could verify it. otherwise, assuming you already tried entering the code where i told you and that didn't work, you may just have to cut your losses. hope there wasn't too much money on the certificate (and that you can actually get to it somehow), and good luck! report>rating: january 7, 2010i have a paper gift certificate that is...i have a paper gift certificate that is quite old...a gift from my brother for my birthday in 2003. while the gift certificate states that it will not expire, and while there is a 5-digit code stamped on the front, i do not know how or indeed if it can be redeemed via your on-line store. i received great help from one of your staff with whom i "chatted" on-line. at the end of that conversation, i had convinced both him and myself that i had mistaken "the backcountry store" with backcountry, given that the certificate listed the following website: "www.backcountrystore.com." but when, subsequently, i searched on-line for "the backcountry store," every search directed me to your store. and for further confirmation, i checked other details on my paper certificate: and indeed, the telephone number and location matched up exactly with yours. this leaves me wondering what to do with this "gear certificate"? and ultimately can it be redeemed?victorleave a commment reportangus bohanonjanuary 7, 2010when you get to checkout, look for a little link that says "gift certificate: click here to redeem." i attached a photo of what that looks like; it'll be under item 5: enter your payment information if you're not signed in or under item 1: verify your payment information if you are. hope that helps and hope you get your money. excellent sleuthing work too. report>rating: october 18, 2009can i use a backcountry

certificate, could i make five separate $100 purchases?sbdivemasterleave a commment reportangus bohanonoctober 18, 2009absolutely. it's like store credit, you can spread it out as much as you want. i'd advise purchases no smaller than $50 though, you don't want to spend your certificate on shipping. reportsnowbirdoctober 8, 2010also, keep in mind that you can only use one certificate per online order, so don't stock up on $50 certificates thinking you can use three of them on your $150 order. reportjoshua moorejanuary 9, 2011i have run into the problem of stocking up on gift certificates.
