ideas for an outdoorsy type this holiday season? we asked our gearheads for tips, and they all said the same thing: you can’t go wrong with giving the gift of gear! so whether you’re shopping for your life/adventure partner, grown-up groms, or perhaps even yourself, you’ll find the perfect outdoor gift right here. without further ado, here’s our exhaustive list of outdoorsy christmas gift ideas—plus 18 ready-to-wrap gifts for outdoor lovers—for 2024.it’s a haul-iday!gear gifts for men, women, kids & petsshop our gift guidegift ideas for skiers & snowboarderssome gifts for snow enthusiasts—like a thigh-deep pow day or a lift ticket—are tougher to wrap up than others. if you aren’t a convert to winter sports yet, getting yourself a pair of planks and a lesson could be the ultimate gift for a partner who loves sliding on snow more than everything (other than you), and if you already ski or snowboard, a shared day on the mountain could be a gift enough. but what about gifts that pair well with ribbon? boots and boards can be a personal decision, so we reserve gifting the biggest snow purchases to those that have sent us a very specific wish list and for growing groms. other snow essentials—like goggles, spf lip balms, hand warmers, and gloves—are easier to get right. so when you’re wrapping up snow gifts this season, consider wrapping them up in warm winter baselayers or a brand-new kit.our top gift picks for skiers & snowboarderscottonwoods gore-tex shell jacketprotect their stoke this winter with our bestselling hardshell jacket for men and women.shop

planning out meals for your next camping weekend and offering to carry extra weight the next time you go backpacking is sure to delight. meanwhile, updating outdated gear like a weathered daypack, faulty trekking poles or a clunky camp stove can enhance their next trip. small gifts—like colorfully, cutely patterned wool socks, patch kits for worn jackets and sleeping bags, and their trail snack of choice—give a knowing nod to their favorite activity. and finally, trail- and campfire-approved apparel will keep them stoked no matter the weather.our top gift picks for campers & hikerspeale

outdoor presents in our gift guide.gift ideas for mountain bikers & rock climbersfor that friend or loved one who takes everything to the extreme, it’s important to match their energy with the right gift. your hero-dirt homies and crag compadres will both appreciate updates to vital safety equipment for the holidays. both climbing and bike helmets, for example, need to be replaced after major impacts, but sticker shock often leads to these noggin-protectors being used long after it’s time for retirement. meanwhile, consumable gifts take on a different meaning for these adventurers (though they love gummy worms and small sippables as much as the next). think chalk, finger tape, and a gift card for new climbing shoes for a rock jock and chain lube, spare tubes, and back-up gloves for your pedal pals. and finally, giving essential wearable gear like our tahoe sun protection as a gift goes a long way to show you care. here are a few we’re hype about.our top gift picks for mountain

gift guide.gift ideas for runners & trail runnerswhen it comes to gifts for many milers, the first thing on their wish list is probably “come run with me!” beyond lacing up your own pair of sneaks, there are plenty of other gifts you could give. if they’ve been on the hunt for a better place to store their house key than the waist band of their shorts, a running vest will keep them hydrated and offer plenty of storage for essentials like their phone, snacks, a packable layer, and, of course, their keys. you can also protect them from the elements as a gift: packable rain layers, ultralight baselayers, lightweight gloves, and fleece-lined tights are all appreciated for cold-weather runs. meanwhile, a comfortable and bright headlamp keeps them visible and safe during winter’s pre-dawn or after-dark excursions. and when it comes to a splurge, gifting something they want but aren’t ready to buy themselves like our picks below is always a win.our top gift picks for runnersforerunner 165

give a solid gift. some basic outdoor essentials like beanies, ball caps, sunglasses, gloves, socks, and buffs all fall easily under the $50 mark. beyond accessories, trendy tumblers, can insulators, and water bottles are also notoriously giftable—though if you’re shopping for a youngster, we recommend asking them what the latest trend is to avoid any potential disappointment. another option when searching for affordable gifts is to check the sale section. holiday promotions like black friday and cyber monday are the perfect time to find delightful outdoor gifts without budging from your budget. here are two price-conscious gifts that no one will blink twice at on christmas morning.our top gifts under $50the quencher h2.0 flowstate 40oz tumblerstanley’s classic cup is always a big hit. we especially love it for road trip enthusiasts—it’s a great fit for most standard vehicle drink holders.shop the quencherventure beyond merino blend ski sockwarm up their toes as they explore the mountain with a pair of performance socks.shop this ski sockshop gifts under $25shop gifts under $50shop gifts under $100stocking stuffersdo you open stocking stuffers first, or does your crew go for the big gifts first, leaving the stockings for a delightful finale? either way, these small, lightweight gifts are your first—or last—chance to make a memorable impression. when you’re gift shopping for someone outdoorsy, trading candy canes for energy chews and tsa-approved miniature liquor bottles for electrolyte mixes could be a hit. then again, indulging in “vices” with their backpacking candy or post-send adult beverage of choice might be the better move, depending on the person. cozy socks, beanies, and neckwear easily pack down small enough to fit in a stocking. heck, we even made some down pants and down jackets this year that would squeeze in there, too! and finally, don’t be afraid to mingle an itty-bitty, big-ticket gift along with the uncracked walnut and shareable chocolate orange. techy gadgets, fancy utility knives, gift cards, emergency headlamps, and other pricier items can offer a delightful surprise amid a collection of tasty treats and giggle-inducing gag gifts.our top stocking stuffersthe redstone knifethis all-duty tool ensures they’re ready for anything. because it’s pocket sized, it’s a great addition to an outdoorsman’s
