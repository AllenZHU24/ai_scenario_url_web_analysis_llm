(0) (1) flag that's the most positive response i've ever gotten. i'm actually so jaded that i thought you were being sarcastic at first. given your new set of circumstances, it would seem that the protocol for gift certificates has changed since yours was issued. i'd get on live chat again, explain the situation again (including that you're now sure it's the right store), and maybe they can send you a new one. you'd think the old one would be on record somewhere so they could verify it. otherwise, assuming you already tried entering the code where i told you and that didn't work, you may just have to cut your losses. hope there wasn't too much money on the certificate (and that you can actually get to it somehow), and good luck! by: angus bohanon january 7, 2010 was this helpful?
