see profile east coast death ice or the greatest snow on earth? its easy to see why backcountry shop team rider jamey parks chose to settle down in the wasatch. jamey can sometimes be found rallying around european mega resorts or heli skiing in bc, but most of the time he just hitch hikes into his backyard playground to enjoy 500+ inches a year of the lightest puder-schnee available. parks has graced three warren miller films with his presence, as well as edits and films from the levitation project. jamey represents salomon, snowbird, alta, smith, discrete headwear, ogio, surefoot, and the levitation project. if someone rips past or over you the next time you find yourself in the wasatch backcountry, there's a good chance you just had a brush with jamey parks. jenn berg click to see profile jenn berg grew up ski racing and ripping around tahoe with guys like erik roner, so its only natural that at some point shed go pro. a semester at chico state followed high school, but the lure of squaw powder and free alaskan heli-trips was just too good to pass up, so jenn switched majors. skiing became her study, and the next decade focused on dominating the world extreme ski championships with teammates shane mcconkey and brad holmes, and starring alongside every ski icon you can name in warren miller and the north face ski films. but in 2007, after saving her sponsorship money for fall courses every year, she graduated from the university of nevada with a degree in business marketing. along the way, shes picked up sponsorships from volkl/ marker, tecnica, and mountain hardwear, and switched her focus from the sport side of skiing back to the spreadsheet side, landing her first legit gig right here in the marketing division of backcountry.com. so jenns not just a ripping skier, a film star, a lady sledneck, a motocrosser, a tgr camerawoman and a coworker, shes also family. its only right that she should wear the goat. nice one, berg. seth morrison click to see profile imagine for a moment that your name is jack, and that the beans you just traded for your dads only cow are currently sprouting a giant beanstalk to a castle in the sky before your eyes. if you are a skier, you can expect a similar revelation the first time you see seth morrison in a film segment. from rocking pink hair when it wasnt cool and riding out of 160-foot front flips on one ski, to outrunning avalanches and surviving a helicopter crash, the soft-spoken man who started blowing minds in matchstick productions 1994 film the hedonist has turned refuting the impossible into a business. fifteen years later, with countless films, awards, and minutes of airtime to back up his rep, morrison is a living legend in the ski world. he leads k2s factory team, and has developed his own pro models with hestra, full tilt boots, troy lee designs and oakley not to mention the award-winning k2 obsethed ski. we cant even begin to describe how stoked we are to have seth on our team. chris davenport julian carr eric roner chris davenport click to see profile have you ever heard someone say that dude skis more in one year than most people do in their whole life? with chris davenport, its the truth. during the winter of 06/07, davenport set a record by skiing all 54 of colorado peaks above 14000ft in a single season. the previous record? it took 13 years to ski them all. chris has dominated freeskiing competitions (taking home two world tour first place finishes), appeared in more than 25 ski films by big names like warren miller and matchstick productions. he has logged first descents on several continents, and many consider him to be the most accomplished big mountain skier in the world. chris, who wants to give back to the sport more than he wants recognition, also works as a ski guide in colorado, canada, and switzerland. of course were chriss favorite, but his other sponsors include helly hansen, giro, smith, scott, black diamond equipment, bca, and red bull. julian carr click to see profile julian carr will calmly discuss snowpack, weight distribution, terminal velocity and angle of impact with you, and for a moment, you will actually believe he is not certifiably insane. however, the moment you see how he is applying this science, you will likely wonder two things: 1) how did he escape from his straitjacket, and 2) who gave him a pair of skis? julian, quite simply, drops the biggest cliffs ever caught on film. cliffs that still put a pit in your stomach after the fourth or fifth time youve rewound the clip and watched a 170-pound neck-beard from salt lake city fall hundreds of feet through the air into the snow below. this alone should be enough to score a place on the backcountry team, but we like julian for another reason: hes way more than just a crash test dummy. its one thing to launch ones meat off massive rock faces in search of fame and fortune; its another thing entirely to compete in freeskiing tournaments, start discrete headwear , star in movies, write poetry and magazine features, and live a generally awesome life. julians a multi-talented guy who would clearly make it in this industry even without his addiction to lunatic air. were just lucky hes got a screw loose, cause we love to watch him do his thing. eric roner click to see profile if you see a guy wearing skis and a parachute floating down off the gnarliest cliff at your home resort, chances are erik roner has come to visit. since blowing peoples minds with his skibase segment in tgrs the tangerine dream back in 2005, erik has continued to push the forefront of the freeskiing movement. from hucking off of jackson holes previously un-skied cajun couloir to co-starring in travis pastranas daredevil reality series nitro circus, it seems roners bag of tricks has no bottom. erik haunts the tahoe ski scene whenever he isnt scoping new hucks, and you can look forward to seeing more from him in tgrs latest film, re-session. erik represents dynastar, lange, scott, ogio, dna, hi-ball energy, sweet protection and plenty of adrenaline. don bowie cody barnhill julia niles don bowie click to see profile when don isn't bagging peaks on baffin island or the himalayas, he can be found wrestling mountain lions with his bare hands for california's fish and game department, or saving lives as an serves as an active team member with the inyo county sheriff search and rescue team. impressed? to add to his resume of manliness, this bishop, canada-born transplant has returned from successful expeditions to broad peak, cho oyu, and the south face and east ridge of annapurna, and now has over four season's worth of experience in the himalayan range. in 2007, along with the k2 shared summits expedition, don summited the 28,253-foot peak without supplemental oxygen, sherpas, or fixed camps, and in 2008 he set his sights on the first winter ascent of a karakoram 8000-meter peak. dons other sponsors read like a whos-who of hardcore alpine gear: event fabric, westcomb, feathered friends, la sportiva, and jetboil. looking for alpine inspiration? look no further. cody barnhill click to see profile cody barnhill grew up watching jp auclair, shane szocs, seth morrison, and other 1990s new-school skiers throwing down in the terrain park. his home mountain outside anchorage, ak, didnt have a park, so he learned to do tricks off cliffs and windlips instead. he only placed 42nd in his first big mountain freeski competition, but 4frnt and smith took notice of barnhills balls-out cliff drop spins, and as a result he won a couple kickass sponsors. their investment paid off: at the 2005 subaru us freeskiing nationals at snowbird, he placed third. cody has since graduated from the freeski comp scene, and for the past couple years, he has been traveling around the world in search of snow with tgr and the levitation project. in addition to rossignol and smith, he is also sponsored by discrete headwear, skullcandy, and the north face. julia niles click to see profile julia niles doesnt get much down time. when shes not guiding climbing trips on denali, aconcagua, and in the tetons, shes off making first descents in british columbia and patagonia. she can on-sight up through 5.12a routes on rock, and up to grade 5 on ice. but julias not just tough on the mountaina few years ago she had a large tumor removed that left her with only half of her left lung. shortly after her surgery, niles became the first woman to free-solo the 10-peak teton route in a day. obviously, nothings going to hold julia back. karl meltzer kim havell noah howell karl meltzer click to see profile running for 20 hours straight isnt something the average person does for fun, but then again, your average joe doesnt win six of the worlds toughest ultramarathons in one calendar year. meltzers motto work to live, dont live to work pervades his lifestyle, but behind this sandy, ut residents laid-back demeanor, hides a mountain-crushing will. with 26 victories and counting, karl has won more 100-mile trail races than any other runner on earth, effectively throwing down the gauntlet for any would-be competitors. they have yet to arrive. in 2008 karl attempted to run the east coastthe entire east coastin record time: running the length of the 2176 mile appalachian trail from maine to georgia in fewer than 47 days. meltzer finished in 55, leaving the record of andrew thompson intact, but he has his sights on heading back soon for another go with all the valuable info from his first attempt under his belt. for 2009, two more 100-mile races await karls indomitable perseverance, and there is a chance that this will become the fifth year of winning four 100-mile races in a calendar year. thats a record that may stand till hes dead unless he breaks it again next year. kim havell click to see profile based in telluride, colorado, kim havell began her career in the mountains as an alpine ski coach. from there, she gradually made the transition to climbing and ski mountaineering, has tail-guided for h2o heli guides, been a guest instructor for the san juan outdoor school, cva, and babes in the backcountry, and is an eleven-year member of the san miguel county search and rescue team with both medical and rescue certifications. kim has made numerous first female descents in southwest colorado, climbed and skied both the grand teton and mt. moran in a 2-day period, completed multiple ascents/descents of 13ers & ten 14ers in colorado, and cut lines on peaks in france, italy, canada, switzerland, alaska, russia, and japan. she has also climbed several peaks in the himalayas including lobuche (21,500ft) and ama dablam (22,600ft) in nepal, as well as an expedition to gasherbrum ii (26,351ft), pakistan, with some skiing from 24,000ft. recently she skied from the summit of denali (20,320ft) with an all-womens expedition group. kim is also a ski model and guide for the telluride ski resort, and has a passion for climbing the desert rock of indian creek, ut. her other sponsors include the north face, smith optics, camp usa, and salomon. noah howell click to see profile noah howell has life all backwards. instead of working toward a high-paying career so he can retire and just ski all the time, he punches the clock in alaska, baffin island, the french and swiss alps, and his home wasatch range so he can settle down with a cushy office job one day. noah has more first descents on his résumé than most people have ski days in a season. for now, howell reps zeal optics and mountain hardwear, "works" as a product tester for black diamond equipment, and rips technical ski-mountaineering descents all over the world. oh yeah, and he does it all on tele gear. maybe its the rest of us who have life backwards. sage cattabriga-alosa cedar wright jess mcmillan sage cattabriga-alosa click to see profile when most people think of sage cattabriga-alosa they think of alta hippy stink. most people are right: sages stink on film is so filthy it puts all big-mountain jib skiers to shame. instead of looking at a line and thinking about its limitations, sage turns the mountain into a work of art, flipping, spinning, and just getting downright messy in ways that nobody dreamed possible. in 2004, he won the best male performance award from powder magazine. since then, sage has been filming with teton gravity research, skiing some of the most progressive segments in the last ten years, and doing things off of massive booters and cliffs that were only a dirty fantasy before he hit them. hes won many more awards and pushed the sport to a new level all on his own. that's the stank we like to smell. sage lists atomic, the north face, and smith among his sponsors. cedar wright click to see profile cedar wright: badass b-boy, speed climber extraordinaire, and backcountry.com team athlete. but thats only the beginning. from sending a 40-foot chain-link fence at age four to free-climbing el cap, cedar has made a lifetime pursuit of disguising his true aspirations. his ultimate goals, in his own words, are world domination with atomic-laser mind controllers and catapulting a shark over the white house. while these projects await completion, cedar bides his time organizing a totally sweet spiderman comic book collection, dabbling in final cut pro, reading minds, and starring in climbing movies to meet the demands of his sponsors, the north face, bluewater, black diamond, and five ten. jess mcmillan click to see profile if you havent already heard of her, chances are jess mcmillan will become a household name in the very near future. with the freeskiing world tour and us freeskiing nationals titles under her belt and signed sponsors like jackson hole, cloudveil, crashpads, shred alert hats, volkl, tecnica, marker, scott usa, and dakine, jess has a brighter-than-the-tram-towers-on-a-bluebird-day future. this wyoming native earned her chops bagging us downhill championships from 93 to 95, coaching the jackson hole ski and freeride teams. she even found time to spend three straight years kayakingthats right, three years off and she can still out-ski the best of em. from untouched big mountain lines in france to making all the dudes in jackson jealous, jess charges hard and loves every minute of it. jeremy jones chris tatsuno renan ozturk jeremy jones click to see profile jeremy jonesnot to be confused with the eponymous freestyle jibberis the big mountain badass. although this teton gravity research mainstay has defined and redefined big mountain freeride snowboarding for the last 20-plus years, he remains incredibly humble and down-to-earth. today, jones designs his own line of high performance boards, bindings, and accessories in collaboration with top names in the industry. when hes not riding fluted 55-degree ak faces, jones is busy being a new dad and putting his energy into environmentally conscious side projects. jeremy is co-founder of protect our winters, a non-profit dedicated to reversing global warming, and the creator behind the teton gravity research film deeper, in which he eschews heli and snowmobile transport in favor of the split board. we know that his other sponsors like bern, oneill, scott, bluebird wax and camelbak are as stoked as we are to have him on their teams. chris tatsuno click to see profile chris tatsunos dedication to skiing runs a little deeper than the average powder hound. instead of getting a house in a ski town and buying a season pass, chris lives in a van (the tatvan) that probably cost him less than his favorite blizzard planks. he drives around the country to compete in freeskiing competitions and rip the burliest terrain wherever he goes, proving his worth in several us freeskiing championships and taking the coveted sick bird award at the telluride freeskiing open. when hes not blending big mountain and freestyle like a human blender, chris maintains a blog, which he updates frequently with stories of epic skiing and the resulting parties that follow, and hes super active on facebook. he is also sponsored by scott, poc, helly hansen, aspenfreeride.com, discrete headwear, and tecnica. renan ozturk click to see profile renan ozturk might sound like an ottoman emperor, but we assure you: hes way more about conquering impossible routes than routing eastern roman outposts. since he made headlines with a jaw-dropping on-sight free solo of north six shooter in 2004, renan has remained at the forefront of climbings elite, chalking up first ascents from the bugaboos to the himalayas, pulling down hard in climbing films and expressing his visions with pen, ink, and watercolor as well as mixed media. you can catch renan in return2sender (sender films 2005), patagonia promise (sender films 2009), and secrets of shangri-la (national geographic 2009), or on his mountain bike during his (non-existent) off-season. aside from being a crucial member of the backcountry.com pro team and the record holder for fastest athlete email response renan is also sponsored by black diamond, the north face, brunton, suunto, and la sportiva. will cardamone andrew mclean ingrid backstrom will cardamone click to see profile man, i wish id started skiing earlier is something will cardamone cant say with a straight face. wills dad built him a pair of custom wooden skis to wear around the house as soon as he could walk, and it wasnt long after that he tried to ski the stairs. he started ski racing at age 10, but as soon as he discovered freeskiing he dropped the race course like third-period french to focus on going big. still needing more challenge, will switched to telemark gear and took his park-honed skills to big-mountain runs and freeskiing competitions, where he now amazes even those without free heels. with the help of his other sponsors black diamond and cloudveil, cardamone is taking it beyond the next level. andrew mclean click to see profile you won't find andrew mclean in the resort very often. he prefers to leave home and track down steep technical lines in remote regions of the world. with more than 120 first descents to his name (many unrepeated) and trips to places most people have never even heard of, andrews résumé makes your palms sweat and your mouth water. his book the chuting gallery: a guide to steep skiing in the wasatch mountains gives readers a glimpse of what andrew does in his local mountains and has become the dream list for serious utah skiers. mclean has skied on all seven continents and in 2009 completed a lifetime dream to ski off the top of all three of the alaska mountain range family  denali, sultana and mt. hunter. during the summer he rides a mountain unicycle on the singletrack trails around his home in park city and enjoys rock climbing. as a product designer by profession, andrew has worked for black diamond equipment where he designed the whippet self arrest ski pole, the first wire-gate climbing carabiner (the hotwire), peckers, talons and the single stem camalot. his other sponsors include mountain hardwear, scarpa, dynafit, k2 alpine touring, suunto, smith, and msr. ingrid backstrom click to see profile ingrid backstrom jumped from squaw valley ski bum to ski movie superstar with the three-turn descent of a 1,500 vertical foot bella coola line captured in matchstick productions 2004 ski film, yearbook. after that, dominating the freeski comp scene took a backseat for this seattle native, who has since appeared in countless ski flicks from matchstick and warren miller. backstrom says the secret to her success is in confronting her fears and picking lines that scare me enough to perform my best. this mantra has served her well; in 2002, ingrid was powder magazine's first-ever female future big mountain hero and has won awards for "best female performance" and "breakthrough performance" for her ballsy ski film segments. although ingrid pretty much smokes the majority of the ladies (and some dudes too) when it comes to big lines, nobody talks shit. she is down-to-earth, gracious, and radiates a love for the mountains that is downright contagious. her sponsors include the north face, volkl, marker, giro, and tecnica stephen koch abbey smith steph davis stephen koch click to see profile stephen koch began snowboarding at the jackson hole mountain resort in the late 80s, and has since combined his love for the sport with his passion for climbing, allowing him to do over 50 first descents of remote and difficult lines on peaks on all over the world. from his own backyard of the tetons to the seven summits, stephen has pioneered snowboard mountaineering (a term he coined), and holds many difficult mountaineering ticks as well, including the first 48-hour single-push ascent of light traveler, arguably the hardest route on denali, and the first winter traverse of the teton range, considered one of the last great achievements in american mountaineering. after surviving an avalanche that sent him 2000 feet down the steep and cliff-riddled northeast face of mount owen, the 40-year-old koch spent the night out with multiple severe injuries in only a long underwear top and schoeller pants at over 9,000. six knee surgeries and eleven months after his tumble, stephen returned to the mountain and completed the first descent of the very same face that punished him the previous year. he returned to prove a point: when you are knocked downno matter how hardit is not only possible but necessary to get up, brush yourself off and get back to it. stephen is the founder and president of the avalanche awareness foundation and has been introducing people to backcountry snowboarding, skiing and climbing for over 18 years as a senior exum mountain guide. abbey smith click to see profile abbey smith knows how to write. damn well, in fact. she can hack it behind a camera lens too, when shes not pulling down in front of one. in fact, given her more conventional list of talents you might ask why she doesnt give up the risk-laden life of a pro athlete and go full-on career professional in her chosen major of journalism. but before you piss anyone off with ridiculous inquiries, allow us to take a stab at answering in abbeys place: rocks, stupid. big ones. abbey can climb. like a starving monkey up a banana tree. like stock prices when apple releases a new gadget. like your blood pressure after a 4x4 at in-n-out. like a you get the point. abbeys a bouldering wizardress with so many experience points, they renamed attractive north denver when she moved to colorado, calling it boulder in her honor. her name is tacked onto first ascents around the globe from thailand to utah, with many more to come. men want her, women want to be her. hell, men want to be her too. we just want her on our team. steph davis click to see profile steph davis does not know how old she is, at least in human years, and she says shes never had a breakout moment in her entire career. she has no list of goals, and names dogs, cats, cleaning, and her friend lisas disco band among her interests, the others of which are generally too lewd or mundane to include here. in fact, we dont really know why she is on the backcountry.com team in the first place, other than her ability to do things like free-climb the salathe wall, conquer tombstone in moab, and ascend torre egger in a day. oh yeah, and she also base jumps in a wingsuit from the top of super-high-difficulty routes, writes books, practices yoga and promotes a vegan lifestyle while maintaining sponsorships with msr, five ten, prana, mammut, clif bar, and therm-a-rest. so, she has that going for her, which is nice. kasha rigby greg hill matt hart kasha rigby click to see profile kasha rigbys solid and diverse skills of skiing, mountaineering, and snow-kiting allow her to travel the world and pick off first descents in remote regions that most westerners will never visit. she has skied from over 8000m on cho oyu, skied 21 peaks in 21 days during a bolivia trip, and toured from the yukon territories to dry bay, alaska, but kasha has never harbored a desire to be one of the boys like so many female skiers; instead, she organizes all-womens trips like her recent expeditions to baffin island and mongolia, leading the way in a world previously dominated by the male gender. whether she likes it or not, there are not a lot of boys who can keep up with her. did we mention that she does it all on telemark gear? greg hill click to see profile pop quiz please circle all that apply: ive skipped school to go skiing since the age of two i dislocated my shoulder climbing and turned to ski mountaineering i subsequently won the whistler randonnee race while rocking a mullet and hugely inappropriate skis, and have repeated that feat twice i skied one million vertical feet in a season i skied 80 ten-thousand-foot days in a season i produced, directed, and starred in my own banff film festival finalist submission i was the first person to traverse the 21 summits of the northern monashees, and i did it in 21 days if you circled all of the above, congratulations. your name is greg hill, youre an absolute animal in the ski mountaineering arena, and youre a member of the backcountry.com pro team. you have a mantra: breathe and believe, which has pushed you to a world-record 50,000 feet of vertical in 24 hours. your other sponsors include arcteryx, suunto, and dynafit. a+ (see us after class; we think you cheated) matt hart click to see profile unless you are heavily into the ultra-running scene, youve likely never heard of matt hart. and since you havent been paying attention, you dont know that in the last three years matt has won or made the podium in over 19 endurance races from hawaii to canada and hed have won more if it werent for a recent injury that took him out of competition for most of 2009. were not just talking about running, either; while harts speed is feared on the ultramarathon circuit, hes taken home trophies for 24-hour solo mountain biking, adventure racing, and ski mountaineering to boot. his sponsors ( mountain hardwear, nuun, montrail, teko, rudy project, and nathan human propulsion labs) read like a long-distance trail runners dream team. in essence, hes the badass living next door who you never invited to your barbecue. and you should be ashamed of yourself, cause hes a real nice guy. jackie paaso andy jacobsen nick devore jackie paaso click to see profile from placing second in a local nastar race at the age of six, to entering and winning the snowbird freeski nationals in her first season and grabbing the first sickbird buckle ever awarded to a female, jacklyn paaso has proven shes no shrinking violet. in the off-season, jackies a backpacker, biker, and all-around athlete, but youll really see her shine when she clicks into a pair of skis and points it off the nearest cliff. while shes only been in one film to date (ak the hard way, 2008), were sure thats probably a temporary situation, and you can always replay last years us freeskiing series or visit her blog to see her shred. for now, youll have to keep an eye out for her as she bikes down the entire west coast on two sore buns, and wait for her next highlight reel. in addition to killing it as a backcountry.com team member, jackie skis for electric, bern, moment, and unofficialsquaw.com. andy jacobsen click to see profile confirmed fact: the least-hippy pro telemark skier in the world has 67 stitches in his ass. andy jacobsenthe aforementioned non-flower-childis pure soul skier. he worships in the white chapel of powder snow, genuflecting to the flake and anointing himself with holy face shots as often as humanly possible. from his first days bending wood in leather boots to chalking first descents with powderwhore productions, andy has lived by the mantra, if it aint broke, break it! and today lists ground outerwear, black diamond, alta and discrete headwear among his sponsors. when hes not dipping a knee into the fluffy fresh, jacobsen enjoys climbing, walking extremely fast, and competing in beer fris. hell show you the rules, but you have to catch him first. good luck. nick devore click to see profile catch one of nick devores film sequences and youll get an idea of what all the hype is about. devore quite simply tears mountains apart and hes a telemarker. nick is happy to reign as one of the smoothest tele-gurus on the planet, and the only freeheeler to ever make the finals on the snowbird segment of the ifsa tour. when hes not scoring first descents on denali, señor devore crochets hats for his company sensei stitches, pulls down on thai limestone, and lives the clean, green life of a dedicated yogi and farmer. like his sponsors cloudveil and black diamond, were honored to have nick skiing for our team. drew tabke evan stevens grete eliassen drew tabke click to see profile winning the subaru u.s. freeskiing national finals at snowbird is the dream of most any dyed-in-the-wool two-planker, and drew tabke is definitely livin the dream. born in hawaii, but raised in the heart of the powder-choked wasatch mountains, tabke started on the gentle slopes of park city ski area, utah and last year found himself in switzerland atop the legendary bec de rosses for the verbier xtreme. the 25-year old freeskier recently moved from salt lake city to seattle in pursuit of his big-mountain skiing ambitions. first descents from washington to the andes and freeskiing podiums in the us, france, switzerland, and russia have characterized his last few years, and his sponsors the north face, praxis skis, and smith are enthusiastic to support his future efforts. evan stevens click to see profile evan stevens has a seven-foot wingspan and ranks among the fewer than 60 ifmga mountain guides in the united states. from top-roping 5.7s in western mass and snow-plowing the slopes of killington as a youngster, to onsighting 5.12 in utah and leading guided tours from the wasatch to the chugach at the ripe young age of 31, evan has risen not only to a stellar reputation as an alpine expert, but to a spot on the board of directors at the american mountain guide association as well. when hes not bringing the fast and light yosemite alpine assault style to the mountains of greenland, he enjoys wearing out the dog and trying to keep up with his wife, jasmin. all we know is, if hes lagging behind her, she must be wonder woman in disguise. evan is sponsored by outdoor research,petzel, evolv, moment, and karhu. grete eliassen click to see profile grete eliassens gravy train rolls faster and deeper than a powder-heavy pnw storm system, but when you see the authority she displays in the park and witness her big-mountain balls, her success should be no surprise. eliassen took her first us open championship at the age of seventeen, and to date the 23-year-old norwegian has four us open wins, four x games medals, a european open championship, a nippon open championship, and seven film appearances under her belt. shes been voted both an ullr girl and fri flyt magazine skier of the decade, not to mention the countless cover shots, interviews, photo spreads and press hits that come along with dominating the circuit. pardon the expression, but holy shit. slow down, girl! these days, if shes not having another medal dangled round her neck, updating her blog or recovering from a brutal river-gap wreck, gretes working on her upcoming movie say my name and dedicating time to the womens sports foundation. her sponsors include oakley, nike 6.0, dakine, tecnica, head, swix,
