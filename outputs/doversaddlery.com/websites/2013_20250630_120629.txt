certified riding helmets a protective riding helmet that meets or exceeds astm international/sei standards is required by the united states equestrian federation, inc. for horse jumping events. a horseback riding helmet must fit well and all retention straps must be securely fastened. always follow the manufacturer's recommendations before applying cleaning agents, paints, or adhesives to an equestrian helmet. read an important notice about astm/sei certified helmets. choosing a riding helmet horse riding helmets are available in a variety of materials, sizes and colors. typical construction materials include polycarbonate, duratec, and plastic. many helmets and riding hats feature leather, suede and velvet styling. whatever your fashion, dover keeps you looking distinguished in the show ring and anytime you're in the saddle. when choosing a size, look for a riding helmet that fits snugly and securely. dover created this helpful guide to measuring your head for a riding helmet. while a helmet that is slightly too large may feel more comfortable, the helmet will become looser with wear, so avoid purchasing a helmet that is too big. contact dover 800-406-8204 live chat
