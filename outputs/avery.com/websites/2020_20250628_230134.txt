they also arrived pretty fast!!! very satisfied customer here! 5/5 stars they were fast, easy and i was very happy with the results. 5/5 stars this is the second time i have purchased from avery we print and my order was perfect and arrived quickly. for most projects i print my own labels because there are many changes, i.e. fragrance, size, ingredients since i do custom orders of bath & body products. however for my round labels, which never change, this is my best option rather than buying the round labels and printing them myself. 5/5 stars i have always trusted avery products. i've used them for many years. this was my first time using the printing service. all i can say is wow!! the printing was beautiful and i was quite surprised by the shipping. i didn't expect them so soon! i will most definitely use this service again! 5/5 stars great online design tools. excellent, fluid website. quick delivery. great price and product! 5/5 stars the quality of the labels was excellent, i chose my labels to be printed on the white film. the color of my images printed on the labels were bright and colorful just like i expected when i was reviewing the proofs online. i squeezed in multiple designs on two sheets to save cost and didn't seem to give avery printing house any problems...how do they do it ?! so impressed with avery weprint services...made me feel like i have my own professional print house. exceptional print quality low minimums—no setup fees free shipping over $50 * flat rate shipping offer applies to economy shipping only. free economy shipping offer applies to orders with a merchandise total of $50.00 or greater (after discounts, before shipping and tax). if another shipping method is selected, charges may apply. offer applies only to avery weprint orders shipped to the united states and puerto rico. offers subject to change.
