thank you for being in business!! 12/16/2012 thank you! thank you! i have been trying to find my husband’s boots for over a year now. he has very fussy feet and he loves the chippewa 6" steel toe hikers. i found you after trying a couple of other sites that said they had them but didn’t. my husband is a very happy man now. anna 5/10/2012 i received my corcoran 985 jump boots. they are the same boot i worn during my service days just as i had expected. i ordered these particular boots due to the fact that i recently dislocated my left ankle and was seeking the added ankle support. they are doing just that. my actual reason for this email is to inform you that i had interaction with two different customer service reps and my experience with them both was "outstanding" ! i wish i had made a note of their names but regretably i did not. hopefully you can access that data and thank them for me. also, i would like to think that you would commend them on their kindness and wonderful customer service. thanks again for a fine product. i have beat the hell out of them this first week and they are doing just dandy. respectfully frank johnson pennington gap, va 10/8/2012 my ariat "tombstone" boots in the rare all-chestnut brown (not listed on your web-site) in men's size 8 ee arrived yesterday; drop shipped from ariat (special order/ request). these boots are great. they slid right on and fit & felt like an old friend. the bootbay purchase experience via telephone order was superb. the order lady friendly, courteous and helpful. i'm sure i'll purchase another pair soon. i have a leather-soled, wide toe western boot dedicated for country dancing. my ariat tombstones will be my everyday, walking and motorcycling boots. warm regards aye, lindsay gow 10/5/2012 thank you!

i am very pleased with my boots, and even more pleased with the customer service at bootbay. thanks, bob m. 4/10/2012 i am writing this letter because i just received excellent customer service. this is my first pair of justin boots and i was being called to let know that the boots i ordered were on back order. the customer service lady was very pleasant and walked me through options that i had. at the end we ended up going with the same boot but in a different width that will end up being much more comfortable and a better fit. thank you for a great buying experience!
