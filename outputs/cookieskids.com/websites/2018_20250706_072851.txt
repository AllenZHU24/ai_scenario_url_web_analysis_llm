ship your order outside of the united states, we consider their u.s. address to be the destination for your order. once your package reaches that address safely, our responsibility for loss or damage to your order ends. we will not replace or refund any items or packages delivered to you from a freight forwarder. we recommend that you inspect the package upon delivery for any signs of visible damage. if damage is found, you should refuse the package. please instruct freight forwarders to do the same. any items lost after delivery to you or the freight forwarder will be your responsibility. the same policy applies to parcels shipped to a place of business where there is a delivery confirmation on record with the carrier we used to ship your package. order verification cookie's kids uses an address verification tool to protect our customers from fraud. our system compares the billing address you provide us with during checkout, to the billing address on record with your credit card issuer. if our system is unable to obtain a response, we will do one of the following two things: we will ask you for your credit/debit card issuing bank phone number. this phone number can be found on the back of your payment card. we will contact your bank to confirm your billing address with them. for international orders, and in some other cases, we use a method called the "small charge verification." the method works like this: we will charge a small sum to your credit card, less than $4.00 usd. this is separate from your actual purchase amount. you will need to check your credit card account to see how much was charged, and then email your order number with the amount to customerservice@cookieskids.com. you can also phone us at 1877-942-6654 or +001-347-689-0300. if your response matches the actual amount charged, we will ship your order and refund the small charge back to your account. international shipping cookie's is pleased to offer usps international shipping service. international orders take 7-14 business days to fulfill deliveries. shipping charges are based on the weight of the item(s) shipped to the country of destination. cookieskids services almost all destinations. please contact us if your country is not listed at checkout. for your convenience we provide online shipping charge calculations at the time you place your order and/or add an item to your shopping bag. duties, customs and vat: international orders are subject to duties, customs and value added taxes. these charges must be paid upon receipt of your order. be sure to verify the additional cost you may incur with the authorities of the country the order is being shipped to. brands we cannot ship internationally: due to agreements cookieskids.com has with some manufacturers, we cannot ship these brands internationally: the north face levi's u.s. polo assn. prices: all prices are quoted and charged in u.s. dollars. tax policies taxes will be assessed based on state and
