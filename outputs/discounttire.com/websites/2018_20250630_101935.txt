how long do tires last? the average life of a tire is determined by the conditions a tire is exposed to throughout its life - not measured in calendar years. temperature changes, sun exposure, storage conditions, usage, and maintenance schedules all contribute to the rate at which a tire ages. it is impossible to determine a tire’s exact life expectancy, because there is no way to account for the level of influence any one of these factors may have on a tire. however, you can defer to the vehicle and tire manufacturers replacement recommendations: vehicle manufacturers recommend tire replacement at 6 years tire manufacturers' warranties expire at 6 years tire manufacturers recommend replacement at 10 years, regardless of tread 	depth discount tire recommends that you replace your tires after 6 years of age, regardless of tread depth. for your safety, discount tire will not service a tire that exceeds 10 years of age to find the age of your tire, you can refer to your tire’s dot identification number, which is stamped on the tire’s sidewall. the last four digits of this number indicate the week and year the tire was built. tire aging process tires contain anti-aging properties that are mixed into their rubber compounds. tires contain anti-ozonants that help the rubber stay soft, flexible, and conducive to grip. over time, air begins to permeate the tire wall and weaken the integrity of the tire’s structure; causing the tire’s flexible structure to become brittle and lose strength. this deterioration process is known as oxidation, since oxygen serves as the catalyst of decay. in addition to the degradation caused by the permeation of air and oxygen particles, other factors can cause tires to lose their gripping power and overall effectiveness. research conducted by the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) maintains that tires age more rapidly in heat. warm climates and exposure to direct sunlight can speed up the aging process by accelerating oxidation. therefore, the tires equipped on vehicles that are stored outdoors, such as trailers or rvs, will age faster than tires on vehicles stored in a garage. tires will also age faster if they are improperly cared for or are abused. if tires are driven while overinflated or underinflated, internal damage could occur that may not be detected through visual inspection. impacts, punctures, and improper tire repairs may also cause damage that could permanently decrease the life of tires. these occurrences weaken their integrity and contribute to premature aging. to reduce these risks, make sure your tires are correctly inflated, regularly maintained, and treated with respect. less than 6 years old: these tires should deliver dependable performance, but treadwear may change traction capabilities in adverse weather conditions. for maintenance, you should perform a monthly inspection which includes an air pressure check. rotate every 6,000 – 8,000 miles, and balance every 12,000 – 16,000 miles. avoid extreme heat. 6-10 years old: if you have improperly maintained tires, they will likely reach the end of their service life at or before 6-10 years. tires of this age may be more worn and possibly have less tread, reducing traction, stability, and puncture resistance in all weather conditions. they may also face an increased risk of cracking or structural changes caused by environmental exposure. for maintenance, you should perform a monthly air pressure check and increase the frequency of inspections. replacements are recommended at this stage. over 10 years old: any tires over ten years old are too weak to ensure safe driving. at this age, it is imperative that you replace your tires. discount tire will not service any tires older than ten years. when should i replace my old tires? if you commute or drive frequently, you may wear out your tire tread before the rubber deteriorates. logging over 12,000 miles per year, an average rate for an american driver, may wear tread down to an unusable level within 3-4 years. this regular level of use may necessitate replacement before age and environmental exposure could compromise the rubber compound’s integrity. advancements in tread life have made tire aging a more pertinent issue. some of today’s most advanced tires have a 90,000 mile treadwear warranty. if equipped on vehicles only driven infrequently, these tires may require replacement before the tread wears completely down. tires on intermittently used rvs, driven exclusively on weekends, or collector vehicles all face an increased risk of accelerated aging. be prepared to replace these tires within 6-10 years, no matter how much remaining tread they possess. unfortunately, variables and lack of visual signs of deterioration make it difficult to more precisely determine when your aged tires need replacement. some automakers assert that tires be replaced as soon as they become six years old. tire experts contend that tires – if properly stored and cared for – can last anywhere from 6-10 years. you must decide exactly when to replace your aged tires based on a variety of individual factors. mileage, condition, and maintenance received all contribute to the tire’s safety and usability. you should replace tires if you think one of these factors may have compromised the tire’s integrity. if you are unsure about what to do, come to discount tire for expert analysis and recommendations. extending the life of your tires in order to ensure maximum tire life, it is important to have your tire maintenance performed regularly. follow these steps to improve the life of your tires: check your tire inflation pressure every 3,000 miles. this will not only 	extend the life of your tires but also help with vehicle handling, 	acceleration/deceleration and fuel efficiency rotate your tires every 6,000 - 8,000 miles to promote even treadwear get your wheel alignment checked, as specified in your vehicle's owner's 	manual, or if you begin to feel the vehicle "pull” to any one side 	or the other check your tires regularly for any road debris or damage inspect your tires for any irregularities in treadwear, as these could 	indicate problems with your vehicles alignment or inflation be sure not to exceed a tire’s maximum load capacity, as this puts 	excessive pressure on your tires if you need to replace your tires as soon as possible, we can provide payment arrangements through our credit card — offered in partnership with synchrony financial. if ever you're not satisfied please feel free to bring it back fast & friendly service on every order, every day shop tire search wheel search services deals and rebates fleet financing credit apply now commercial payments company bruce halle's legacy our story motorsports careers tips & guides tire safety tire size calculator check tire pressure more topics... customer care customer care store locator appointments return policy contact regional offices contact us connect with us © 2019 the reinalt-thomas corporation. all rights reserved. privacy policysite map
