always consult your vehicle owner’s manual as well as tire manufacturer's 	literature for specific information as to vehicle/tire performance. the intent 	of discount tire is to supplement and not supersede this material. in the 	event of a conflict in the materials, you should always rely upon the 	recommendations of your vehicle and tire manufacturers. know your numbers at discount tire, our first consideration is the safety of our customers. when 	it comes to driving your vehicle, there are several variables that can affect 	your safety. road conditions, adverse weather and driving behaviors are a few 	that can compromise your overall safety, but your tires also play a role. of all the safety features on your vehicle such as anti-lock brakes, traction 	control, and all-wheel drive systems, your tires are one of the most 	important. your tires are the only thing that connect your vehicle to the 	road, so it makes sense that they play such a major role in your safety on the 	road. before you hit the road, it is important that your tires are properly 	maintained and are in good working condition. the more you know and understand 	about your tire’s health, the better off you will be when driving your 	vehicle. there are 4 main factors when it comes to the health of your tires: 	tread depth, tire age, tire inflation/load, and keeping up with routine 	maintenance. tread depth safety tread depth refers to the amount of tread remaining on a tire. this is 	calculated by measuring the distance between the top of the tread block to the 	bottom of the tread void. this number is normally displayed in 32nds of an 	inch, but can also be measured in millimeters. the amount of tread remaining 	on a tire impacts handling, traction, and stopping distance. as a tire wears 	and the tread depth is reduced, these characteristics begin to diminish. this 	effect is amplified when driving in adverse conditions such as wet or slick 	roads. as you can see on the stopping distance chart, tread depth effects how well 	your vehicle can stop, especially on wet roads. it is very important to be 	aware of how much remaining tread is on all of your tires and how it impacts 	you. in 2012, the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) released a 	study directly correlating low tread depth with an increased likelihood of 	being involved in an accident. discount tire and industry standards recommend 	replacing tires worn down to 4/32” and below, and will not service tires worn 	to 2/32” and below. *the michelin premier tire line does not follow the stopping distance 	portion of the above image as it contains technology that allows it to perform 	like a new tire all the way down to 2/32nds. learn more about measuring tread depth tire aging safety the age of your tires is another important consideration when it comes to your 	tire’s safety. when it comes to tire aging, it is very simple: the older the 	tires are, the higher the risk for failure. a 	publication from the american chemical society: rubber division, released 	in 2008, states how an aged tire has reduced crack growth resistance, which 	can lead to an increased rate of tire failure. tires are made of rubber, which over time begins to break down. as a tire 	ages, oxygen penetrates the rubber causing the rubber to start breaking down 	on a molecular level. the rubber begins to become harder and more brittle, 	losing its elasticity and strength. after a point, the tire’s ability to carry 	weight is reduced and it could potentially fail. even if a tire has never been 	put into service or has very little use, it has still been exposed to time and 	elements causing its integrity to be compromised. the age of your tire can be determined by the dot number stamped on the 	sidewall of every tire produced for street use. nhtsa has conducted studies on 	tire aging and released findings showing a link between tire aging and the 	increased chances of tire failure. most tire and automobile manufacturers 	recommend replacing your tires between 6 and 10 years. at discount tire, we 	recommend replacing any tire that is 6 years or more past the date of 	manufacture, and will not service tires that are 10 years or more past the 	date of manufacture. learn more about tire aging read a study conducted by the nhtsa on tire aging read nhtsa's report to congress on tire aging tire inflation safety and load capacity a properly inflated tire is equally important when it comes to tire safety. as 	documented by the rubber manufacturer association (rma) and nhtsa, an 	under-inflated tire increases the chance of tire failure. a tire must be able 	to hold the weight of not only the vehicle, but also any additional load the 	vehicle might be carrying such as fuel, passengers, and payload. a tire alone 	does not have the strength to support this. as air pressure builds inside the 	tire, the sidewalls gain strength and with the proper air pressure, it can now 	support the vehicle safely. an under-inflated tire lacks the ability to support the vehicle and quickly 	becomes compromised. the rubber manufacturers association (rma) released a publication 	showing that driving on an under-inflated tire will begin to generate excess 	heat causing the rubber to break down. eventually the tire will no longer be 	able to withstand the excess load and fail. it is very important that you 	check your air pressure often to prevent driving on under-inflated tires. all 	vehicles from 2008 to current come equipped with a tire pressure monitor 	system (tpms) to help monitor air pressure and alert the driver if the 	pressure falls 25% or more of the manufacturers recommended inflation. discount tire recommends you refer to your owners manual or vehicle placard to 	find the correct tire inflation for your vehicle. learn more about correct air pressure read up on nhtsa's tire pressure study tread depth analysis routine tire maintenance proper and timely tire maintenance is crucial to safety. all of the tires on 	your vehicle should be inspected, inflated, and rotated on a routine basis. inspect your tires every month. inspecting your tires will help identify 	any damage or conditions that might impede your safety. by evaluating the 	remaining tread, the tire's age, and overall condition, you can eliminate 	preventable risks that could potentially lead to an accident. 	 check your air pressure every month. inflating your tires will ensure they 	have the proper air pressure to sustain the weight of your vehicle. as 	mentioned before, an under-inflated tire highly increases the chance of tire 	failure. 	 rotate your tires every 6000-8000 miles. rotating your tires helps prolong 	tread life, thus maximizing the handling, traction, and stopping capabilities 	of your tires. this also requires removing the tire from the vehicle which 	allows for a more thorough tire inspection. browse tires if you have any questions or need any
