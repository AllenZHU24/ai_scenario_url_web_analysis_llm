(learn more about valve stems.) you need to remove the valve cap from the stem to check the tire pressure; after you unscrew it, take a moment to inspect it. check the valve cap for cracking. most valve caps will have a rubber grommet inside the cap to create a tight seal. if this rubber seal is cracked or missing, replace the valve cap as soon as possible. 4: use a dependable air gauge to get the reading be sure to use a quality air gauge that will consistently provide correct readings. for convenience, we recommend buying one and keeping it in your vehicle. your own gauge will likely provide more accurate readings than those at gas stations, car washes, and other public locations, as those can become inaccurate due to age, exposure, or abuse. you can choose a traditional gauge with a meter, a pencil-type gauge, or a battery-powered digital gauge. any of these options can provide you with reliable readings. firmly place the gauge’s exposed end onto the valve stem. if you hear a hissing sound after you place it on the valve stem, it is not centered correctly. adjust your gauge to stop the hissing sound and get an accurate reading. then compare the reading to the vehicle’s recommended pressure to determine if you need to adjust the tire’s pressure. 5: adjust your air pressure if you have determined a tire to be low on air (underinflated), filling it is fairly easy provided you have access to an air compressor like those found at many gas stations. with the compressor on, simply push the nozzle at the end of the air-hose on your valve stem to begin filling the tire with air. like with the pressure gauge, if you hear a hissing sound, it is not centered correctly. when the hose is properly centered on the valve stem, you’ll hear your tire inflating. note: as with public air gauges, keep in mind that public air compressors are often neglected or abused and may be difficult to properly inflate your tires. on the other hand, if you have determined a tire is overinflated (a higher than recommended reading), simply depress the small brass needle in the valve stem to partially deflate (release air from) the tire. most air pressure gauges have a protruded area reverse of the exposed end to make deflation easy. 6: recheck air pressure and reinstall the valve cap you’ll need to recheck the air pressure during adjustment to ensure your tires are filled to the recommended level. lastly, always remember to reinstall the valve cap after you have finished checking or adjusting the air pressure. complimentary air pressure checks at discount tire if you are having difficulty or prefer assistance with checking your tires’ pressure, stop by your local discount tire and take advantage of our complimentary air checks. for more information on this and other tire and wheel services, check out our youtube channel or reach out to us on twitter, facebook and instagram. shop tire search wheel search services deals and rebates fleet mobile app financing credit apply now commercial payments company bruce halle's legacy our story motorsports careers blog in the news tips and guides tire safety tire size calculator check tire pressure more topics... customer care customer care store locator appointments return policy covid-19 update contact regional offices faq community contact us connect with us © 2021 the reinalt-thomas corporation. all rights reserved. privacy policy ccpa notice accessibility site map
