"mr. g.", as everyone knew him, was born in 1914 in a small farming community in southern indiana. at age 3, he lost his leg to infection. after crutching to school and around the farm for 10 years, he received his first prosthetic leg. it was at that point in time he decided to dedicate his life to prosthetic manufacturing and to assisting those with medical needs. in the late 1930s, he moved to michigan and continued working in the medical field. in 1957, he opened his first store in pontiac, michigan, which has remained open to this very day. over 50 years later, we are proud to carry on his tradition of assisting those needing healthcare products. through the power of the internet, we have been able to not only carry on his legacy, but to expand it with the creation of alevastores.com and many exciting new sites "powered by alevastores.com".  we now serve over 1,000 customers daily and are quickly becoming one of the most respected healthcare product and internet retailers in the industry. "mr. g." recently passed away at the age of 94. he is greatly missed by us all, but we know he is looking down and smiling upon all he's created. today, his legacy is carried on by his son, larry gaskins (chief financial officer), and his grandson, derek gaskins (president & ceo). larry, derek and the rest of the alevastores.com team want to thank you for visiting our site and for choosing us for your home health and wellness product needs. our philosophy our philosophy here at alevastores.com is to provide a "fresh idea on shopping".  what does that mean? well, it's really quite simple. over the past decade, we have noticed a unique phenomenon with many online retailers, particularly websites selling home health and wellness products. they've turned into difficult to navigate mega malls! your health and wellness is too important to rely on the expertise of these "mega" sites and the limited knowledge of the phone jockeys on the other end of the line. so, how is alevastores.com changing that you ask? we have been developing niche websites focusing on niche healthcare product lines for the past five years. our websites don't have hundreds of categories with hundreds of thousands of products. they have concise, easy to navigate categories with products we have researched, tested and found to be truly worthy of the alevastores.com stamp. more importantly, each site has a dedicated, fully trained team on the other end of the line prepared to assist you with your shopping needs. when you purchase from a website powered by alevastores.com, you can trust you are receiving not only a quality product, but the right product. if it isn't, you can take advantage of our 180-day return policy and we'll do our best to make it right. our vision here at alevastores.com, we plan to continue identifying unique product offerings and launching targeted retail websites for you, our valued customer. we are always looking for the next great product to offer our customers and always welcome the feedback of our valued customers.  if you have an idea for us, shoot us an email here.  however, we refuse to compromise quality or service. *we currently fill well over 99% of orders within 1 business day and continually invest in our fulfillment operations to ensure this unparalleled service continues. *not only is our shipping fast, but its always free!
