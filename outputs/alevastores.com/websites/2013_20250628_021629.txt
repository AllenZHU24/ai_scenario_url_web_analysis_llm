"mr. g.", as everyone knew him, was born in 1914 in a small farming community in southern indiana. at age 3, he lost his leg to infection. after crutching to school and around the farm for 10 years, he received his first prosthetic leg. it was at that point in time he decided to dedicate his life to prosthetic manufacturing and to assisting those with medical needs. in the late 1930s, he moved to michigan and continued working in the medical field. in 1957, he opened his first store in pontiac, michigan, which has remained open to this very day. over 50 years later, we are proud to carry on his tradition of assisting those needing healthcare products. through the power of the internet, we have been able to not only carry on his legacy, but to expand it with the creation of alevastores.com and many exciting new sites "powered by alevastores.com". we now serve over 1,000 customers daily and are quickly becoming one of the most respected healthcare product and internet retailers in the industry. "mr. g." recently passed away at the age of 94. he is greatly missed by us all, but we know he is looking down and smiling upon all he's created. today, his legacy is carried on by his son, larry gaskins (chief financial officer), and his grandson, derek gaskins (president & ceo). larry, derek and the rest of the alevastores.com  team want to thank you for visiting our site and for choosing us for your home health and wellness product needs. have a question? call us toll-free 877-846-4600 email-- support@alevastores.com hours-- monday - friday 9:00am to 5:30pm est saturday 10:00am to 1:00pm est contact us dial us: 877-846-4600 email: support@alevastores.com1840 enterprise drive rochester hills, mi 48309 customer service about usreturn policyshipping policyprivacy policypayment optionsautoship program we accept follow us twitterfacebooklinked inwordpress © copyright 2010 alevastores.com. all rights reserved.
