ten children on a small farm in southern indiana. at the tender age of three, mr. g, as we came to know him, lost his leg to an infection. he used crutches every day for ten years as he tended to his daily chores and traveled to and from school. with guidance from his parents and their tight-knit, humble community, he developed a can-do attitude and kind, adventurous spirit. after being fit for his first prosthetic as a young man, he chose to dedicate his life to helping others in need of quality prosthetics. in the late 1930s, joseph moved to michigan and by 1957, had opened a small prosthetic fabrication business in pontiac, michigan. nearly 60 years later, that first venture has grown to become the aleva family of brands where his son larry, grandson derek and their wonderful staff carry on his legacy. mr. g taught us the importance of humility, compassion and a positive attitude. these characteristics have been instilled in each generation of our aleva family and continually yield opportunities for us to learn and grow while always placing the customer first. he is greatly missed by us all, but we know he is smiling down on us as we continue in his humble
