mack weldon is about the fusion between old-school quality and modern day technology. during our brand creation, we discovered weldon, an early 20th century underwear company in both marketing and product design - very similar to the brand we were creating. we embraced the name, flipped it a bit and made it ours. what's the difference? it’s all about the fabric and construction. we use lenzing modal® (made of 100% natural beechwood) which is anti-microbial (prevents odor), manages moisture and keeps you cool. when blended with cotton it actually creates a softer, more luxurious feel.  seams are designed to stretch and recover, and we use different materials to keep you comfortable where it counts (18-hour jersey, micro pique cool zones, stretch rib between legs). the 18-hour jersey our signature blend of long staple cotton, lenzing modal and lycra, is our choice for all undershirts and classic underwear styles. the result? we believe it’s simply the softest most comfortable underwear on the market today. to ensure the least amount of garment shrinkage, the fabric is allowed to rest peacefully, unrolled for 18 hours before cutting and sewing. daily performance wear mack weldon is designed "for daily wear" but many of our wearers loved how the product performed in the gym and on the court. it's meant to fit close to the body, but never tight or restrictive so it's a good balance of compression and long-term comfort. as for the undershirts, the cotton/modal blend wicks moisture and keeps everything cool on hot days. so, while not designed specifically to wear for sport, it's nice to know that you can. labels on the outside when designing the line, we were inspired by some vintage military issue product that had print on the outside of the garment for easy sorting and identification by the wearer. so there is some purpose there that we thought was unique/relevant. also, we didn't want the lettering to come between your skin and the soft 18-hour jersey. where is mack weldon made? mack weldon is designed in new york and our warehouse and fulfillment center is in massachusetts. our gear is manufactured and sourced in wrap certified factories across the globe - primarily thailand and peru. wrap is an independent, objective, non-profit team of global social compliance experts dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane, and ethical manufacturing around the world through certification and education. the factories are also iso certified with high quality management systems, ensuring that our products are manufactured in the best way possible to create outstanding results. how does the try on guarantee work?
