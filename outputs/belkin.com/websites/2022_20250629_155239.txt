magsafe is a magnetic technology from apple, built into the internal engineering of iphone 12 models. originally created as a safety feature for macbook charging cords, magsafe was incorporated into the iphone 12 to create a new ecosystem of accessories for easy attachment and faster wireless charging. how does magsafe work? magsafe is a series of magnets placed around the iphone 12’s internal charging coil, which senses other magsafe compatible accessories and snaps seamlessly and securely into place. magsafe will only attach to other compatible magsafe accessories, so there’s no need to worry about other magnets interfering or getting stuck to your phone. why should i get magsafe chargers and accessories? having a magsafe charger and other accessories will give you full use of iphone 12’s features and create new experiences at the same time. while your new iphone will still work with other qi-enabled wireless chargers, chargers with magsafe can deliver faster wireless charging up to 15w when locked in with an iphone 12, where other wireless chargers deliver up to 7.5w. that means you’ll spend less time charging, and the perfectly aligned snap-on attachment eliminates the worry that your phone might not charge fully if it vibrates with an incoming call. aside from simplified and enhanced wireless charging, the magsafe snap-on attachment creates exciting accessories such as magnetic car vent and fitness mounts, face motion trackers and power banks to widen the experience with the iphone 12 and make life simpler and more precise. what’s the difference between “made for magsafe” and “magsafe compatible”? our accessories that are built “with magsafe” have the official magsafe technology from apple inside them. such products will be marked with a “made for magsafe” badge, which means they have been developed and rigorously tested to mfi guidelines and optimized for iphone 12, and wireless chargers with magsafe can charge faster at up to 15w. our other magnetic accessories that are “magsafe compatible” meet industry standards and still provide the convenience and precision of snap-on attachment with a magnetic ring, but don’t have the official magsafe technology inside, so wireless chargers will only charge at 7.5w. these products are held to our highest standards and designed with consumer in mind completely safe to use with your iphone 12 models. why choose belkin for magsafe chargers and accessories? we’ve worked hand in hand with apple for years creating mfi certified accessories for iphone, macbook, airpods and more. at belkin, we truly understand the excitement of a new apple device and know how to create accessories that enhance that feeling and fit seamlessly into your life with elevated design and cutting-edge engineering. we are the first third party brand to create magsafe accessories such as the boostcharge pro 3-in-1 wireless charger with magsafe and boostcharge pro 2-in-1 wireless charger with magsafe. we are excited to bring you many more magsafe accessories for the iphone 12 and beyond. magsafe accessories best seller + quick add boostcharge pro 3-in-1 wireless charger with magsafe 15w $149.99 add to cart view details magsafe iphone mount with magsafe for mac notebooks $29.99 view details best seller + quick add boostcharge pro 3-in-1 wireless charging pad with magsafe $149.99 add to cart + quick add boostcharge pro 2-in-1 wireless charger stand with magsafe 15w $99.99 add to cart magnetic accessories + quick add magnetic fitness phone mount $34.99 add to cart + quick add magnetic phone mount with face tracking $69.99 add to cart + quick add boostcharge magnetic portable wireless charger pad 7.5w $19.99 - $29.99 add to cart + quick add boostcharge magnetic wireless charger stand 7.5w $24.99 - $34.99 add to cart sale view details boostcharge magnetic wireless power bank 2.5k price reduced from $49.99 to $39.99 view details account sign up/sign in support support center register your product product recalls connected equipment warranty company about us contact us newsroom careers sustainability where to buy partners affiliates partner advantage program connect with belkin find out more about news & offers sign up thank you stay tuned for exclusive offers, exciting new products and more. send me emails on the following topics: sign me up! send me all belkin updates and special offers (select all) apple device accessories samsung and android device accessories wemo | smart home technology | home automation network accessories exclusive offers & promotions small business new product launches speakers & headphones submit belkin will not sell or rent your email address. check out our privacy policy if youd like to learn more. thank you! your selection has been submitted. © belkin 2022  |  all rights reserved | legal & privacy united states change region your location australia china 香港 hong kong india japan korea malaysia philippines singapore thailand france germany italy netherlands spain united kingdom united states your regions asia pacific europe north america save remove product?
