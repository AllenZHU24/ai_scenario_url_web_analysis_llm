or other indicator. it's important to note that not all devices are compatible with all wireless chargers, so check your device's specifications to ensure compatibility with the charger and the

works through two coils, one in the charger and one in the device, that create an electromagnetic field. most wireless chargers use magsafe, qi or qi2 modules. compatibility, charging speeds and other features vary based on the wireless charging technology. how do wireless charging stands work? wireless charging stands are similar to charging pads, but hold the device at an angle so it can be viewed while it charges. they work by using inductive charging, which transfers energy wirelessly from the charger to the device being charged. the charger contains a coil of wire that creates an electromagnetic field, and the device being charged contains a coil that picks up this field to charge the battery. most charging stands use the qi standard, which optimizes the charging process by adjusting power and speed, and the device can be used and viewed while it charges. does my iphone have wireless charging? most modern iphones come with wireless charging capabilities. here’s a quick
