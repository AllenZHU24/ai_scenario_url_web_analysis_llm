based on location and growing zone.enter your zip to see a calendar for your area: how to sow sunflowers sow outdoors after danger of frost. sunflowers produce rather large seedlings and prefer to grow where sown. to insure good germination, sow seeds 1/2" deep in groups of 2 or 3 seeds. space these groups 2 to 4" apart. how to grow sunflowers sunflowers face the sun, so it's very important that your planting be made in an open, bright spot in your garden. the tall varieties will cast a shadow on other plants, so make sure all tall varieties are planted on the north end of your garden. a light, dry, well-drained soil is preferred. under normal conditions, no fertilizer is needed unless the soil is poor. if this is the case, the use of 5 pounds of 5-10-5 complete fertilizer per 100 sq. ft. should be sufficient. harvesting sunflower seeds edible kinds will mature in about 3 months or more after sowing. heads are cut off after the stalks are quite dry but before fall or winter rains come. check the flower heads for maturity to see if the florets in the center of the flower disk have shriveled and the back of the flower head is turning yellow, or the head is starting to droop. cut flower-heads with a foot of the stalk attached. hang heads in a warm, dry, well-ventilated place so the seeds may fully ripen and dry. cheesecloth, netting or a paper bag with holes punched in for ventilation should be placed over the head to protect the seeds and to collect those that may drop from drying. we also suggest these gardening products and ideas. quick view sea magic organic growth
