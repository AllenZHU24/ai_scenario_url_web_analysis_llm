soil testing growing calendar question and answer gardening tip of the day with the heat on for the winter, houseplants will dry out much more quickly than at other times of the year. diligently check for pests that attack humidity and moisture stressed plants. such pests include spider mite, mealy bugs, and whiteflies. spray with insecticidal soaps or pyrethrins according to label directions. to create a happier, healthier environment for the plants try the following: cluster plants to create groups. this helps maintain better humidity around the plants and creates a more tropical look. to improve humidity, fill a tray or shallow pan with 1 inch of pebbles and add water to just below the top of the pebbles. use a cool air humidifier. it benefits both plants and people! occasionally give your plants a shower. wrap the top of the pot in plastic wrap (to avoid soil spilling out) and shower for several minutes using room temperature water. this is great for removing dust buildup as well as rinsing off pest such as aphids. growing calendar growing calendars are based on location and growing zone. enter your zip to see a calendar for your area: recently viewed items (what is this?)
