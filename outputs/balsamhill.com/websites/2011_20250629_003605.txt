(if you are looking for a space saving tree, we recommend our fifth avenue flatback tree, which is designed to look like a full tree while only taking up half the space.) we're here to help call 1.888.55.balsam or contact us at customerservice@balsamhill.com receive exclusive offers view newsletter sample » stay connected shop trees wreaths & garlands christmas decorations clearance sale about balsam hill® about us the balsam hill difference ® media inquiries in the news corporate philanthropy safety balsam hill united kingdom customer service contact us faq warranty information return info order tracking shipping information international shipping information terms & privacy policy site map more christmas tree buyer's guide balsam hill blog balsam hill video branch sample kit christmas tree assembly guides artificial christmas trees | prelit artificial christmas trees | christmas wreaths | white christmas trees balsam hill canada | garlands | artificial christmas tree sale | balsam hill video channel | balsam hill light assembly guides * shipping outside the continental 48 united states and over-sized items requiring truck shipping will incur additional shipping fees. copyright © 2011 balsam hill ® all rights reserved.
