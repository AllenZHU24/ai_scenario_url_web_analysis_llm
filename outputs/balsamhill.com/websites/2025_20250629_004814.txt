guidechoosing an artificial christmas tree: the ultimate buyer’s guideupdated last feb. 13, 2025christmas trees play a big part in our favorite holiday traditions. we gather around them with friends and family to decorate, open gifts, and celebrate. when considering how to choose an artificial christmas tree, it’s essential to pick one that suits your style and lasts for many seasons. this guide will help you make the right choice for your home, whether you’re looking for artificial christmas trees with lights or skinny christmas trees for limited spaces.what artificial christmas tree size and shape should i get?christmas tree sizes come in different heights and shapes. to narrow your options, you need to decide where to put your christmas tree. this will help you determine if you have the space for big christmas trees or if smaller ones are more appropriate.christmas tree height guidea good rule of thumb is to have at least 6 inches between the top of your tree and the ceiling. this also accounts for a topper or any decorative stand that adds height to the tree. so, if you have the standard 9-foot ceiling and a 12-inch topper, you’d want a 7.5-foot christmas tree. we measure our trees from the stand to the topmost tip.tree height best for under 6 feethomes with limited space 6 to 6.5 feet areas with low ceilings 7 to 7.5 feet rooms with standard 8- to 9-foot ceilings8 to

how much room it takes up. go for a narrow or slim christmas tree for limited spaces and a wide, full-sized one if you have a spacious area. calculate your available floor space and check it against
