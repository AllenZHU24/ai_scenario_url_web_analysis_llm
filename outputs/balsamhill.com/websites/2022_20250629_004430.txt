high-quality, realistic artificial christmas trees about balsam hill™ imagine christmas morning as you and your family are gathered around your balsam hill™ christmas tree. children are giggling with excitement and happiness while the adults are sharing memories and laughing together, enjoying this special family time. you look at your tree, and although it has been decorated and displayed since thanksgiving, it's the perfect shade of green, not a needle lies on the floor, and it looks so realistic that no one can believe that it is not a real tree. you smile and feel relaxed as you think about how easy it was to set up your tree, the welcome absence of sticky sap and needles throughout the house, and the stunning, realistic look that has brightened up the living room for over a month. this is the holiday experience we hope to provide year after year through our luxurious, lifelike christmas trees. at balsam hill™, we are committed to creating the best christmas trees on the market. our founder, mac harman, was inspired to start balsam hill by a family member who was allergic to live trees but wanted to create a festive atmosphere in his home during the holidays. when mac's search for a lifelike artificial christmas tree came up empty-handed, our mission was born to develop the most realistic and luxurious artificial trees. to accomplish this mission, our designers carefully craft our trees to mimic nature using site visits and cuttings from live trees as their guides. a messagefromour founder “we founded balsam hill™ with the simple goal of creating the world's finest artisan christmas trees. we are humbled and honored to receive so many public accolades for our products; yet we are most appreciative of the praise from thousands of our customers. i hope balsam hill will also win your praise this holiday season.” — mac harman,founder & ceo see media mentions » view a video of our trees » shop trees » about our christmas trees just how real are our trees? they are routinely used by set designers of popular tv shows and even have been known to fool one of america's most savvy tv hosts into commenting on air about the "live" trees on her set. they routinely grace the lobbies of fine hotels and embassies around the world, and are used in macy's famous santaland exhibit in new york city. fine retailers rely on us throughout the spring and summer to provide gorgeous, lifelike trees as backdrops for their holiday photoshoots for their upcoming catalogs and advertisements. but don't take our word for it - we encourage you to listen to what lester holt and ann curry had to say about them on nbc's the today show. we have also been honored by the good housekeeping research institute whose expert panel named our bh balsam fir™ the "best overall" artificial christmas tree. most importantly, our customers express their satisfaction with the trees they have chosen to be a part of their annual holiday traditions. our full product line is
