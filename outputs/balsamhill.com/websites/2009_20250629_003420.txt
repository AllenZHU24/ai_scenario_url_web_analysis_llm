they are routinely used by set designers of popular tv shows and even have been known to fool one of america's most savvy tv hosts into commenting on air about the "live" trees on her set. they routinely grace the lobbies of fine hotels and embassies around the world, and are used in macy's famous santaland exhibit in new york city. fine retailers rely on us throughout the spring and summer to provide gorgeous, lifelike trees as backdrops for their holiday photoshoots for their upcoming catalogs and advertisements. but don't take our word for it – we encourage you to listen to what lester holt and ann curry had to say about them on nbc's the today show. we have also been honored by the good housekeeping research institute whose expert panel named our bh balsam fir ® the "best overall" artificial christmas tree. most importantly, our customers express their satisfaction with the trees they have chosen to be a part of their annual holiday traditions. our full product line is available for purchase exclusively through our website. to allow you to experience the true realism of our products from the comfort of your own home, we invite you to order our branch sample kit. this kit includes true needle™ sample branches from each of our signature collection trees as well as branch samples from many of our traditional artificial trees in our classics collection. at balsam hill ®, we strive for excellence in all that we do. whether it's developing product innovations such as our ultra-realistic true needle® branches and our unique color+clear ® or candlelight led lights, or providing our super-zoom photos so you can view your favorite trees in great detail before your purchase, our goal is for you to enjoy a picture perfect, hassle-free christmas. company information shop need assistance?
