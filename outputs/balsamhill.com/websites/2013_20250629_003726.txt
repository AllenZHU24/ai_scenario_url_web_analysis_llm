yolanda (haiyan) relief on november 8, 2013, typhoon yolanda struck the philippines leaving a wake of devastation in its path, displacing over 500,000, and leaving thousands dead. our hearts go out to all the victims of this catastrophic storm. for balsam hill, typhoon yolanda struck particularly close to home not just because of the magnitude but because many of our team members live in the philippines or are of filipino heritage. the balsam hill team quickly mobilized to help in the aftermath of the storm, dispatching a team from the united states to join our team in the philippines in the relief effort. our team is leading a private effort airlifting supplies to families most in need and furthest from the areas of international aid efforts. balsam hill hopes that you will join us in support of the relief and rebuilding effort in the philippines. if you are looking for a charity to which you may donate funds, here is one that comes highly recommended by our team on the ground in the philippines: https://www.facebook.com/pages/negrense-volunteers-for-change/132828936758769. spark apprenticeships balsam hill shares the holiday spirit with at-risk middle school students by sponsoring student apprentices through spark, a local bay area charity. working on projects alongside balsam hill employees, the student apprentices get hands-on experience working on projects related to their dream jobs. recently, balsam hill employees led the students in various projects, ranging from graphic design to online merchandising to business operations. education is one of the most valuable gifts one can receive, and as a christmas company, it has been a joy to be able to present the students with that gift through our experiences and skills. at balsam hill, we value the generosity of spirit and hope that is represented by christmas. we feel privileged to have gotten the opportunity to touch young lives. spark who we are in the united states, over a third of all young people drop out of high school without a diploma, permanently limiting their options in life. spark is an award-winning non-profit with a powerful answer to this crisis, addressing it early – in middle-school – and with a unique apprenticeship program. through spark, at-risk middle-school students can try a range of career options after-school, working one-on-one with mentors in professions ranging from computer engineering to dentistry, and law to architecture. spark has shown that students who do apprenticeships are less likely to drop out, more engaged in school, and more able to actively set the course of their lives through education and into the workforce. our programs spark works with companies of all sizes, offering engaging volunteer opportunities for employees to become mentors and introduce local students to their profession. balsam hill has worked with several spark students in fields including graphic design, website design, and business operations. the apprenticeship is a uniquely powerful learning experience, where students gain insight into a career and workplace they never would have access to otherwise, one that vividly demonstrates the doors that a good education can open. for expert advice call 1.888.55.balsam or email us » receive exclusive offers view newsletter sample » stay connected shop trees corporate sales christmas tree buyer's
