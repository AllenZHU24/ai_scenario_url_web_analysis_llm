decade, balsam hill has been spreading christmas cheer to families around the world with their highly-realistic artificial christmas trees and holiday décor. for more than 3.5 million spectators and more than 50 million viewers nationwide, the macy’s parade signifies the beginning of the holiday season and balsam hill is proud to be part of such a long-standing tradition. “since our inception, it was our intention to be a long-standing holiday tradition that families around the world welcome into their home. after a decade we can now realize that dream and join the float family of one of our world’s most beloved holiday traditions that millions welcome into their home, as they tune in to watch the macy’s thanksgiving day parade.” thomas harman, ceo of balsam brands, said. “what people are going to see coming down the parade route on thanksgiving is an exceptional float. it is perfect for the macy’s thanksgiving day parade,” said amy kule, executive producer of macy’s thanksgiving day parade. she added, “balsam hill, to me, is about family celebration – and this is a family celebration...balsam hill tells that story.” standing over 30 feet tall, balsam hill’s “deck the halls” float embodies all that is christmas – from toys and decorated trees, to entertainment and joy. modeled after the traditional wooden pyramid, each of the three levels were hand-carved and hand-painted by the macy’s parade studio to encapsulate different aspects of the holiday season enjoyed around the world. “knowing who balsam hill was, for us, we immediately zeroed in on authenticity. we wanted things to have that kind of detail and overall beauty,” said john piper, vice-president of macy’s parade studio. he added, “this one was just a real work of joy and love for us.” at the base of the float, multiple balsam hill trees are adorned with stunning decorations in different styles to showcase a host of family traditions. whimsical, larger-than-life ornaments, toys, and a snowman help capture the magic and joy of christmas. the centerpiece of the float is a stunning carousel that spins as it is ridden by children dressed in snowy winter wonderland inspired costumes. to complete the scene, each year a special performer will delight audiences as the float makes its way down the parade route and into millions of homes this thanksgiving. show less » #1 choice for top set designers
