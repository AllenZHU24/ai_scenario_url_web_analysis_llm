(if you are looking for a space saving tree, we recommend our fifth avenue flatback tree, which is designed to look like a full tree while only taking up half the space.) for expert advice call 1.888.55.balsam or email us » receive exclusive offers view newsletter sample » stay connected shop trees corporate sales christmas tree buyer's guide branch sample kit wreaths & garlands christmas decorations clearance sale visit us balsam hill tv ad about balsam hill® about us the balsam hill difference ® media inquiries in the news corporate philanthropy recall balsam hill blog balsam hill united kingdom balsam hill france balsam hill germany balsam hill australia customer service contact us faq warranty information return info order tracking shipping information international shipping information terms & privacy policy site map assembly guides assembling your tree assembling your tree lights shaping your tree storing your tree troubleshooting setup videos top searches artificial christmas trees • prelit artificial christmas trees • christmas wreaths • white christmas trees balsam hill canada • garlands • artificial christmas tree sale • balsam hill video channel • balsam hill light assembly guides shop with confidence * shipping outside the continental us and over-sized items requiring truck shipping will incur additional shipping fees. copyright © 2013 balsam hill ® all rights reserved.
