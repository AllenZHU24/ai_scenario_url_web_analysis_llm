artificial christmas trees come in various sizes and shapes. to narrow down your options, choose a spot to determine if you have space for a small christmas tree or a tall one. christmas tree height guide a good rule of thumb is to have at least 6 inches between the top of your tree and the ceiling. this also accounts for a topper or any decorative stand that adds height to the tree. so, if you have the standard 9-foot ceiling and a 12-inch angel topper, you’d want a 7.5-foot christmas tree. we measure our trees from the stand to the topmost tip. under 6 feet miniature trees for tabletops, bedrooms, kid’s rooms, and small spaces 6 to 6½ feet designed for areas with low ceilings 7 to 7½ feet the best size for standard 8- to 9-foot ceilings 8 to 9 feet ideal for rooms with high ceilings 10 to 14 feet perfect for public spaces and vaulted ceilings 15 feet and above tall christmas trees for grand displays artificial tree shapes a tree’s shape gives you a general idea how much room it takes up. go for a wide, full tree if you have a spacious area and a narrow or slim one for limited spaces. calculate your available floor space and check it against the dimensions on our site. we base these measurements on the widest point of the tree. full the most popular shape, with the classic profile of natural christmas trees shop full trees » slim our most compact trees, designed for tight spaces and corners shop slim trees » flatback space savers with a full profile but rest flat against a wall or corner shop flatback trees » sparse lifelike trees with spaces between branches to showcase ornaments shop sparse trees » learn more about christmas tree sizing » how realistic will an artificial christmas tree look? going artificial doesn’t mean saying goodbye to the look and feel of your favorite tree. we design many of our balsam hill® christmas trees after real species—from the shape and texture of the needles to the nuances in color. best of all, they stay evergreen and need little to no maintenance. needle type we categorize needle types according to the material used. pvc needles are flat and papery while polyethylene (pe) needles have more dimension. some trees feature a combination of both—the more realistic the tree, the higher the pe count. read the foliage details, look at close-up photos, or check our branch sample kit to find out more. true needle® created by balsam hill, these injection-molded pe needles mimic the structure, texture, and color variations of natural evergreens shop true needle trees » classic needle soft, flat, and flexible pvc needles with a more classic artificial christmas tree look shop classic needle trees » levels of realism realism relates to the types of needles used in a tree. at balsam hill, we categorize our trees into three levels. most realistic has more than 65% true needle (pe) foliage for outstanding realism, with classic needles (pvc) near the trunk for added fullness shop most realistic trees » realistic up to 65% true needle (pe) foliage mixed with classic needle (pvc) for a great balance between realism and budget shop realistic trees » traditional our most cost-effective trees with 100% classic needle (pvc) foliage shop traditional trees » species certain species may hold special meaning because they remind you of the christmas tree you had growing up. that’s why we use nature as inspiration and create molds from real branch clippings to make highly realistic artificial christmas trees. fir dense branches with flat and flexible needles sprouting individually from the stem featured: bh balsam fir® » spruce rough branches with needles growing singly from the stem. unlike firs, spruce needles have four sides and sharp points featured: vermont white spruce® » pine sparser branches around the trunk, with thin needles attached to the stem in clusters of two, three, or five featured: rocky mountain pine » color depending on the species, real trees come in different shades of green and the same is true for balsam hill trees. for instance, the blue spruce has blue-green needles while the noble fir has a gray tint to it. some trees are also multi-toned like the fraser fir with its dark green tips and silver undersides. green well-loved green trees in various hues depending on the species featured: yukon spruce® » white white branches to make your ornaments pop featured: denali white® christmas tree » frosted lightly flocked trees with a dusting of faux snow featured: frosted alpine balsam fir® » learn more about christmas tree realism » insider’s tip still can’t decide which tree to buy?

aside from the technical factors above, here are other things to look into when choosing your artificial christmas tree: price range artificial christmas trees often cost more than real trees because they last season after season. find one that suits your budget, from slim space-savers to tall, highly realistic trees. prices vary based on tree size, needle composition, light types, and set-up features. key decorations all balsam hill trees are made with sturdy, flexible branches to support ornaments of various size and weight. you can layer assorted decorations, use ribbons, and fill gaps with picks. visit our blog for inspiration. christmas tree toppers if using a tree topper, make sure there’s at least 6 inches of clearance from the top of the tree topper and your ceiling. our trees have a strong top branch tip to secure your topper. for heavier toppers, use a tree topper stabilization kit. christmas tree skirts, collars, & stands choose a tree skirt that’s at least 6 inches bigger than the full width of the tree. it should completely cover the stand and be larger than the entire diameter of the base of your tree. if you want an alternative, tree collars and stands are ideal. collars latch around the base, while decorative stands replace the base and support the weight of your tree. compatibility depends on the tree height and pole diameter, so double check the specifications to make sure it fits. learn more about christmas tree decorations » care & storage store your tree in a cool, dry place to keep it in good condition. storage bags are recommended to keep dust and the elements from harming your tree. all balsam hill trees come with a light-weight bag/s for easy storage year after year. for more tips, read our storage guide. best time to buy an artificial christmas tree artificial trees are sold all year long, but you’ll find the best deals during major shopping days such as black friday and cyber monday. you can also take advantage of post-christmas clearance sales and christmas in july. insider’s tip for updates on promos and exclusive discounts, subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on social media. why choose balsam hill artificial christmas trees?
