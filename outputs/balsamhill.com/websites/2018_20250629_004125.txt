"this is only our first year with these trees, but so far, we are impressed." - paul s "my rocky mountain pine tree arrived quickly and was packaged well. the tree is beautiful and full, and was very easy to assemble. we appreciated the gloves that were enclosed - it made it a lot easier to shape the branches. it's really a beautiful tree, and we are very pleased with our purchase and the service received from balsam hill." - debra crowder "i purchased the tabletop tree for our local boys and girls club festival of trees, to be auctioned off. the day before the event as i was setting up my tree, the other designers repeatedly asked me if it was a real tree! they all had to feel for themselves! my theme was "crystal fantasy" so the tree was decorated completely in clear crystal, glass or plastic ornaments - all heavy - but the tree was sturdy enough not to wilt under the weight. i was very satisfied with the final bid on the tree. the tree arrived in excellent condition; very well packed, easy to set up and i appreciated all the extra supplies which accompanied the tree." "overall, a very satisfactory purchase which will be repeated next year." - sylvia domotor "i ordered the 6.5 blue spruce tree with clear lights and the vermont white spruce with clear lights for my outdoor wreath. they arrived within a few short days and were carefully packaged. the tree took just a few minutes to assemble. we spent about 30 minutes fluffing the branches. the tree is beautifully shaped and lit. we put it up thanksgiving weekend and decorated it. we have lighted it every day since then and are thoroughly enjoying the tree. the biggest compliment we receive from our guests is that they think it is real. i appreciate the storage bag provided and the gloves for use during assembly. the wreath is lovely and decorates our front door. i have enjoyed my shopping experience and believe my purchase is a very good value." - susan clark "first i bought the tree and i must admit it is heavy but it is full and beautiful. i love the choice i have of all white lights, all colored lights or both! usually i do both and you really don't even need ornaments but of course i do and this year i bought ornaments from balsam hill and they came and look as if they are worth way more than i paid, thank you for putting together such a beautiful group." - cathrine craig "the tree took quite a bit of time to fluff (my husband worked on it for several hours over 5 days) as there are so many branches, especially since we bought the 9' tree. he's very proud of his painstaking effort though because the tree looks beautiful! on a side note, we were both very impressed that the tree came with gloves. they were quite useful." - pamela "the website had very detailed explanations of the needle types along with great pictures. we were very impressed with the packaging and presentation in the boxes. detailed instructions, laminated reference card, gloves for spreading the branches just put it over the top. the tree itself is a beautiful assortment of needle types, we couldn't be happier! and the price was very comperable to other vendors whose trees were not as life like!" - art lejeune "this was my first purchase from balsam and my expectations were exceeded. beautiful ornaments, even better than the pictures show. the packaging was better than any packaging i have ever had. ornaments were well protected. i can't wait to order more products! big fan!" - jenny "i am very picky with my trees and i shopped for months for the right tree. i love the negative space of this tree, it allows for drop ornaments to hang freely, as well as space to push the larger ornaments inside to add dimension to the tree. it is a beautiful tree and well lit. i highly recommend this tree." - jared "i adore this tree and so do our friends and family. it is always the most talked about thing/décor during our gatherings. it has a beautiful full appearance with a great amount of lights giving it a gorgeous holiday glow in your home. it was hard to assemble but now with the easy-plug it is much better! we love the remote control and the options for clear lights, color lights, or both." - brittney « back to main page get inspired discover the latest holiday products and decorating styles receive our best promotions and offers be the first to know about our giveaways sign up thank youfor signing up to receive emailsfrom balsam hill. for expert advice call 1.888.55.balsamor email us » stay connected balsam hill on facebookbalsam hill on twitterbalsam hill on google plusbalsam hill on youtubebalsam hill on pinterestbalsam hill blog customer support faqcontact uscheck order statusshippingreturns & exchangeswarrantyrequest a catalogcatalog unsubscribeemail preferencescorporate salesdesign trade programsubmit a review resources & ideas resource centertree buyer's guidebranch sample kittree setup & storagetree decorating ideasdesigns seen on tvblogvideos company information about usthe balsam hill differencestore locationsin the mediacharitable givingcareersterms & privacy change country ▾ australia france germany united kingdom shop with confidence * shipping outside the contiguous us will incur additional shipping fees. copyright © 2018 balsam hill ® all rights reserved. please enter a valid email address loading... currencycountryselector.heading currencycountryselector.country.label {{country.name}} currencycountryselector.currency.label {{currency.isocode}} ({{currency.symbol}}) currencycountryselector.continue.label we're sorry. your form has expired due to 30 minutes of inactivity. continue we're sorry. retry
