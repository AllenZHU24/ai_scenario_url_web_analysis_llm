(if you are looking for a space saving tree, we recommend our fifth avenue flatback tree, which is designed to look like a full tree while only taking up half the space.) company information shop need assistance? the balsam hill ® difference contact us media inquiries in the news christmas tree buyer's guide balsam hill videos balsam hill blog corporate philanthropy wreaths & garlands ornaments & skirts sale items branch sample kit customer service: 1.888.55.balsam faq return info site map stay connected: sign up to receive exclusive email updates artificial christmas trees | prelit artificial christmas trees | christmas wreaths | white christmas trees balsam hill canada | garlands | artificial christmas tree sale | balsam hill video channel | balsam hill light assembly guides copyright © 2010 balsam hill ® all rights reserved.
