are our passion. we offer the widest selection of luxurious, realistic looking trees on the market. most christmas tree brands, including some that say “exclusive,” purchase their trees from brokers who order trees from various factories and suppliers. in contrast, balsam hill™ designs and produces each one of our trees ourselves — one of the only brands of christmas trees that can truly say this. when you buy from balsam hill, you can be assured that your tree has been hand-crafted with care to ensure quality and longevity. our artisan-designed trees have a multitude of branches, branch tips, and lights that create a rich, full look for your christmas tree. stunningly realistic branch tips from the asymmetrical branch design right down to the subtle color changes and texture of our branch tips, you won't believe how much our trees mimic the real thing. using nature as their guide, our designers model the silhouette and branch tips of our signature collections trees off of natural evergreen species. with our exclusive true needle™ technology, the trees in our four signature collections have foliage that is carefully crafted to match the subtle color variations and feel of your favorite natural trees. hand–strung, long–lasting lights if you long for the beautiful glow of lights on your tree but dread untangling the wires, balsam hill's pre-lit trees are the answer. all of our lights are professionally strung on the tree by hand to minimize the appearance of wires. each of our trees comes with premium commercial grade lights so that if one bulb burns out or is removed, the rest stay lit. we have a wide variety of lighting options to suit every decorating need. you can select from foot-pedal controlled warm clear lights or festive multicolored lights, or choose our color+clear™ remote-controlled lighting system to change the light color to suit your holiday mood. if you prefer led lights, you will love our premium energy-saving led-lit trees with lights that never burn out. we offer trees with candlelight™ led lights, the first led christmas lights with a warm holiday glow, and options with clear led lights. widest selection of shapes & sizes whether you're tight for space on fifth avenue, or have soaring ceilings in aspen, there's a tree for any room in your home or apartment. with the largest selection of heights––from four to 30 feet––and widths ranging from slim to full, you can find the perfect tree to fit your space. easy setup & storage we believe the holidays should be hassle-free. included with every tree are protective gloves to help shape your tree, as well as free storage bag(s) for safe off-season storage. our easy plug™ setup option connects each section's lights within the trunk, so you only need to plug into the wall. for ultimate ease of setup, our exclusive flip trees™ rotate into display in seconds, and storeupside-down on a built-in rolling stand. the outstanding realism of balsam hill has been made even more convenient with the innovative technology of flip trees. complete the look balsam hill™ offers matching wreaths & garlands for most of our trees. professionally pre-lit with quality lights that can handle the cold, our wreaths and garlands are a perfect way to extend your holiday décor, indoors or outdoors. we also offer a wide array of stunningly realistic faux florals and high-quality fall and christmas decorations for decorating your home year-round. shop now » our exclusive branch sample for those of you who would like the opportunity to view samples of our products in person before you purchase your new tree, we are pleased to offer our exclusive branch sample kit. no other artificial christmas tree seller offers anything like this. our kit allows you to view the color and feel the texture of the needles used in our trees, including our exclusive true needle™ technology, right from your home. our branch sample kit comes complete with samples from each of our full sized trees. we always send a complete sample branch, rather than a single branch tip, so that you can review each of the needle types used in our trees. these sample branches are made from the exact same needles as our trees, so you will know exactly what to expect before placing your order. preview now » convenience, delivered right to your door because our trees have so many branches, they tend to be heavier than other similarly sized trees. rather than packing the entire tree in one giant package, we ship our large trees in several manageable boxes, which are delivered right to your door. all of our trees come with a lightweight premium steel stand with rubber feet, and one or more convenient storage bags to safely store your tree. we even include gloves to protect your hands from prickly branches during assembly.
