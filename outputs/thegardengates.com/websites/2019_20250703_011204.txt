he could make money the old-fashioned way, mowing neighborhood lawns.  during these early years, he became inspired by flowering gardens and the changes they encountered.  years later, his love-- or fascination--with gardening became alive.  he found himself dreaming of a place for everyone to enjoy.  this became reality when the garden gate open a retail store in metairie, la. the garden gate retail store opened in 1990 with co-founders chad everett harris and jacqueline elizabeth 'beth' kendall-harris. the husband-and-wife team sought to start a retail operation that complemented both chad's gardening and landscape design acumen and beth's eye for style and design. beth played an instrumental role in product development, interior design and the fine-tuning the core principles of the garden gates lifestyle, while chad was the brains behind the creativity of the brand, marketing, and technology of the business. over the years, the garden gate was a destination in the old metairie neighborhood located in southern louisiana.  during 2015, the harris' met an impasse with their landlord and were unable to negotiate the continued property lease.  this resulted in the retail store closing and it was heartbreaking for everyone, our family, our staff, and our community. today in the summer of 2015, after their parents closed the retail store, aiden and ashton harris, took their parents' entrepreneurship lead and launched a brand new fully functional online destination featuring the best in home & garden decor. thegardengates.com has a team of landscape architects, designers, and lifestyle enthusiast that assist customers nationwide. the history of the garden gates is being written as we speak;
