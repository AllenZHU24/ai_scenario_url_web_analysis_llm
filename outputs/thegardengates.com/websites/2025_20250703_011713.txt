richmond hill fountain by campania international the richmond hill fountain cools the surrounding area, making it a welcome addition to outdoor spaces during hot weather. they can also improve air quality by releasing small amounts of moisture into the air, which can be especially beneficial in dry climates. the sound of flowing water can also be calming, making fountains popular for relaxation areas. they can attract wildlife, such as birds and butterflies, enhancing the natural beauty of the surroundings. skilled artisans in the usa handcraft the richmond hill fountain. with their extensive experience, the campania team applies the unique patina, ensuring each piece is extraordinary. this fountain is shown in the alpine stone color. campania international's proprietary cast stone blend is meticulously molded to create each piece used in the construction of this fountain. due to the use of different materials and manufacturing processes, as well as varying photography conditions, natural variations in size, weight, and color can occur. the actual color may differ from the photo. in winter, it's best to remove fountain tops to prevent cracking and raise bases off the ground to avoid freezing.  when leaving it outside, remove pumps and small components, cover the top with burlap, wrap it with dark plastic, and regularly check to ensure no water accumulates. before the first freeze, drain, dry, and cover the fountain. specifications dimensions: color shown: alpine stoneoverall: 46.5 inches long x 46.5 inches wide x 66 inches tallweight: 869 lbs
