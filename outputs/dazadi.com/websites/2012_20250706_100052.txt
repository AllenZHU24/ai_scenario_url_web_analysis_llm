as you begin your search for a basketball system, it is vital to determine the age range, skill level and type of player you've got at home. a casual basketball player does not need the same quality basketball goal as someone who is aspiring to play organized basketball. a family with small children, for instance, requires an adjustable basketball hoop so that the rim height can be raised or lowered at your convenience. in this way, your hoop grows with your children! a backboard measuring 48 – 54 inches, made from shatterproof polycarbonate, acrylic or even eco-friendly recycled materials provides plenty of durability and rebound space at a budget-friendly price. dazadi.com carries plenty of systems and wall mount hoops at different sizes and price points to fit your family's needs. a serious adult basketball player, on the other hand, will want to purchase systems with larger, higher quality basketball backboards and rims, thicker poles and regulation specifications so that their home system feels the same as the one they play on competitively. should i buy an in-ground, portable, or a wall mounted hoop? if you have permanent location for your basketball court, buy an in-ground basketball hoop. in-ground systems are always preferred over portables and wall mounts as their cement installation allows them to be the most rigid, durable, and sturdy. if you need to be able to move your system, or don't want to deal with cement installation, buy a portable basketball hoop. they are convenient and allow you to play basketball just about anywhere. also, some homeowners associations have rules about what can be left outside all day or permanently installed in front of your home. a portable hoop will allow you to shoot hoops in the driveway and roll it into storage when not in use. if you are not able to provide any ground space for a basketball system or simply don't want to have a pole in the way, you should consider a backboard and rim combo or wall mounted basketball system. these kinds of systems allow you to mount a basketball hoop directly to a wall, roof, or garage. if you still have questions, read through our complete basketball hoop buying guide to help you narrow your selection further. in addition to our premium selection of basketball hoops for sale, we also offer an extensive selection of basketball accessories including basketball court marking stencil kits, hoop lights, rolbak nets, spalding and molten basketballs, basketball training aids, basketball nets, coaches equipment, and much more. sports and fitness archery badminton baseball basketball residential basketball hoops basketballs basketball accessories basketball training aids coaches equipment scoreboards boxing cycling exercise and fitness fan shop football golf lacrosse p.e. equipment paddleball racquetball soccer softball sports field equipment sports medicine street hockey tennis volleyball sign up for special offers your email address will never be sold to a third party. read our privacy policy the dazadi difference awesome hand-picked products easy 365 day returns free shipping on every item in-home delivery 24/7 customer service safe & secure shopping dazadi-pedia buying guides blog help quick links shipping information faqs return policy track your order contact customer support security and privacy about dazadi the company the history of dazadi what is the dazadi difference?
