all items are shipped with 100% insurance coverage as long as the delivery acceptance guidelines listed below are followed: when your order is delivered, immediately inspect the outer carton (on every side, including the bottom) and entire contents for any potential damage that may have occurred during shipping. for all freight shipments, it is important to document any damage or shortages on the delivery receipt. be as specific as possible when noting punctures, scratches or shortages. notations such as "hole in box," "packaging torn" and "missing carton" are necessary to establish carrier responsibility. it is normal for the carton to show some wear; however, if it is clear that major damage has occurred, refuse the delivery and contact us immediately for a replacement. if any minor damage has occurred that you believe can be replaced with parts, note the damage on the delivery receipt and accept the item. contact us for replacement parts. small package deliveries, such as those by ups or fedex, should be carefully inspected as well. notify the driver of any potential damage before accepting delivery. if the package was left without collecting a signature, inspect the package and its contents as soon as possible and contact us with any discrepancies. if the driver refuses to allow you to sign the delivery receipt in the manner previously described above, refuse delivery and contact us immediately. damage and shortages must be reported within 10 days of receiving your order. failure to follow these steps absolves dazadi.com and the carrier of shipment responsibility. top of page shipping issues what if there is a problem with my order? in the unlikely event that your order is incorrect, missing parts, damaged or defective, please contact us within 10 days of receiving the item and we will send you the correct product, replacement product, or replacement parts at no cost to you. what should i do if my shipment is lost? hang tight. usually "lost" shipments have just been misrouted. contact us if your shipment is missing cartons or the carrier has alerted you about potential missing freight. dazadi.com will immediately initiate a tracer on the shipment, as required by the shipping companies. if, after 3 business days, the shipment or missing cartons cannot be located, we will ship another to you at no additional charge. what should i do if my shipment is stolen? in order to get your item to you as quickly as possible, we do not require a signature upon delivery, with the exception of freight shipments. you are responsible for providing a secure delivery address. any item that is lost or stolen, but shows confirmed delivery, is not the responsibility of dazadi.com. if you are concerned about the delivery address, please consider shipping to work or an alternate address instead. how do i return an order?
