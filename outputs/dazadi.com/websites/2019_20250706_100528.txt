fueled by a bold vision and a bit of gumption, they form dazadi (pronounced dazz-uh-dee) – a name that combines audacity and tzadik, the hebrew word for a person who always does the right thing. today, dazadi is run by the same family that still shares so much life and laughter. only now, the love and laughter echo across the country, in the homes of countless friends and families who enjoy the amazing selection of products that dazadi delivers. games that bring people closer. fitness equipment that helps them get healthier. entertainment equipment that encourages the “victory dance” . thousands of amazing products that are affordable and accessible (free shipping included!). all with one simple goal – the simple joy of time spent with the ones we love. when worries are forgotten. treasured memories are made. and there’s not a video screen in sight. to us, that’s awesome. that’s dazadi. core values be awesome – be exceptional in all we do. whether it’s the products we offer, the service we provide or the value we deliver, customers can always expect a completely positive, hassle-free experience. be different – when it comes to quality leisure time, our customers have a lot of options. we continually strive to offer new and better ways for them to enjoy their free time with friends and family. be positive – we’re in the business of fun, family, friends and making memories. we feel pretty darn good about that and it shows in how we treat our people and our customers. be accountable – we do what we say we’re going to do. period. be respectful – in today’s hectic world, free time is a precious commodity. we never take for granted that our customers entrust us to help them make the most of it. we’re driven to exceed their expectations. make things right – if there’s a problem, whatever the reason, we make it right for the customer, if at all possible. what is the dazadi difference?
