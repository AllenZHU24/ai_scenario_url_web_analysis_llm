dazadi.com history the dazadi story begins in the san fernando valley of los angeles: the founding brothers, ari, jason, elan, and josh developed a love of sports and games while playing as kids in the valley. every free moment was spent playing endless hours of basketball, chess, backgammon, pool, and various other games. in fact, it often seemed that life revolved around the very games they played. the skills developed by the boys went far beyond simple rules and tactics of a given game. playing those games helped them bond as brothers. one afternoon while playing basketball, the young mens' basketball hoop broke. this major setback prompted an immediate trip to the nearest chain sporting goods store for a replacement. the brothers were terribly disappointed. the store lacked selection and customer service. not only was the hoop overpriced, but they had to pay for delivery charges because it wouldn't fit in their car. after returning, ari decided that they should start their own basketball store. it would offer a huge selection, tons of information, great customer service, and best of all, free shipping. ari named the site: superduperhoops.com. jason, elan, and josh loved the idea and immediately began working together with ari to build super duper. within two years they had developed three sites; superduperhoops.com, superdupergames.com, and superduperbaseball.com. the super duper sites are still on the web, and continue to draw a loyal following, but in 2006 the brothers felt the need to create one site where all of the products could be offered. they realized that through one coherent, well organized site they could offer a better service to the customer. it was through those discussions that dazadi.com was born. the brothers derived the name dazadi (pronounced dazz-uh-dee) by morphing the words audacity (meaning bold or daring) and tzadik (the hebrew word for righteous person). in their minds it was the perfect description for the type of business they were about to develop. just as they had experienced as kids, the "dazadi brothers" now wanted to share their love of game and sport with the world, and to offer a shopping experience that was as enjoyable as the products themselves. from a young age, each brother was taught the value of hard work, integrity, and the joy of life. they also learned the importance of giving back to the community. over the years, dazadi has donated products and funds to youth sports teams, military troops serving overseas, boys and girls clubs, schools, and many other organizations. in addition, they developed dazadi community (www.dazadi.com/community.php) which helps groups raise money for their organizations by donating 5% of every sale they drive to the dazadi.com website. it is their way of practicing the values upon which dazadi.com was founded. why shop dazadi? exceptional customer service product experts extensive selection 30 day satisfaction guarantee safe and secure shopping exceptional customer service we understand the vital importance of being easily available for our customers, and we've made it our mission to answer every question and address every issue. when you call our customer service line during normal business hours, you will talk to a real live person who really wants to help you. if you prefer to email us, we make sure you receive a response within one business day. product experts our call center is staffed with product experts who can help you sort through our extensive selection and pick the perfect product. when you call our customer service number from 8 am to 5 pm pacific time, you can get in contact with a product expert who has seen, touched, researched, and approved of every product on our site. so give them a call and pick their brains. extensive selection we know that dazadi customers come from very diverse tastes, backgrounds, locations, and budgets and we work hard to load our site with enough options to keep everybody satisfied. in fact, we are constantly seeking out the latest and greatest quality products and updating our selection on a daily basis. if you are interested in a particular product that you can't find on dazadi.com, please give us a call and we will do everything we can to locate it for you.
