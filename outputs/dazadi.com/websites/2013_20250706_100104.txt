read on for what we thinks makes an awesome party! 1. lawn games lawn games provide fun entertainment for family and friends of all skill levels. popular games include bocce ball, ladder ball and croquet. 2.scooters need adult time? put the kids on scooters for hours of fun! check out our bike shop for a wide variety of scooters. 3. table tennis nothing creates more competition than game tables. our most popular outdoor game table is our harvil table tennis table! 4. folding chairs & tables um … this is a no brainier! people need to sit. folding chairs and tables are great for those hosting a remote party  or  for those who do not have the storage year round to keep outdoor furniture displayed. with folding chairs and tables you can also add/remove the amount of seating you need to pair with existing seating! 5. home concessions have everyone talk about your party for weeks afterwards by seeding the party with something unique. we love popcorn makers, hotdog stands, cotton candy machines and snow-cones machines!
