portable vs standby home backup generators portable standby which one is best for you? how to power your home year-round? in an everchanging environment there are many warnings and alerts whether it be severe weather, wildfires, floods or even the outdated power grid serving our communities. many homeowners and families now have to ask themselves the question of “what are my options if my electricity went out for an extended period of time?” protecting your homestead and family are the two most important things to consider and that includes not only the physical presences but also the food in the refrigerator, keeping the well pump running for water, cell phones/tablets charged for communication, heaters and/or air conditioners.these all are considered vital resources you will need available during a prolonged outage whether it is summer or winter. luckily there are many options available and we will dive into each option to shed some light on what the best options are in the market while defining what makes each one unique. portable home backup traditional standby home backup portable option 1 a portable generator is any unit that is not permanently affixed to the property and can either be wheeled or carried around the home. this option tends to be more popular because not only is it cost conscious, it also offers the most flexibility if power outages are not that common. it can be used with a power extension cord and any surge protector available at any hardware or outdoors store. this main benefit is for when power only a few appliances such as a fridge, lights and phone chargers. another advantage is this unit can be taken almost anywhere such as campgrounds, tailgates and more. generator$1,000 power cord$40 power strip$25 total $1,065 portable option 2 this option is where we begin to blend the features of a portable generator with the benefits of a hard-wired traditional standby generator. while using a portable generator with one main power cord, we can utilize what is called a gen interlock kit that is able to harness the generators full power into a power inlet box that connects to your existing breaker box. this will allow you to strategically power key circuits or rooms in your home without running extension cords. the power will flow from the generator through the power cord into the existing power panel on the side of your home. generator$1,000 power cord$40 inlet box$75 interlock kit$60 total $1,175 *cost of professional installation not calculated. please contact your local electrician for a quote. portable option 3 similar to a standby generator installation, this option allows you to separate the key circuits in your home and have them wired to a transfer switch which allows full control of where and what you are powering during an outage. these transfer switches also act as an additional buffer between the generator and your power panel in the event of any mishaps. it affords the convenience of a hard-wired, permanent standby option in a portable solution. generator$1,000 power cord$40 inlet box$75 transfer switch$400 total $1,515 *cost of professional installation not calculated. please contact your local electrician for a quote. traditional home standby a traditional standby generator is a permanent pad-mounted that turn on when your local utility power supply is down and can supply the home with power. these larger units tend to be operated on either natural gas or propane. they are considered a substantial investment which also translates to more research and having to consult with multiple electricians to ensure you are getting a unit that will fit not only your budget but also be in compliance with any local or municipal codes. for standard installation it will require an electrician and a plumber to get the unit set-up, connected to a fuel source and wired in to your home. generator$5,000 generator pad$425 power cord$40 inlet box$75 transfer switch$400 total $5,940 *cost of professional installation not calculated. please contact your local electrician for a quote. what does it cost to install a traditional standby generator? starting the search for a standby generator first requires contacting and setting up a consultation with a certified and licensed electrician and plumber. we recommend reaching out to 2-3 to ensure the information communicated with is accurate and up to code with any regulations in your area. some cities require a permit for the electrical work in addition to the underground plumbing required to provide fuel to the standby generator. standby generators also must be mounted on a flat, level pad of either cement or cement fiber hybrid. this sometimes requires not only having your yard dug for the generator but also the plumbing for the fuel source. next begins the process of determining your power consumption and locating the properly sized unit for your residence. standby generators are sometimes built to order which can result in an extended lead time of 60-90 days to have your unit delivered. on average, the cost of a standby generator can range from $3,500 with installation at a single family home adding up to an additional $5,000. it is almost certain that budgeting for most fully packaged and installed units is around $8,000 minimum. what are the benefits of going with a portable home backup solution? utilizing a portable home backup solution such as those offered by duromax are advantageous because of the affordability and flexibility they provide. they allow renters and homeowners the capability of power during any unplanned outages. portability is what sets these two options apart due to the fact that whether its needing power at the jobsite, little league field or even if your plans change and you need to move cross-country you can simply wheel the unit into a truck and have power at your next location up on your arrival. the cost to acquire a portable home backup solution is ideal and can start at $500 for a generator to power just the essentials with some of the full-home power options in the mid $1000 range. cost of installation is also much lower and only becomes a factor once a power inlet box and/or transfer switch is installed. no unsightly large standby generator box on any side of your home as well as no trenching or deconstruction of your yard for plumbing. portable home backup generators are the future of keeping everyone powered anywhere. portable & standby generators power cords transfer switches & inlet boxes generator interlock kits
