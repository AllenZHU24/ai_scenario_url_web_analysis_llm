charge. occasionally, pre-authorizations show up on online banking as if they are real charges until they fall off, generally within 24 - 48 hours after the order is placed. we only charge or collect money when your order actually ships. please note: on orders that have a longer lead time, a reauthorization will be placed every 30 days on the credit card to ensure it is still a valid payment method. you may be contacted to update your credit card information if the authorization is unable to go through. why was my credit card charged multiple times?when a customer places an order, there is a pre-authorization on their credit card for the full purchase amount. that is an authorization only, not an actual charge. occasionally pre-authorizations show up on online banking as if they are real charges until they fall off. they generally fall off 24 - 48 hours after the order is placed. we only charge or collect money when your order actually ships. if you ordered more than one item, you may see multiple charges appear on your credit card statement, but the total collected will never be more than the total of your entire purchase price. please note: on orders that have a longer lead time, a reauthorization will be placed every 30 days on the credit card to ensure it is still a valid payment method. you may be contacted to update your credit card information if the authorization is unable to go through.what is your tax id number?we do not ship outside the united states as we are not a registered exporter, but we can ship to a freight forwarder with a u.s. address. as a retailer, our sale to you is completed upon fulfillment to the ship-to address supplied on your order. please note, our business name or tax id cannot be used on your export paperwork. you would be responsible for providing tax information on export paperwork. the form that you need to fill out is the shipperâs export declaration (sed) for items valued over $2,500. this form simply asks for the exporterâs name and tax id in boxes 1a and 1b. since you are the exporter on record, your ss# or tax id should be used.if you are exporting the order from a state where we are required to collect sales tax, such as florida, and you can provide us with written documentation that the order is leaving the country, including the freight forwarder information, your purchase would be tax exempt. the address on your documentation must match either your billing or your shipping address used for your order.shipping & deliveryhow will my order be delivered?we offer several different shipping options to deliver your order in the most expedient manner. most shipments over 150 pounds are made using freight carriers and loaded on semi trailers. if you do not have access to a forklift and dock, we encourage you to select our lift gate service that will safely lower your product to the curb from a smaller truck.smaller shipments under 150 pounds may ship using ground shipping and may be eligible for 2nd-day and next-day air.once your order is finalized, it will be processed and then shipped. once shipped, you will automatically receive an email confirmation with the tracking information. read more about shipping. can i pick up my order at the freight terminal?you must call our customer support team to make arrangements with the freight carrier to arrange a pickup. products are not stocked at shipping terminals. if authorized, you will need to bring a photo id that matches the name on the order to receive your shipment. your order will not be released if it doesnât match.can i request a small truck for delivery?your order will ship on a full-sized semi-truck and will deliver curb side, which means that the driver will not pull into a residential driveway due to liability issues. unfortunately, not all of the trucking terminals have access to smaller vehicles for residential deliveries. we will need to contact the carrier to see if they offer white glove service and provide you a quote as this is would be added fee.will the freight carrier deliver to my garage or door?please be aware that your order ships on a full-sized semi-truck. the delivery method is considered curbside delivery, which means that the driver will not pull into a residential driveway due to liability issues. if you order lift gate service, the driver will unload the shipment from the truck but is not required to move your shipment from the drop point at the base of your driveway. some drivers are very courteous and will do so but are not required to do so. you will receive a call from the carrier to schedule a delivery appointment after your order ships. if you have any special circumstances you can mention them at that time however, we cannot promise that your requests can be granted.will the freight carrier deliver without a signature?depending on the carrier, you may be required to accept and sign for the delivery. if you accept delivery without a signature, you are responsible for inspecting and notifying us of any damages within 2 days of delivery. once the order ships, you do have the ability to contact the carrier to coordinate a window of time that will allow you to be present for delivery.what if my order arrives damaged?if receiving a scheduled freight delivery, you must inspect the goods before you sign the delivery receipt from the carrier. if you see or suspect any damage, notate "damaged" on the delivery receipt while the driver is present. if receiving a âno-signature required delivery,â it is critical to check for both visible and concealed damage before attempting to use any product. you should also look to make sure that no parts are missing or broken. if you discover any issue, you must contact us within two days of the delivery.do you offer expedited shipping?yes, during times of normal operation, we may offer the option for expedited shipping on certain products. the options for shipping will be visible on the product pages on our website and will depend on the product, your zip code, and the method of transport the product requires for delivery.paying for expedited shipping means we will prioritize processing your product so it can be shipped from our warehouse first. however, be aware that once the product leaves our facility and experiences delays due to circumstances (like fedex temporarily suspending service while your product is en-route), we are not liable for those delays.during times of crisis or natural disaster (like hurricanes or covid-19), we will continue to operate and ship products in accordance with our safety guidelines and the guidelines set forth by our distribution networks. when processing times are extended, we may suspend expedited shipping on products. do you ship outside the united states?due to regulatory requirements, we cannot ship directly to locations outside the united states, including canada and u.s. territories. for customers residing in the
