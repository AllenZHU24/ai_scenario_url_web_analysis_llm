covered by the manufacturer's warranty. if your aluminum bat is defective, the manufacturer requires that it be returned directly to them. please call the manufacturer toll free for current details. for non-defective aluminum bats, simply return it to us within 30 days, unused and in the original "shrink-wrapped" or "sleeve" packaging. once this packaging is removed we are no longer able to
