cheap razor blades already a member? loginor, join the club like most good ideas, the dollar shave club started with two guys who were pissed off about something and decided to do something about it… we got tired of spending $15-$20 every time we bought razor blades. we asked ourselves, did we really need all this fancy technology in our shave: a vibrating handle, led guide-lights, 8-blades, and grip that could steady a 9-iron? the answer was a defiant “no”! we felt like we’d been over-marketed to. “big shave” companies keep telling us we need more expensive equipment, but why? shaving should be simple. it sure used to be. look at old photos of your father & grandfather. they didn’t have extreme shave gear, and they look pretty handsome, don’t they? so… we teamed up with one of the world’s leading blade manufacturers and created the ninja blade. it’s got everything you need in a shave: two stainless steel blades, aloe vera lubrication bar, and a pivot head. and guess what. it’s more affordable than any other blade available. but we didn’t stop there… we thought: you know what also sucks… forgetting to pick up razor blades at the store and then making excuses about why we look like we slept in a motel last night. razor blades are one of the most regular purchases we make. someone should just send us our blades once a month… and just like that, the dollar shave club was born! for as little as $1/month, we’ll send a cassette of five ninja blades right to your door. no more superfluous shave tech. no more stubble in the status meeting. just a great shave for a low-commitment. welcome to the club! learn how it works » who we are n' stuff what is dollar shave club how does it work about our blades social stuff facebook twitter serious stuff safe shopping guarantee privacy policy terms & conditions helpful stuff faq customer care
