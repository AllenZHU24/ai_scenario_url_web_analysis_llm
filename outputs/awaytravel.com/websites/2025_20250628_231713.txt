headed. for an overnight stay, the everywhere bag and the overnight bag give you room for one to two outfits, your favorite toiletry bag, and essentials like your phone, keys, and chargers. you can also pack your laptop or tablet in the back zipped pocket. for a weekend getaway, you can’t go wrong with the weekender travel bag. this bag unzips to a lay-flat design with mesh zip compartments for three to four outfits and other essential personal items. use the side pockets for devices, travel documents, and other must-haves. what's better than organized overnight adventures? if outdoor adventures are calling, look for midsize, lightweight duffles with water-resistant material. the active duffle 40l has enough room for three to four days away, while the active duffle 55l packs in a week’s worth of gear. slip it over your back and shoulders, and get going. if you’re headed to a business or exploring a city, smaller is better. you can navigate the city streets and see the sights with portable luggage that matches your style. from the everywhere tote to the transit canvas tote, there’s a bag perfect for your travels. plus, many feature personalization options to let you add your monogram and show off your style your way. stay in the know we’ll send you updates on our latest launches and more. need to take off? unsubscribe at any time. email address subscribe by clicking
