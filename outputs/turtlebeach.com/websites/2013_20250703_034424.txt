view legacy product database product registration register product view cart home all about xbox one the xbox one is introducing a new generation of games and entertainment and we are excited to be partnering with microsoft to introduce a new generation of turtle beach headsets designed to produce the best possible audio experience. these headsets are part of a broad partnership turtle beach has with microsoft to create innovative hardware, software, and applications that support the xbox one’s advanced audio capabilities. the new agreement, which runs through 2015, extends a relationship first revealed when turtle beach announced the xo four and xo seven next generation gaming headsets in may 2013. in connection with the launch of the xo four and xo seven headsets, turtle beach and microsoft will collaborate on consumer, trade and retailer events, as well as integrated marketing initiatives, including retail point-of-sale displays and kiosks. to connect to the xbox one, the xo series headsets require a special adaptor that is designed and manufactured by microsoft. microsoft decides how and when the adapter can be sold, and so far microsoft is only allowing two companies, including turtle beach, to include it in a bundle with a new headset. microsoft delayed manufacturing of the adapter until 2014, and as a result we had to delay the launch of the xo series headsets, which was originally scheduled to coincide with the release of the xbox one on november 22nd. we truly apologize for this delay and we remain excited to get these headsets into your hands, and to develop new audio solutions for the xbox one in 2014 and beyond. if you are in the market for a new headset this holiday, you can rest assured knowing that we'll help you transition to the xbox one once the audio adapter is ready. check out our xbox upgrade offer below to get started now. many of the headsets originally designed for the xbox 360 will actually allow you get get game audio either via optical out or the stereo output on your tv for the xbox one. visit our console compatibility app to understand how each of our current headsets will work on the xbox one. support knowledgebase alerts downloads glossary contact support international support product registration console compatibility about us company overview awards & accolades careers press releases asset portal contact us international distributors retailer locator united states europe canada australia new zealand join our mailing list language american english australian english british english french german italian japanese korean portuguese spanish © copyright 2013 turtle beach, inc. privacy statement terms of use site map thank you for signing up. use 10tbtalk for 10% off any headset order! your email address currently exists in the newsletter mailing list.
