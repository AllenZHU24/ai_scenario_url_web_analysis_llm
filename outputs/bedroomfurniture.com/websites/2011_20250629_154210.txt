back of truck, truck freight - threshold, and various levels of white glove services: small parcel - whenever possible we will ship smaller, lighter items via ups, fedex, dhl or usps. these companies provide the fastest and most reliable method of shipping available for many items we sell. depending on how close you are to the shipping warehouse, your item will arrive between 1 and 6 business days (1 to 10 business days for usps) after it leaves the warehouse. we do not require an adult signature for deliveries, but please note that the decision to leave your package without a signature is at the discretion of the delivery person. if you want an item left at your doorstep, the best thing to do is leave a note on your door asking the driver to leave your package with "no signature required." be sure to include your name and tracking number on the note. truck delivery - many items on our website are too large and/or heavy to ship via ups/fede, so they are shipped via truck delivery. truck delivery is different than standard ups, fedex, or us mail. once your merchandise arrives at the delivery agents pick-up location, the agent will call you to set up a delivery appointment. most truck delivery companies offer appointment windows (usually 2-4 hours) between 8:00am and 5:00pm est, monday through friday. upon receiving your delivery, please make sure that you inspect the package(s). if the box has any damage, or if there is any reason you are concerned with its packaging or delivery, please write, product damaged clearly on the sheet the delivery agent asks you to sign. this simply insures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the problem, and your problem will be solved as soon as possible. we offer two levels of truck delivery: self-service truck delivery - the products will be delivered to the driveway or curb outside of the delivery address provided upon purchase. we call it self service because youll need to move the package off of the truck yourself. you may want a friend or family member on hand for help liftgate services - standard self-service truck delivery requires you to move your items off the truck without any help. for only $50, our delivery service partners can be contracted to perform liftgate services, and bring the item(s) to the ground for you. one liftgate services fee of $50 will include all the items in your cart. examples of items that might ship this way are sofas, tables, or desks. delivery notes once your order is near, a rep from the shipping company will call and give you a 4-hour window to arrange for delivery. sometimes freight carriers offer their own services. once we send you your tracking info, you can call the carrier directly to get more info. please make sure that you inspect the package(s) at the time of delivery. if the box has any damage, or if there is any reason you are concerned with its packaging or delivery, please write, product damaged clearly on the sheet the delivery agent asks you to sign. this simply insures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the problem, and your order will be fulfilled as soon as possible. truck freight threshold - this method is just like "truck freight - back of truck" (see above), only the truck freight company will deliver your order to the threshold if yours is a residential delivery (this means to your garage or front door), or to the loading dock if yours is a commercial delivery. unfortunately, they are not authorized to perform any assembly services nor can they put it in the room of your choice. once we email you the tracking information you can contact the shipper directly to arrange for any additional services that you would like. you will be responsible for directly paying the truck freight carrier for these additional services. white glove freight - many large or fragile items will be delivered by a white glove freight carrier to ensure the safest and most convenient delivery. please note: a white glove delivery team consists of at least two people so you will not be burdened with carrying your order from the back of the truck to your home. once your order arrives in your area, a representative from the white glove carrier will call you to arrange a 4 hour window for delivery. you must inspect your package at the time of delivery. if the product has any damage or if you are concerned there may be damage, please write "product damaged" on the sheet you are asked to sign. this ensures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to resolve the problem. white glove delivery options front door service delivery to: inside the threshold of your residence. your product will be delivered to your front entrance, the product will not be carried up stairs inside the home. if you live in an apartment above the first floor of a building, we recommend upgrading to room of choice or room of choice with packaging removal. assembly service: none packaging: the product will be left in the original packaging. room of choice delivery to: a two-man team will bring the item inside your residence to the room you choose. this includes carrying the product up two flights of stairs from the building threshold (4-15 steps = 1 flight). if you need the product moved up additional flights, please contact us*. assembly: none packaging: the product will be left in the original packaging. room of choice with packaging removal delivery to: inside your residence to the room you choose. this includes carrying the product up two flights of stairs from the building threshold (4-15 steps = 1 flight). if you need the product moved up additional flights, please contact us*. assembly service: the shipper will unpack the product and provide basic setup that requires no tools (i.e. set pieces next to each other, or on top of each other). packaging: the shipper will remove and dispose of all packaging. assembly service delivery to: inside your residence to the room you choose. this includes carrying the product up two flights of stairs from the building threshold (4-15 steps = 1 flight). if you need the product moved up additional flights, please contact us*. assembly service: the shipper will unpack the product and provide light setup that requires basic tools (i.e. pieces will be screwed or bolted together, set pieces next to each other, or on top of each other). packaging: the shipper will remove and dispose of all packaging. *in all cases the shipper will not hook up any electrical or component wires. having items carried up more than 25 steps and longer assembly periods are available as additional services which would require additional charges. please contact us if you feel you need these services. when will my order arrive? every product on our site has an estimated lead time -
