formerly a best-kept secret, csn starts to make news with such selection, savings and service, many have said that csn stores is the best-kept secret in online shopping. that's largely because the company's founders wanted to concentrate their efforts on building a strong operation, instead of promoting their new venture each step of the way as many start-ups do. but after more than five years of building the company, the founders responded to ongoing demands from customers, the media and others to come out and tell the csn stores story. we started telling the story about a year ago and weve received a very warm reception from the media and consumers. and were gaining more momentum every month. csn stores' sites and products have been featured in outlets including: the today show
