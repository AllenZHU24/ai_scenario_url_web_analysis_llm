care for my jewelry? since 1837, tiffany & co. has maintained the highest standards in design, materials and craftsmanship, creating jewelry that has been passed down from generation to generation. with some simple, basic care, you can help preserve and protect your jewelry for years to come. over time, fine jewelry can become a treasured family heirloom if it is cared for properly. dust, pollution and daily wear all conspire to cloud the brilliance of gemstones. the surface of gold, platinum and silver jewelry can become dulled. timeworn prongs and clasps can result in the loss of a stone or an entire piece of jewelry. professional cleanings are recommended as often as once a year. we encourage you to bring your tiffany & co. jewelry back to us for professional servicing. our staff is knowledgeable and experienced in all aspects of jewelry care, including cleaning gemstones, restringing pearls and repairing clasps and earring backs. tiffany & co. sterling silver jewelry tiffany only uses sterling silver, one of the most beautiful and lustrous of all metals. sterling silver is a precious metal and may require cleaning from time to time. with proper care, your silver will retain its beauty and character for many generations to come. the first rule of silver care sterling silver tarnishes, especially when exposed to salt air and products containing sulfur, such as rubber bands and some papers. however, silver that is regularly used typically needs less care, so tiffany strongly encourages you to wear your silver every day. general silver care using a small amount of tiffany’s silver jewelry cleaner on a soft cloth, gently rub the silver several times. then rinse the silver thoroughly in warm water and carefully dry. this will remove the tarnish and dullness, keeping your sterling silver like new. please note: chlorine and bleach accelerate tarnishing and should be avoided. special considerations an oxidized finish is the deliberate blackening of crevices in the ornamentation of a silver object to make its decorative details stand out more clearly. take care as this finish can be removed by overzealous cleaning and polishing. storing silver once cleaned and polished, silver must be kept dry and properly stored. our tiffany blue® flannel bags will protect it from abrasion and offer a degree of tarnish prevention. bags made of pacific cloth are also very effective in preventing tarnish. silver polishing services are available for sterling silver jewelry, flatware and hollowware items manufactured by tiffany & co. if you wish to have your silver polished, please contact your nearest tiffany & co. store or call customer service at 800 843 3269. view customer service hours gold and platinum jewelry between professional servicing, most gold and platinum jewelry can be maintained with a non-abrasive cleaner. examine your jewelry regularly to make sure settings are snug and clasps and joinings are secure. avoid exposing gold jewelry to household bleach, which will quickly cause gold to discolor and possibly disintegrate. jewelry storage is important as well. at the time of purchase, all tiffany & co. jewelry is wrapped in a protective box, case or tarnish-resistant pouch. between wearings, we recommend that you place it back in its original case or another suitably lined box or pouch. gemstone jewelry certain basic precautions should be taken with all of your jewelry. however, some gemstones, as outlined in this section, require special care. take care to protect your jewelry from impact against hard surfaces and avoid contact with abrasive surfaces. even a diamond can chip if hit with enough force or at just the right angle. many stones such as amethyst, emerald, kunzite, opal, pearl, peridot, tanzanite and tourmaline are very delicate and easily abraded. enamel can also chip or scratch when struck. gemstones can scratch other gemstones and wear away at precious metals. therefore, avoid stacking those rings and bracelets that would be vulnerable to such abrasion. extreme temperatures, perfumes, cosmetics, ultrasonic cleaning and household chemicals can also damage jewelry. to clean diamonds, use a mild solution of six parts water to one part ammonia and apply with a soft bristle brush. if worn often, pearls should be cleaned and restrung professionally once a year. between cleanings, wipe pearls gently with a damp cloth. download full gemstone care pdf rubedo® metal jewelry a unique tiffany metal, rubedo® metal captures the rose luminescence of dawn. maintaining the beauty of this radiant metal is simple and with proper care, your rubedo® metal designs can last for generations. rubedo® metal care like sterling silver, rubedo® metal can tarnish, especially when exposed to salt air and products containing sulfur, such as rubber bands and some papers. to remove tarnish or fingerprints on rubedo® metal, use tiffany silver polish or another quality brand. some “dip” polishes contain harsh chemicals and should be avoided. electrolytic cleaning (aluminum foil, salt and baking soda in a water base) is not recommended. begin by using a soft cloth or sponge to apply the polish. rub each piece gently but firmly lengthwise, using straight, even strokes. wash in sudsy water, being sure to remove all the polish. rinse well in warm water, dry thoroughly and buff gently with a soft cloth. storing rubedo® metal once cleaned and polished, rubedo® metal must be kept and properly stored. our tiffany blue® flannel bags will protect it from abrasion and offer a degree of tarnish prevention. bags made of pacific cloth are also very effective in preventing tarnish. if the climate is humid, place a small packet of demoisturizing crystals (e.g., silica gel) inside the bag. how do i measure ring size? tiffany & co. uses standard u.s. ring sizes. refer to our measurement chart or the ruler found in our size guide here. how can i make returns or exchanges?
