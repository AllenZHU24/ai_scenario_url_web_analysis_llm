since tiffany & co. introduced the tiffany® setting in 1886, it has defined the engagement ring as we know it today. how to choose an engagement ring? choose a design that reflects your loved one’s style, from a classic to an ornate design. in addition, a tiffany diamond expert can guide you through the 4cs—cut, color, clarity and carat weight—which may factor into choosing your ring. what is a ring setting? a setting refers to how gemstones are mounted in a metal band. tiffany’s talented artisans expertly craft every ring setting to fit the unique diamond and highlight its beauty. among the house’s renowned settings are our legendary tiffany® setting, signature tiffany true® setting and classic styles such as solitaire, prong, bead, pavé, cathedral or burnish settings. what are the different diamond shapes? diamond shape refers to the geometric appearance of a diamond and is categorized into two groups: round diamonds and fancy shape diamonds. leading the industry, tiffany offers a triple excellent cut on all round brilliant diamonds. fancy shape diamonds include pear, oval, princess-cut, cushion-cut, emerald-cut, marquise and heart. among the house’s exclusive shapes is the tiffany true® diamond, which combines a step-cut crown and a brilliant-cut pavilion. what is the three-month rule for engagement rings? the three-month salary rule is a traditional idea that a partner should spend three months’ salary on an engagement ring. at tiffany, we believe in choosing the ring that best reflects your love rather than meeting a price threshold. sign out of sales
