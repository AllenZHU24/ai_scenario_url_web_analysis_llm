to draw profound beauty out of a stone requires ultimate control from mine to finger. along the way, there are thousands of decisions made that bring life, fire and brilliance to a diamond. only tiffany could pursue perfection with such relentless dedication and commitment to craft.the tiffany promisethe superlative beauty of tiffany’s engagement diamonds is the result of strict quality standards and our obsession with creating the most beautiful diamonds at every step. but beyond the 4cs (cut, clarity, color and carat weight), at tiffany we understand that it takes a human being to breathe life into a stone.our craftsmen see the beauty in every tiffany diamond, and work with passion and precision to unleash intense vibrancy and light. we are so deeply committed to this pursuit of perfection that we entrust this work only to the most talented hands. every ring is handcrafted, just as it’s been done for over 130 years, which is why it takes nearly a year—from the moment the diamond is discovered until the design is finished—to make an engagement ring that is worthy of the tiffany name.the strict standards of tiffany brillianceevery diamond is special when you consider that it was formed deep in the earth billions of years ago. and each diamond, like a human fingerprint, has certain distinguishing characteristics such as color, clarity and carat weight. but what brings life and soul into a diamond is the cut.cut clarity color carat weight tiffany diamond shapescutat tiffany, we cut our own diamonds. we take the world’s highest quality rough diamonds and put them in the hands of the world’s best stonecutters. these skilled artisans craft the best-proportioned diamonds instead of the heaviest diamonds, ensuring that each and every stone’s full potential is unlocked. they ensure the precise positioning, shape and angle of each of the diamond’s facets to maximize brilliance and fire.tiffany diamond cutters refuse to compromise. when the choice is size or beauty, we always choose beauty, so that we outshine all others.tiffany’s diamonds are brighter and more vibrant because we craft them that way. and only the most perfectly cut diamonds earn the right to be placed in the legendary tiffany blue box®.in fact, we are so confident in the superb quality of our diamonds that we stand behind them with a lifetime warranty.tablethe large facet in the center of the crown of a polished diamond. the shape of the table varies based on a diamond’s cut. on a round brilliant-cut diamond, the table is octagonal in shape.girdlethe narrow band that circumscribes the edge where crown and pavilion meet. the girdle may be polished or gently bruted.pavilionthe portion of the diamond below the girdle, including the culet.culeta small, protective facet cut on the point of the pavilion. on some brilliant-cut diamonds, the facet is octagonal. on the keel of some step-cut diamonds, the facet is rectangular.crownthe upper part of a diamond, above the girdle plane.too deepperfect proportiontoo shallowperfect symmetryoff-center table and misaligned facets flawless eye-visible inclusionsclaritydiamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification. a stone is graded as flawless if, under 10-power magnification, no inclusions (internal flaws) and no blemishes (external imperfections) are visible. absolutely flawless diamonds are exceedingly rare and priced accordingly.tiffany’s strict diamond grading standards are executed with expertise, integrity and accuracy. when tiffany believes that a diamond’s clarity is on the borderline between two grades, tiffany will always assign the stone a lower grade—never falsely inflating a diamond’s clarity grade.tiffany rejects any diamond with noticeable imperfections to the unaided eye.tiffany diamonds clarity gradeflflawlessifinternally flawlessvvs1 vvs2very, very slightly includedvs1 vs2very slightly includedsi1 si2slightly includedi1 i2 i3imperfecttiffany qualitycolorcolor refers to the tint of the diamond. in nature, most diamonds have a slight tint of yellow or brown color. the closer to being “colorless” a diamond is, the rarer it is. the industry standard for grading color is to evaluate each stone against a “master set” and assign a letter grade from “d” (colorless) to “z” (light yellow).tiffany only accepts diamonds in the “colorless” and “near colorless” range on a diamond color scale.borderline diamond color classifications are automatically given the more conservative grade. additionally, the tiffany gemological laboratory will not accept stones exhibiting strong or excessive fluorescence, which, in natural lighting, can give diamonds a milky appearance.diamond color charttiffany quality cut_round .25 cut_round .50 cut_round 1.00 cut_round 1.50 cut_round 2.00 cut_round 2.50 carat weighttiffany diamonds are always cut to maximize brilliance, not carat weight. “carat” denotes the weight of a diamond.one carat equals .20 grams. tiffany measures diamonds to 1/1000th of a carat. taken by itself, carat weight does not determine a diamond’s value. for example, two one-carat stones can vary widely in price when clarity, color and cut are taken into consideration. when that is understood, it is clear that large diamonds of peerless quality are rare and priced accordingly.tiffany diamond shapesover the course of a lifetime, you will look at your engagement ring over one million times. the stone, setting and shape should reflect your unique style and relationship.tiffany offers a wide range of diamond cuts to enhance the beauty of each shape, ensuring that every ring is as extraordinary as the love it
