product caregeneral care / sterling silver / gold, platinum / gemstones / leather / rubedo® metalgeneral careover time, fine jewelry can become a treasured family heirloom if it is cared for properly. dust, pollution and daily wear all conspire to cloud the brilliance of gemstones. the surface of gold, platinum and silver jewelry can become dulled. timeworn prongs and clasps can result in the loss of a stone or an entire piece of jewelry. professional cleanings are recommended as often as once a year. we encourage you to bring your tiffany & co. jewelry back to us for professional servicing. our staff is knowledgeable and experienced in all aspects of jewelry care, including cleaning gemstones, restringing pearls and repairing clasps and earring backs.sterling silvertiffany only uses sterling silver, one of the most beautiful and lustrous of all metals. with proper care, your silver will retain its beauty and character for many generations to come. the first rule of silver caresterling silver tarnishes, especially when exposed to salt air and products containing sulfur, such as rubber bands and some papers. however, silver that is regularly used typically needs less care, so tiffany strongly encourages you to use or wear your silver every day. washing silvertiffany recommends washing silver by hand in warm water with a mild detergent. because many food acids and gases in the air can have a corrosive effect, we suggest that you wash your silver immediately after use. silverware, and especially knives, should not be left to soak in water. to avoid spotting, it is important to dry your silver immediately after washing. polishing silveruse tiffany silver polish or another quality brand. some "dip" polishes contain harsh chemicals and should be avoided. electrolytic cleaning (aluminum foil, salt and baking soda in a water base) is not recommended. begin by using a soft cloth or sponge to apply the polish. rub each piece gently but firmly lengthwise, using straight, even strokes. you may use a small brush (like a toothbrush with natural bristles) for decorative trim or borders. wash in sudsy water, being sure to remove all the polish. rinse well in warm water, dry thoroughly and buff gently with a soft cloth. special considerationsan "oxidized" finish is the deliberate blackening of crevices in the ornamentation of a silver object to make its decorative details stand out more clearly. take care as this finish can be removed by overzealous cleaning and polishing. storing silveronce cleaned and polished, silver must be kept dry and properly stored. our tiffany blue flannel bags will protect it from abrasion and offer a degree of tarnish prevention. bags made of "pacific" cloth are also very effective in preventing tarnish. when storing flatware in flannel rolls, be sure it is absolutely dry. if the climate is humid, place a small packet of demoisturizing crystals (e.g., silica gel) inside the roll.gold, platinumbetween professional servicing, most gold and platinum jewelry can be maintained with a non-abrasive cleaner. examine your jewelry regularly to make sure settings are snug and clasps and joinings are secure. avoid exposing gold jewelry to household bleach, which will quickly cause gold to discolor and possibly disintegrate. jewelry storage is important as well. at the time of purchase, all tiffany & co. jewelry is wrapped in a protective box, case or tarnish-resistant pouch. between wearings, we recommend that you place it back in its original case or another suitably lined box or pouch.gemstonescertain basic precautions should be taken with all of your jewelry. however, some gemstones, as outlined in this section, require special care. take care to protect your jewelry from impact against hard surfaces and avoid contact with abrasive surfaces. even a diamond can chip if hit with enough force or at just the right angle. many stones such as amethyst, emerald, kunzite, opal, pearl, peridot, tanzanite and tourmaline are very delicate and easily abraded. enamel can also chip or scratch when struck. gemstones can scratch other gemstones and wear away at precious metals. therefore, avoid stacking those rings and bracelets that would be vulnerable to such abrasion. extreme temperatures, perfumes, cosmetics, ultrasonic cleaning and household chemicals can also damage jewelry. to clean diamonds, use a mild solution of six parts water to one part ammonia and apply with a soft bristle brush. if worn often, pearls should be cleaned and restrung professionally once a year. between cleanings, wipe pearls gently with a damp cloth. download full gemstone care pdfleatherthe leather and materials used to craft your tiffany merchandise are natural products sourced from the finest tanneries and fabric mills in the world. slight imperfections and color variations may occasionally appear, enhancing the beauty and uniqueness of your piece. external elements such as excessive heat or moisture can affect the overall look of your accessory. following proper care and storage guidelines will ensure the longevity of this exceptional product. when not in use, store your item in the protective dust bag provided. calf and grain leatherleather has inherent slight variations and imperfections, which are normal and add to the beauty of each piece. the grain leather is treated naturally, so color and texture may change over time, darkening and softening to create an elegant patina. if scuffs or bruises occur, rub the affected area with a soft, dry white cloth. patent leather:to avoid color transfer, do not rest patent accessories against one another. if leather becomes dirty, clean with a damp white cloth and a small amount of mild soap. for stains, oil-based spots and spills, follow the instructions below. canvas:if necessary, spot-clean with a damp white cloth and a small amount of mild soap. as with any cotton product, if canvas is repeatedly exposed to direct sunlight, a softening of color may occur. for stains, oil-based spots and spills, follow the instructions below. caring for calf, grain and patent leathers and canvas:always test any cleaning method in a hidden area first. never use saddle soap, oils, hairdryers, abrasive cleaners, furniture polish, varnish or ammonia. for stains:use a mild solution of soap and water (ten parts water to one part soap). apply gently with a wet white cloth and then fully rinse. let air dry. for oil-based spots:blot oil spots with a clean, dry white cloth. the spot should dissipate into the leather shortly. do not apply water to the marks. for other spots and spills:immediately remove the spill or spot with a clean, absorbent white cloth or sponge. if stain persists, use plain lukewarm water to carefully clean the spot. blot with a clean towel, then air dry. suede:the rawness of suede makes it a unique but delicate material. if stain or color transfers occur, use a soft brush to gently rub the affected area. remove dry stains and marks from suede by gently rubbing a clean pencil eraser on the affected area. for wet stains, lay a paper towel on top of stain to absorb most of the liquid. do not apply any kind of stain remover or other products. haircalf:this is a delicate material. please be aware that over time, balding may occur in high impact areas. it is difficult to prevent this as it is entirely dependent on the individual animal skin. try to protect from exposure to direct sunlight, sharp objects and excessive heat. to ensure longevity, be gentle with your haircalf item and store it in the protective dust bag provided when not in use. care should be exercised when cleaning haircalf. use a damp white cloth and wipe with the hair, and not against the natural lay of the hair. for best results, avoid vigorous rubbing and do not use saddle soap or other leather cleaners.rubedo® metala unique tiffany metal, rubedo® captures the rose luminescence of dawn. maintaining the
