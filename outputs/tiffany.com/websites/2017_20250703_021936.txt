ringsprincessa princess cut is shaped like an inverted pyramid and sometimes referred to as a square modified brilliant.browse princess-cut engagement ringsround brilliantarguably the quintessential diamond, and certainly among the most radiant, a round brilliant cut features 57 or 58 facets, made up of kite-shaped, star and triangular facets. the girdle of this shape may be either faceted or bruted. it may or may not have a culet on the pavilion.browse round brilliant engagement ringspearalso referred to as a “teardrop” shape, this brilliant-cut diamond features a pear-shaped outline with two curved sides, one rounded end and one pointed end.browse pear-shaped engagement rings carat weight“carat” denotes the weight of a diamond. taken by itself, carat does not determine a diamond’s value. two diamonds of equal weight can vary widely in price. tiffany diamonds are always cut to maximize brilliance, not carat weight. true to our higher standards, beauty trumps size every time. colorthe ideal engagement ring is clear. diamonds may appear colorless, but minute impurities within each stone create subtle tints of color. each stone is color-graded to a precise scale from “d” (colorless) to “z” (saturated). only diamonds of color “i” (near colorless) or better are accepted by tiffany. important notelights, pleasewhen grading color, we use ultraviolet light to expose a diamond’s fluorescence. a stone that has strong or excessive fluorescence will have a milky appearance in natural lighting. these do not meet the tiffany quality distinction and are not accepted by the tiffany gemological laboratory. reset claritya stone is graded as flawless if, under 10-power magnification, no internal flaws (clouds, feathers, pinpoints) and no external imperfections (scratches, pits, nicks) are visible. absolutely flawless diamonds are exceedingly rare and priced accordingly. flawless eye-visible inclusionspresenceit all adds up to tiffany’s exclusive fifth quality standard. “presence” encompasses precision of cut, symmetry and polish which, collectively, profoundly influence a diamond’s brilliance, dispersion, scintillation and overall appearance.ready for your next step?now that you know your round brilliant diamond from your cushion cut, the real romance starts. use your new know-how to find the style that’s just right for your true love.explore
