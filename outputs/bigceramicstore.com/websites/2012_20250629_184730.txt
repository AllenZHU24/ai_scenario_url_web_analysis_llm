================================================================================

about big ceramic store we strive to create a great customer experience.  but a company is only as good as it's employees. fortunately we've got great employees who really care about our customers.  some of these employees are "behind the scenes", doing things like packing your orders so they arrive safely.  others are front and center, dealing with customers like you for most of their day.  if you call or email us, chances are you're going to talk to gordon, kris, or angela. gordon - operations manager gordon moved from michigan to lake tahoe so he could be close to skiing and mountain biking.  in addition to keeping our warehouse stocked, he processes all the orders and generally keeps the place running.  so if we're out of stock on something or you entered the wrong address, you're likely to hear from gordon.  just don't try to reach him in the morning on a powder day, because he'll be at the slopes! history we (the owners) are a husband and wife team in reno, nevada.  i'm cindi, and i'm an amateur potter who was frustrated when i couldn't buy my studio supplies on-line.  so glen and i left our high-tech jobs to build the website (no trivial task with 10000+ items, photos and shopping cart tags) and try starting a business. well, it worked!  over the twelve years we have been in business, we have grown consistently.  we have hired employees, opened our own warehouse, added new products...  all so that day after day we can ship orders to customers around the world.  in fact we're one of the largest ceramic suppliers in the country! in addition to making a living, we try to make it easier for people to become involved in ceramics, and to learn to appreciate it as an art form.  we hope to make it easier for experienced potters to meet each other, and to help those new to the field.   and we hope that by providing everyone easy access to the tools they need, they can focus on the creative and practical aspects of making ceramics.it's not always easy to compete in an internet world where there's usually someone willing to undercut your price by a few dollars.  (particularly smaller suppliers that don't stock anything and just drop ship.) we do offer great prices, but sometimes we're not the absolute lowest.  however, we think it's more important to be able to offer great service: to help people choose what they need, to help people solve problems they are having, to write tips and how-to's, to answer our emails and phones.  so we try to strike a balance, and fortunately most of our customers appreciate the extras.  thanks for your business!  may your head be full of ideas and your hands full of clay... cindi & glen our original partnership was named wigglydog productions, after buddy our adopted golden retriever, who was always wiggling with excitement and reminding us to do the things we love to do. (except when he was busy reviewing orders as you see here.) unfortunately businesses last longer than dogs, so buddy is no longer with us. home contact us ordering info product index clearance sale new items newsletters/tips colors tools kilns wheels equipment warm glass firing accessories finishing accessories airbrushes banding wheels bats bisque books brushes casting slip chemicals cink  clay clay guns dvd's extruders firing supplies giffin grips gift certificates   glaze grinders handbuilding tools glaze mixers  kemper tools kilns kiln accessories kiln elements kiln parts mixer/puggers mkm tools molds for clay molds for glass  mudtools orton cones overglaze peter puggers pottery wheels pug mills resists scales sieves slabmat slab rollers  slumphump molds sponges sprayers spray guns stains stools texture tools tile tables throwing tools tongs  underglaze  ugpencils & pens ware carts wood tile trivets & boxes xiem tools not all items shown here.  for more, please select productindex or category links above..
