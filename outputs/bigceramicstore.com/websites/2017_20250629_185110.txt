once the auction is live, the item is offered for what we think is a great price - if it doesn't sell at that original price, then we drop the price until it's sold or we withdraw it from the auction - that means that an item can sell at any time -- there is not set deadline like with typical 'normal' auctions so don't wait too long to decide, or someone else will take your deal !! time left until price drop (if no bid is received): contact big ceramic store llc543 vista blvd sparks, nv 89434 e-mail support@bigceramicstore.com phone 888-513-5303 fax 775-403-2241 support form my account sign in newsletter wishlist company info about us careers our team affiliate page customer service help and faqs “how-to”s gift certificates contact us terms and policies shipping policy return policy privacy policy terms of use {{label}} {{label}} information close x an error occured close x back to top
