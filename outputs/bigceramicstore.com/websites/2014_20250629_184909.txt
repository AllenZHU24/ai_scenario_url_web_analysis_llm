(this extra time usually applies to cashiers checks and money orders as well.) sales taxwe collect sales tax on orders shipped to nevada. the cart adds the highest nevada tax rate, but it gets adjusted to the correct rate for your city when we import it into our database. there are a few items which are drop shipped where we collect sales tax in other states. these are stated on the specific page.there are a few products for which we collect sales tax in states besides nevada. we will contact you for approval if that occurs with your order. when we charge your credit cardfor smaller items:if you are paying by credit card (not check or p.o.), we "pre-authorize" your charges during the checkout process. this verifies that the card information has been entered correctly, that the card is valid, and that you have not reached your card limit. if everything is ok, we "reserve" the amount shown in your shopping cart on that credit card. the card is not actually charged at this point.we review every order before we actually charge your card. so if you have items which ship by truck and need a shipping quote, or if you have some notes to us in the comments, or if there are any pricing adjustments necessary, we take care of all this before actually charging your card.if you are having any trouble getting the shopping cart to accept your credit card, first check the 3 or 4 digit security code. this changes when you get issued replacement cards, and is the most common problem. if you still cannot get it to work, back out and select "pay by check". this will get us your order and we can contact you to resolve the credit card issue.sometimes (usually with visa check cards) people have daily limits that can be charged, and we have to spread large charges over several days. we are happy to do this for you.for larger items including all equipment, see special orders - credit card charges below. chargebacks and stop paymentsrefusing to pay for product you have received or fees you have agreed to pay is a form of theft. we cannot afford to absorb such theft without raising our prices. therefore each incident of a check being returned will result in a $50 bounced check fee. each time you charge back a payment to your credit card, even if it is in error, per posted policy you agree to a $75 administrative and research service fee. these fees are in addition to any applicable fees and monies due on your order per our policies. should stop payment fees, chargeback fees or any other order charges, cancellation fees or restocking fees not be paid, the debt will be sent to collections and if unpaid be reported to the credit bureaus. we will prosecute all incidents of fraud or theft. note that if you chargeback an item to your credit card, you are still responsible for payment of that item. we will send you to collections which among other things may result in a court appearance and/or reporting the unpaid debt to the credit bureaus. back orderswe stock a great many of the items we sell, so most orders will be filled and shipped quickly. however we cannot guarantee that any particular item will be in stock at any time. below is our policy on filling orders.orders where all items are temporarily out of stock will be held until ready for shipping, with a notification sent by email.if your order includes both in and out of stock items, but can likely be shipped in-full within a week, we may hold the entire order until all items are available.if we don't expect to have all items within a week, as a courtesy we'd be happy to split your order into multiple shipments free of charge.if you're working under a deadline or require items by a certain date, please let us know in the order comments and we'll do our best to accommodate you.* we may occasionally deviate from these criteria/rules when it makes sense for the situation, but our goal is to operate as described.shipping general shipping informationshippingclick to shipping options and delivery times!for non-equipment orders, your shipping will be calculated at checkout after you enter your state/province and zip/postal code. checkout uses the weight and size of the items and your destination to calculate these rates.in the continental us, our primary shipping method is ups. ups is economical, and packages are insured and tracked. however, we may use the postal service at our discretion. this will not affect your shipping cost and you will still be charged the amount that was in your shopping cart at the time of order.for equipment orders that do not include free shipping or orders weighing more than 199 pounds, you may place your order at checkout and we will contact you afterwards with shipping options and rates.international shipping, including canada, is currently not calculated at checkout. you may place your order at checkout and we will contact you afterwards with shipping options and rates. if you have any questions, please email or call our customer service at support@bigceramicstore.com or 888-513-5303. we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.most orders are shipped and processed within the same day or 24 hours from the moment we receive them, but definitely not all. if you order pass 3pm pacific, you order will be processed the next business day. another reason for the delay is that sometimes items are out of stock, and if we expect them soon we will hold the order until they arrive. otherwise, we will split your shipment free of cost. for orders to alaska, hawaii, us territories or outside of the us, we will notify you and hold your order until all items are in stock.other items such as kilns are typically custom-made and can take anywhere from one to six weeks for delivery. if you need something by a certain date, please make sure you let us know so we can inform you if this is possible. type your requested or required delivery date in the comments and we will let you know as soon as possible.heavy or fragile items (such as most kilns, wheels, and pug mills, slab rollers, and large quantities of clay or chemicals) ship by truck. in many cases, free shipping is included. if shipping is not included, you can email us for a quote, or submit your order and we will email you a quote for your approval.when free shipping is offered, it applies to most destinations in the continental us. it does not include hi, ak or us territories, or any international destinations. it also does not include some remote areas in the continental us. if you're curious about the location where you live, please email and ask us about it. (note: it is very unusual for an address in the continental us to not be covered by the free shipping. manhattan and islands that can only be reached by boat or airplane are the most common). if free shipping is not included, we will apply a credit equal to free shipping in the continental us and send you the difference for your approval.undeliverable or returned packages:please check your address carefully. if a package shipped to you is not deliverable at the address you provided, you will be charged a $9.95 re-addressing fee. that assumes they are able to correct the address and deliver the package. if the address cannot be corrected and the package is returned to us, you will be charged for both the original shipping cost, and the return shipping cost. please double-check the addresses you provide when ordering. for truck shipments, similar rules apply, but at possibly higher cost, as it varies from carrier to carrier.alaska and hawaii customers:we can ship your items by usps priority mail. please request it in the comments when you check out, and we will let you know the options and rates. we will use flat rate boxes whenever possible kiln ordersall non-120 volt kiln orders will be confirmed prior to shipment. this is to assure you ordered the options and features you wanted, in particular the voltage and phase. most kilns are built to order, non-cancelable, and non-returnable. if you need to cancel your kiln order after we submit it to the manufacturer, and before it ships, it may be possible to cancel for a cancellation/restocking fee. this is dependent on the policies of the manufacturer and the costs that we have incurred, and will be handled on a case by case basis. in no case will the cancellation fee be less than 15%. most kilns are custom made and take 2-6 weeks plus transit time. smaller kilns usually take less than larger kilns. if you need a kiln faster, please ask us what we have in stock. or sometimes we can have kilns rush built so you can get it by a certain date.when you purchase a non 120v kiln, or most items that ship by truck, you will receive an email from us with questions about your delivery and any questions about product options. here are our instruction on receiving kilns. please read these when ordering and refer to these when your kiln is being delivered. international ordersplease note: international shipping, including canada, is currently not calculated at checkout. you may place your order at checkout and we will contact you afterwards with shipping options and rates. if you have any questions, please email or call our customer service at support@bigceramicstore.com or 888-513-5303. we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.canada: we offer the ups e-tailer brokerage program (ebp) to canadian customers. the ebp offers a flat brokerage rate of $10.00.  to qualify shipments must be less than $200 (canadian value), and must be shipped via the standard method (ground to canada) for non-commercial end (or residential) use.the official description of the ebp from ups:“canada customs requires canadian recipients to pay applicable duties and taxes on each shipment entering canada. these charges may include pst, gst, hst, duties and other taxes of goods (e.g. excise tax). a brokerage fee is also charged to process shipments and present the requisite customs paperwork to canada customs on the importer’s behalf.your order will be shipped under ups’s e-tailer brokerage program (ebp), where eligible shipments imported into canada for non-commercial purposes and valued under cad$ 200 shipped via ups standard service are subject to a reduced brokerage fee of cad$ 10, plus any applicable duties and taxes. shipments valued at cad$200 and above and/or being imported to canada for commercial purposes and/or subject to specialized clearance may incur additional fees.please, be aware that ups will request payment of these charges at the time of delivery. you have the ability to call ups ahead of time (1-800-742-5877) to pay these charges, eliminating the need for payment on delivery.”we also offer the worldwide expedited method to canada. customs brokerage fees are waived; however, your order will be subject to duties and other taxes of goods. the delivery commitment is two days.we ship heavy items such as kilns, pug mills, and slab rollers to canada. you may place your order at checkout and we will contact you afterwards with shipping options and rates. customers with these orders that do not ship via ups are required to have their own customs broker. we are not responsible for fees associated with international shipping. we recommend using pacific customs brokers for one time freight shipments to canada.free shipping, where offered, is not applicable to canada. we will apply a credit equal to free shipping in the us and send you the difference for your approval.rest of world: we ship internationally to more than 220 countries and territories via ups worldwide expedited. customs brokerage fees are waived;
