"they would work as a slump mold for making plates, platters, and bowls." so i picked up a couple and headed back to the studio. i don't know about you but i'm all about easy options for making larger pieces. that's one reason i love using styrofoam floral rings, the other reason is they are light, durable, and easy to store on a peg, taking up less of my shelf space! let's head to the studio and i will show you just how easy it is to make a plate without a lot of fuss! read more leave a comment making multiple clay handles when i was making my mugs and such, i used to make one handle at a time, however; i've discovered it's much more rewarding to make a bunch and have them ready to go. and... to make life even easier, i've recently discovered the kemper handle maker, which helps me make a ton of handles in a short amount of time! are you making mugs, jugs, pitchers, etc...? why not make all the handles at the same time so you can have them ready to attach, and... the best part... you can make them all look alike if you want! read more leave a comment clay blog review: august 2017 - pottery making info | http://www.potterymakinginfo.com/news/clay-blog-review-august-2017/ […] big ceramic store: making multiple clay handles […] string and underglaze for unique patterns every now and again something simple catches my eye and gives me an idea. for example, the other day i was in the studio stringing some coasters together when i saw the string sitting next to an underglaze bottle. as simple as this sounds... i loved the way the string was just a bit curly, organic, and messy... and it gave me an idea for designing a few pieces. here's what i came up with... read more leave a comment clay blog review: august 2017 - pottery making info | http://www.potterymakinginfo.com/news/clay-blog-review-august-2017/ […] big ceramic store: string and underglaze for unique patterns […] barn swallows for the wall living out in the country, barn swallows are a very common sight. watching them swoop down to the pond for a drink, or up into the rafters of my barn, have become one of my favorite pastimes. sitting on the porch the other day, watching them flutter around then swoop down for bugs and drinks, i thought...
