(you can see the low absorption numbers below on the porcelain and stoneware clay; for dinnerware you want less than 3%.) for sculpture you often want less shrinkage, and absorption doesn't matter. so then firing cone 10 clay at a lower temperature is ideal. sculpting clay is designed to have more "open" bodies so they don't get as dense as other clays. an advantage of using cone 10 clay is that you don't have to worry about over firing your clay if you forget what cone it is. for this reason, many studios and schools only allow cone 10 clay to be used for ceramic projects. cone 10 clay is also typically used for raku, even though raku is a low temp process. clays such as wso have good temperature shock absorption which is needed for raku. mid-fire stoneware and porcelain, which are the cone 5-6 clays listed here, can also be used at low fire or up to cone 6. (just not above cone 6.) everything mentioned about absorption above applies here too. for dinnerware it is best to use a cone 5-6 clay if you fire to cone 5-6. low-fire clay can only be fired up to cone 04, or sometimes a little higher. unlike mid and high fire, it never shrinks much or gets really strong and dense even when fired to its maximum temperature. the main advantage to using a low-fire clay when low firing is that your glazes may craze less than if you used a cone 6 or cone 10 clay. remember, you have to fire your glaze to the cone that is specified for that glaze, regardless what clay you use. just make sure you use a clay rated at least as high as the glaze. once you choose a particular cone of clay to use, you have decide on the specific clay body. we list what application each clay body is best for. usually you use smooth clay when throwing on the wheel, particularly for smaller projects like dinnerware. but for handbuilding, sculpting, and other larger projects, you use clay with more grit (grog or sand.) shipping: clay unfortunately is heavy, so especially if it's shipping far, the costs can add up. if you purchase large quantities, we will do a truck ship quote for you. we have especially good rates for most of the western states. if you purchase greater than 200 pounds of clay, but not a whole pallet, heavyweight discounts kick in and shipping goes down, usually 10-30%. this does not happen in the shopping cart, so you have to ask and we can calculated it for you. also, for smaller quantities such as a box or two, we can ship clay bu usps for $20 a box (each 50 lb.) our shopping cart can't do that either, so instead of ordering the clay, just type in the comments of the order which ones you want via usps. filter options glaze form wet glaze cone low fire (cone 04-06) mid - high fire (cone 5-6 & 10) glaze dinner-ware safe no clay shrink 0% - 10% 10.1% - 15% clay abs 0% - 10% 10.1% - 20% clay cone mid fire (cone 5) manufacturer amaco laguna minnesota clay price $10.00 - $19.99 $20.00 - $29.99 $30.00 - $39.99 $40.00 and above more payment information more shipping information for schools to order using a po and other useful information, go to our "for schools" page. for schools close my account sign in newsletter wishlist company info about us careers our team affiliate page customer service help and faqs “how-to”s gift certificates contact us terms and policies shipping policy return policy privacy policy terms of use stay connected facebook pinterest twitter big ceramic store supporting since 1999 {{label}} {{label}} information close x an error occured close x back to top
