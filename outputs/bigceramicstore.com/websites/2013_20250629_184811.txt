all so that day after day we can ship orders to customers around the world. in fact we're one of the largest ceramic suppliers in the country! bigceramicstore also strives to make it easier for people to become involved in ceramics, and to learn to appreciate it as an art form. we hope to make it easier for experienced potters to meet each other, and to help those new to the field. and, we hope that by providing everyone easy access to the tools they need, they can focus on the creative and practical aspects of making ceramics. it's not always easy to compete in an internet world where there's usually someone willing to undercut your price by a few dollars. (particularly smaller suppliers that don't stock anything and just drop ship.) we do offer great prices, but sometimes we're not the absolute lowest. however, we think it's more important to be able to offer great service: to help people choose what they need, to help people solve problems they are having, to write tips and how-to's, to answer our emails and phones. so we try to strike a balance, and fortunately most of our customers appreciate the extras. thanks for your business! may your head be full of ideas and your hands full of clay... contact supportsupport@bigceramicstore.comphone888-513-5303 fax 888-475-7837 support form close my account sign in newsletter wishlist company info about us careers customer service help and faqs “how-to”s gift certificates contact us terms and policies shipping policy return policy privacy policy terms of use stay connected facebook pinterest twitter big ceramic store supporting since 1999 {{label}} {{label}} information close x an error occured close x back to top
