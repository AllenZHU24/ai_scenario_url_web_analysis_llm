idea: we like to cut the individual color chips off of the charts and tape them to the corresponding glaze jars. that way, it's easy to tell with a quick glance what color glaze is inside the jar. you might want to buy two sets of color charts for the glazes you use most often; one to cut up, and a second one to save as a references. 5 item(s) show 12 20 40 80 all per page sort by relevance name price down amaco color charts $1.00 add to cart coyote cone 6 glazes color charts $0.50 add to cart duncan color chart $4.00 add to cart laguna color charts $1.50 add to cart spectrum color charts $1.25 add to cart 5 item(s) show 12 20 40 80 all per page sort by relevance name price down more payment information more shipping information for schools to order using a po and other useful information, go to our "for schools" page. for schools close my account sign in newsletter wishlist company info about us careers our team customer service help and faqs “how-to”s gift certificates contact us terms and policies shipping policy return policy privacy policy terms of use stay connected facebook pinterest twitter big ceramic store supporting since 1999 {{label}} {{label}} information close x an error occured close x back to top
