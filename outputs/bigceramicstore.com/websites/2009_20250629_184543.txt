about big ceramic store history we (the owners) are a husband and wife team in reno, nevada.  i'm cindi, and i'm an amateur potter who was frustrated when i couldn't buy my studio supplies on-line.  so glen and i left our high-tech jobs to build the website (no trivial task with 5000+ items, photos and shopping cart tags) and try starting a business. well, it worked!  over the ten years we have been in business, we have grown consistently.  we have hired employees, opened our own warehouse, added new products...  all so that day after day we can ship orders to customers around the world. in addition to making a living, we try to make it easier for people to become involved in ceramics, and to learn to appreciate it as an art form.  we hope to make it easier for experienced potters to meet each other, and to help those new to the field.   and we hope that by providing everyone easy access to the tools they need, they can focus on the creative and practical aspects of making ceramics.it's not always easy to compete in an internet world where there's usually someone willing to undercut your price by a few dollars.  (particularly smaller suppliers that don't stock anything and just drop ship.) we do offer great prices, but sometimes we're not the absolute lowest.  however, we think it's more important to be able to offer great service: to help people choose what they need, to help people solve problems they are having, to write tips and how-to's, to answer our emails and phones.  so we try to strike a balance, and hope our customers appreciate the extras.  thanks for your business!  may your head be full of ideas and your hands full of clay... cindi & glenour address is: 543 vista blvd sparks, nv 89434 our original partnership was name wigglydog productions, after buddy our adopted golden retriever, who was always wiggling with excitement and reminding us to do the things we love to do. (except when he was busy reviewing orders as you see here.) unfortunately businesses last longer than dogs, so buddy is no longer with us.  but we're on the prowl for another dog so stay tuned... home    contact us product index    clearance sale    kilns wheels large equipment small equipment & tools   accessories colors   firing accessories  glass acrylic paints   airbrushes banding wheels bats   bisque books  brushes chemicals clay   clay guns extruders gift certificates glaze    grinders handbuilding tools   mixers kemper tools kilns   kiln accessories  mixer/puggers molds mudtools   orton cones   overglaze pug mills   resists scales   sieves slabmat   slab rollers slip   slip trailing   slumphump molds   sponges sprayers  spray guns stains   stools & chairs tea pot handles tile tables   throwing tools tongs trivets   underglaze   ug pencils & pens   dvd's   wheels wood tile trays & boxes
