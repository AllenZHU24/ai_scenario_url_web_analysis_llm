well, glass kilns generally have a heat source in the lid, and are used for doing glass work like bottle slumping and glass beads. ceramic kilns have heating elements in the sidewalls, fire at a higher temperature, and are fairly easy to operate. electric ceramic kilns are used more often than any other type, and are great for beginners. gas fired kilns are a little more challenging to use. the “reduction” firing supports a richer range of color and effects like flashing. if you’re bored with the simplicity, and colors produced in the oxidation firing of the electric ceramic kiln, a gas kiln may be the choice for you. raku kilns are a little different, as they are the first step to the finished product. raku kilns are basically gas or electric ceramic kilns, with a lid safety cutoff switch, or winch for lifting the heating chamber. either feature is designed to allow for easier removal of the red hot pieces. do you work with glass and ceramics?
