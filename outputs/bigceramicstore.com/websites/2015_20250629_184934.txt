all so that day-after-day we can ship orders to customers around the world. in fact, we're one of the largest ceramic suppliers in the country! bigceramicstore also strives to make it easier for people to become involved in ceramics, and to learn to appreciate it as an art form. we hope to make it easier for experienced potters to meet each other, and to help those new to the field. and, we hope that by providing everyone easy access to the tools they need, they can focus on the creative and practical aspects of making ceramics. we do offer great prices (including some of the lowest shipping costs), but sometimes we're not the absolute lowest. we try to strike a balance between great prices and excellent customer service and we thank you for appreciating the little extras that we do. we take pride in offering exceptional service to help you choose what is right for you, to solve the problems you are having, to write valuable tips and how-to's, and to quickly answer your phone calls and emails. thanks for your business! may your head be full of ideas and your hands full of clay... about vertana vertana is a nyc-based e-commerce company that acquires, develops and consolidates the operations of online retailers with high potential for growth. vertana group repositions acquired niche e-commerce companies for expansion, while preserving the unique brand identities and deepening the customer interactions of the acquired businesses. vertana group is backed by 354 partners llc, an investment firm located in new york city. for more information, please visit http://www.vertanagroup.com. browse other vertana companies: collectable diecast serious puzzles serious chai serious sips contact supportsupport@bigceramicstore.comphone888-513-5303fax888-475-7837 support form close my account sign in newsletter wishlist company info about us careers our team customer service help and faqs “how-to”s gift certificates contact us terms and policies shipping policy return policy privacy policy terms of use stay connected facebook pinterest twitter big ceramic store supporting since 1999 {{label}} {{label}} information close x an error occured close x back to top
