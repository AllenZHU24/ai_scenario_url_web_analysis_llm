service. our story beautylish was founded in the fall of 2010 with a simple purpose—to create a community where beauty lovers could share their collective beauty wisdom. people loved it, and our community grew to hundreds of thousands in a few short months. beautylish rapidly became a valuable resource for the discovery of beauty products. yet the experience felt noticeably incomplete because we weren't able to assist our members in purchasing the amazing products they loved. this led us to launch our own online boutique in 2012. we feel that the world is not short of beauty products, stores, or stories, but somewhere along the way, it became short of specialness. beautylish exists to find exceptional products, tell the inspiring stories behind them, and deliver them with thoughtfulness. we believe an amazing customer experience is driven by a personal relationship with our customers. we are still in the early part of our journey. there are so many more stories to tell and relationships to build. we hope that you join us as our story unfolds. life at beautylish beautylish is a small team of fiercely dedicated people headquartered near union square in san francisco. we work together across teams to tell our brand stories while striving to deliver the beautylish signature experience for our customers. “at beautylish we're bringing back personal attention. it's exciting to combine artistry, technology and an understanding of individual needs to craft a memorable experience for each customer.” —sameer iyengar, co-founder “we love working with customers, not just to assist with order issues, but to bond over our shared love of beauty products. it’s rewarding to have the ability to make someone’s day, and even creating friendships along the way!” —seu mei fung, customer service “we really pride ourselves in bringing brands to beautylish that are artistry driven and the talk of the industry. we want both the artist and the enthusiast to be able to find
