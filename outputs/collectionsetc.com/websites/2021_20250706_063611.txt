arrives. please note that all horticulture items are shipped in a dormant state. at collections etc., we strive to send you the best quality product for the best price and we want to make sure you are happy with your new plant. to care for your plant after it has been received, refer to the plant guide that is provided with your new plant. most plants are picked and packed from a dormant state 3-5 days before they arrive to your door. once your plant is replanted at its new home it will begin to sprout new foliage within a few weeks. just give it time to set its roots before you expect new foliage. most plants bounce back fine. if a plant does not bounce back, please contact our customer care department at 1 (800) 582-5700 or email them at [email protected] there’s mold on my plant when it arrived. what do i do? while your bulb may appear it has a substance that looks like mold, we assure you that this does not affect your plants in any way. this appearance may occur due to the climate in the truck changing through different parts of the country. the substance generally wipes off with a damp towel. my plant has white stuff on the leaves. what is it? if the white is powder-like, it is most likely a type of mildew that can be taken care of with fungicide. if it is more like cotton, you may have a spidermite infestation and will need to get a pesticide. make sure to cover the entire plant-branches, the tops and undersides of each leaf-with your treatment. can i return a horticulture item? since horticulture items are living plants, we do apologize but they cannot be returned. up until a plant has been picked, packed and shipped out, it is in a protected growing environment for dormancy. once we remove the plant from this fragile state, it is expected to be planted into soil immediately upon receipt by the customer. any extended delay in planting may cause the plant to have unfavorable results. if you received a wrong plant or if you believe the plant arrived dead, please contact our customer care department at 1 (800) 582-5700 or email them at [email protected] for all other horticulture inquiries, please visit our live plant informational page.
