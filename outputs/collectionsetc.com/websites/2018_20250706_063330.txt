picked and packed from a dormant state 3-5 days before they arrive to your door. they might arrive in various forms - bareroot, bulb, field-grown division, cell, or in pots. being without sunlight and water can take a toll on the current foliage. this foliage may be yellow, wilted, or even drop off. this is completely normal, although you might think it appears dead. read through and follow the entire planting guide provided before proceeding to plant. once your plant is replanted at its new home it will begin to sprout new foliage within a few weeks. just give it time to set its roots before you expect new foliage. most plants bounce back fine. back to top q: there's mold on my plant when it arrived. what do i do? a: sometimes when bulbs and bareroot plants are shipped, white mold forms on them. this does not affect your plants in any way. it is just from the climate in the truck changing through different parts of the country. the mold generally wipes off with a damp towel. back to top q: my plant has white stuff on the leaves. what is it? a: if the white is powder-like, it is most likely a type of mildew that can be taken care of with fungicide.if it is more like cotton, you may have a spidermite infestation and will need to get a pesticide.make sure to cover the entire plant- branches, the tops and undersides of each leaf- with your treatment. back to top q: can i return a horticulture item? a: since horticulture items are living plants, we do apologize but they cannot be returned. up until a plant has been picked, packed and shipped out, it is in a protected growing environment for dormancy. once we remove the plant from this fragile state, it is expected to be planted into soil immediately upon receipt by the customer. any extended delay in planting may cause the plant to have unfavorable results. if you received a wrong plant or if you believe the plant arrived dead, please contact our customer care department at 620-584-8000 or email them at customerservice@collectionsetc.com back to top payment q: which credit cards do you accept? a: we accept visa, mastercard, american express, discover, and paypal. back to top q: can i use a merchandise certificate online? a: yes. there is an area available during check out that will allow the entry of a merchandise certificate that has been issued from winston brands incorporated or one of its affiliates. keep in mind, shipping and handling, processing fee, and any applicable sales tax must be paid for by credit card for online purchases. back to top q: when will my credit card be
