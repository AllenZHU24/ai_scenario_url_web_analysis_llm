bh cosmetics, bhcosmetics - authenticity guaranteed policy : 120 eye shadow palette bh customer service team is always here to help! call (888) 545 4744    or    send message 0 i just recently purchased the 88 color shimmer palette and the 88 matte color palette, i had been wanting them for the longest time but i admit was a little skeptical about ordering off this website, because i had never heard of it before. but after watching the video tutorials which i found very helpful i decided to make my purchase! my order arrived 5 days later and i was so excited when i saw the beautiful black box and even more impressed when i opened it up and both of my color palettes where packaged so tightly and neatly that i was sure there was no damage done in shipping and there wasn't! i have been using them everyday since and they are the only eyes shadows i own that i don't have to reapply every 8 hours they are durable, long lasting and beautiful. i have very sensitive skin and i have had no problems with them or irritations. i even got a little of the eyeshadow in my eye and it caused no problem! i will definitely be ordering more from here and i will recommend it to all of my friends! five star ratingfelipa s, arizona i've purchased my 120 palette and few months ago and i absolutely love it. i use it pretty much everyday. i havent quite used all the colors but my go too's are the red, pink, black and white and i love the colors, they last pretty much all day and they are sooo vibrant and stand out. i've gotten so many compliments about my makeup and i do recommend it to everyone. i do plan on buying more palettes i think my next one mite be neutral colors to experiement with, but i loveeeeee the product and keep up the good work five star ratingchristina winn, illinois omg!!! you guys are awesome! not only was the shipping super fast (2 days) but the packaging was fantastic not one eyeshadow chipped and i ordered 4 palettes ( standard matte, standard shimmer, cool matte and cool shimmer plus the eye & lip primer) of course i was skeptical bcuz this is the first time i've ever ordered makeup online and the very first time i ordered from bh cosmetics and it most certainly wont be the last, the colors were even better than the pictures on the website and their so pigmented its great i just did a swatch test with my finger to try one out and the results were amazing! being a woman of color its hard to find colors that look even some what decent that stay on and don't crease or fade or even stand out against my skin tone (which isn't dark but its not light either) for a good price i've been using mac and smashbox and shopping at stores like ulta for years and this product stands with the best of them!, i couldn't believe that these colors looked so bright without primer, its been hours and i still have them on with no sign of fading in sight! i am in complete love with bh cosmetics and will continue to buy from them. thank you soooo much bh cosmetics ;) ;d ;) five star ratingivana scott, california 12345 bh home authenticity guarantee we guarantee the authenticity of all products purchased through bh cosmetics online. when purchasing your product at bh cosmetics you can expect the following: exclusive formulation and ingredients (beware of cheap imitations) high quality pigmentation of colors original design and packaging no animal testing all orders processed and shipped out in usa. products eyes 120 color palette 1st edition120 color palette 2nd edition120 color palette 3rd edition120 color palette 4th edition88 color cool matte palette88 color cool shimmer palette88 color tropical matte palette88 color tropical shimmer palette88 color matte palette88 color shimmer palette88 color neutral palette28 neutral color palette6 color eyeshadow pro15 color eyeshadow prosingle colorsgel eyelinerseye and lip primercorrecting eye primerwaterproof eye linerbh liquid eyelineroil free eye remover: xl size26 shadow blush combo palettefalse eyelashes false eyelashes "baby doll"false eyelashes "china doll"false eyelashes "foxy"false eyelashes "flirt"false eyelashes "natural"false eyelashes "sassy"false eyelashes "glam"false eyelashes "luxe"false eyelashes "flare"false eyelashes "singles medium"brushes all-over brushclassic smudge brushcontour blending brushprecision eyeliner brushfine eyeliner brushpowder brushhighlighter brushsmall, angled blush brushduo fiber stippling brushdeluxe foundation brushround stippling brushsmall concealer brushthe deluxe fan brushkabuki brush with pouchmini-kabuki brushsmudge brushsmall smudge brushangled shadow brushangled definer brushlip liner brushflat liner brushblending brush10 pcs deluxe brush set (red)10 pcs deluxe brush set (wood) site map summer specialsmakeup contestauthenticity guaranteevideo reviews & tutorialsreviewsyour reviewfaqcontactsour policyterms & conditions lips waterproof lip linereye and lip primer66 color lip palette32 color lip paletteface bronzing powdersfoundation primeranti-shine serumoil free eye remover: xl size26 shadow blush combo palette10 color concealer palette10 piece professional blush palettecontour & blush paletteaccesories mini brush beltpro artist brush beltzip-up tool and brush bagcosmetics bagpencil sharpenerbrush cleaner xl sizebh scentsbh carekittemporary body tattoos copyright © 2011, bhcosmetics.comall rights reserved. our policy terms & conditions site map
