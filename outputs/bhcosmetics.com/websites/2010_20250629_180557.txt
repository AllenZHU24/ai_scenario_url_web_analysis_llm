bh cosmetics, bhcosmetics - our privacy policies : make up palette : eye shadow palettes i ordered the holiday bundle of all three editions of the 120 color palettes, 66 color lipcolor palette, and the 10 brush set. not only did it come exactly on my birthday but it was very carefully wrapped and all the makeup was intact. the palettes were even better in person and the brushes were wonderful. i am working on getting the whole collection of bh products now. this is the best money ever spent for makeup. ladies stop lokking at the pictures over and over again and just order already, you'll be glad you did! five star ratinglaurissa grinston,united states,california bh cosmetic was recommended to me from a friend after i searched so many places for a low cost palette with a large asortment of colors. i had a hard time choosing which one 120 palette i wanted to buy first and i went with the 1st edition. i would definitely recommend this company to anyone. i intend to buy more products from bh cosmetics. so far i have both the 1st & 3rd edition 120 palettes, the cool matte and shimmer palette. my next purchase will most likely be the lip primer and the 66 lip color palette. thanks bh cosmetics!
