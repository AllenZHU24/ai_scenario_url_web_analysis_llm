bh cosmetics, bhcosmetics - faq bh customer service team is always here to help! call (888) 545 4744    or    send message 0 i got the 120 pallete 2nd edition because of the colors which i thought were very pretty!! i finally tried it and fell in love with such great product!! the price was also great!! very good makeup for very affordable pricing... this the beginning of something i've been looking for a long time!! <3 bh cosmetics!! five star ratingann ibanez, rhode island i am an aspiring makeup artist and attending makeup school with qc makeup academy. i have never heard of bh cosmetics and had only used mac cosmetics. i never thought anything could be as good as mac, but i was wrong. i recieved all of my makeup last week and the moment i put the makeup on from the primer, concealer foundation, blush, lip palette and eye shadow, i was like "wow". the makeup showed up so good without being caked on. even my husband was excited for me (because he knows my passion for makeup/makeup artistry). every day i have new people telling me how much they like my makeup. the most amazing thing to me is that i can have the makeup on for up to 12 hrs and the makeup has not smudged or moved and it looks like i just put it on. it always has that fresh look and feel. now i want to become a bh consultant and sell this makeup while being a free lance makeup artist. i am loving the products of bh cosmetics!!!!!! five star ratingpatricia mullins, virginia so impressed! pictures and price seemed too good to be true, but i looove these products! they came in under a week, even with the cheapest shipping option to canada, and i was a bit worried they'd be beaten up by the journey but they were perfectly packaged. the colours are fantastic, with sooo many options! i think my only problem is that i wasn't previously very big on doing my makeup but now with so many choices i just waste a lot of time playing around with them! five star ratingleah weston, canada, ontario 12345 bh home faq how long will it take to process my order?a: all orders placed on business days (monday-friday), before 3pm pst will be shipped on the same day. however, some orders may take up to 48 hours to process and ship depending on current promotions at that time. how do i track my order?a: tracking information will be automatically sent via email after your purchase has been processed. if you do not receive it and your order has been shipped, please check your spam folder. otherwise, please contact our support team for additional help. does bhcosmetics ship internationally? a: yes, we provide international shipping. you may purchase bhcosmetics products online using a major credit card or paypal account (to see more payment options please choose your country during the first step of the ordering process and your payment options will appear at your right). alternatively, you may mail in a cashiers check or money order in usd funds. once you place your order, it will be shipped within 24-48 business hours. our international shipping method is usps international. we ship most packages out of california so some areas will take longer to ship than others. you will be able to track your package via www.usps.com **more international shipping information: usps first class international [10-20 days] ($12.45) usps priority international [8-10 days] ($24.95) **shipping to canada: usps first class canada [10-15days] ($9.05) usps priority canada [8-10 days] ($16.95) usps canada standard [5-6 days] ($19.95) what are the differences between the 4 palettes in the 120 color palette collection?a: here are the differences: *the first edition has very bright, vibrant colors and carries very little neutral tones. *the second edition has bright and vibrant colors as well, but approximately twice as many neutral tones as the first edition. *the third edition has some bright colors, but is primarily neutral based and has a wide range of deep set tones perfect for an everyday look or night look. *the fourth edition is an all shimmer palette, with a mix of bright, neutral and dark shades. do the 120 color palettes and the 88 color palettes have the same colors?a: the shades may look similar, but each palette is unique to its own with slightly different shades from the rest of the palettes. what payment methods do you accept?a: o visa o mastercard o american express o paypal o prepaid company check, cashier check or money order (note: such orders will take 7-10 days to process as all checks must cleared, including cashier's check due to the existence of fraudulent checks.) can i order by mailing a cashiers check or money order?a: yes, you may download and print our mail order form. please click here to view this form. how secure is my online order?a: your online orders are secure. secure socket layer (ssl) encryption is used for every transaction to ensure that your order is secure. ssl encrypts the transmissions from our e-commerce servers as well as your computer. ssl encryption works by forming a matched pair with the transmission from your compute transmission and our server, so that only data to and from these sources can be valid. can i order over the phone?a: yes, you may call us toll free at 1-888-545-4744. we are open from 10am to 5pm pst, monday-friday. i am afraid the makeup palettes will break while in the mail. do you pack it well?a: absolutely. we use industrial materials to make sure that the probability of damage is minimal. we insure each package, so if anything happens to your purchase while in mail transit, we will be happy to switch your damaged item with a brand new one - free of charge. my package has missing products. what do i do?a: please contact our support team and we will confirm your order with the package contents. we apologize for any inconveniences!
