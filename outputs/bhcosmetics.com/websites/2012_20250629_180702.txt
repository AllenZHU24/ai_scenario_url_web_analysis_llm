wonderful quality at a wonderful price! i definitely recommend this palette!” – lacey from tennessee “i just received my package today and i can already tell i'm going to be using these products for a long time. the colors are extremely pigmented and the range of colors is overwhelmingly exciting. i purchased the 88 matte color palette, the 88 and 28 neutral color palette, false lashes in "china doll" and lip liner in coral. as i said, the colors are all very pigmented. the false lashes look legit and the lip liner is the perfect shade of coral. i am extremely impressed by bh cosmetics and i will definitely be shopping here again!!!” – rosiee from massachusetts “being a make-up artist, i've used many brands, and i can honestly say that bh cosmetics is some of the best i've ever tried. the lipliners are probably my favorite. they are in beautiful, soft colors, and don't fade or smudge! the eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, a little bit goes a long way and they last all day. they blend beautifully into your skin and only look better throughout the day. the neutral palette is amazing, the variety and softness of the shadows is a must-have, whether you're a professional or only an occasional make-up wearer. all the products are amazing, i can't wait to try them all!” – eliza from california products eye makeuplip makeupfalse eyelashesface makeupeye accessoriesmakeup brushesface accessorieslip accessoriesbrush setsbrush accessories site map bh gift cardsmakeup contestvideo reviews & tutorialsreviewsyour reviewfaqcontactswholesale payment copyright © 2012, bhcosmetics.comall rights reserved.our policyterms & conditionsauthenticity guaranteesite map
