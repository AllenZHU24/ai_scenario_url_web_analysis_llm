this is a problem! four star ratingjac toronto this little travel set is wonderful :) five star ratingfiercepinkcowgirl hankamer, tx after i ordered this, reading all the comments scared me because i thought it would be way too small.. i just got it in the mail and i was so shocked at how small the pink pouch was but once i opened it i was completelysatisfied with the size of the actual brushes. they are. it to small and they are perfect for anyone and everyday use five star ratingkarinatayylor miami fl. i love this crayons.. i got them when i purchased a palette and omg! what a big surprise, they stay all day long and the colors are just as you see them. five star ratingestela ii to i purchased this product not long ago and was delivered on time with the rest of my items.first impressions: the pencil is easy to handle, the product is long lasting and blends easily into the brow for great definition. the price is on par for a product like this.overall: i think this is a great start for brow pencils, however, my brows are a deep dark brown (almost black) and i find the color "brunette" far too light for me. i think looking over what's available, there needs to be a dark chestnut brown, for those of us with really dark brows.keep up the great work! four star ratingjenie montreal, qc love it love it five star ratingkitone12 rancho cucamonga, ca i really like this especially because i'm brown skin skin black woman so i bought the mocha. works perfect and looks perfect.i did have to buy there concealer because i have dark circles under my eye and it looks amazing together.oh! also i recieve this product in three days. five star ratingnecy p tampa, florida i really love this product. works well for any occasion apply just a little for a natural look or build it up for a full face. applys well very easy to blend in to the skin. lasted on my skin all day even on my nose even though i have a cold i was amazed. the only problem i could see was that it is slightly scented so if your face is super sensitive that could be problematic, even though it wasnt any issue for me. other than that i totally recommend it. four star ratingevie mt. airy nc good product overall satisfied, wasn't to happy with the color of my foundation ordered golden beige but wasn't what i saw online three star ratingtymetheinfamous tacoma wa i am a freelance mua so i purchased all 10 shades while they were on sell and i'm so glad i did. i finally got a chance to use them for the first time tonight and the result was a beautiful finish. when i swiped it on the face to color match the product had a built in shimmer which was very pretty and totally unexpected! this product has the finish of a mac stuido fix fluid. i rate this product an a+! the only thing i would recommend is that they start putting these products in plastic instead of glass. have to be extremely careful when handling! other than that two thumbs up!!! thanks bh cosmetics!!! five star ratingmrembolady chicago, il 12345 products eye makeuplip makeupfalse eyelashesface makeupeye accessoriesmakeup brushesface accessorieslip accessoriesbrush setsbrush accessories site map bh gift cardsmakeup contestvideo reviews & tutorialsreviewsyour reviewfaqcontactswholesale payment copyright © 2012, bhcosmetics.comall rights reserved.our policyterms & conditionsauthenticity guaranteesite map
