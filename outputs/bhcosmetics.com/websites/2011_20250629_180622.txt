i finally tried it and fell in love with such great product!! the price was also great!! very good makeup for very affordable pricing... this the beginning of something i've been looking for a long time!! <3 bh cosmetics!! five star ratingann ibanez, rhode islandi am an aspiring makeup artist and attending makeup school with qc makeup academy. i have never heard of bh cosmetics and had only used mac cosmetics. i never thought anything could be as good as mac, but i was wrong. i recieved all of my makeup last week and the moment i put the makeup on from the primer, concealer foundation, blush, lip palette and eye shadow, i was like "wow". the makeup showed up so good without being caked on. even my husband was excited for me (because he knows my passion for makeup/makeup artistry). every day i have new people telling me how much they like my makeup. the most amazing thing to me is that i can have the makeup on for up to 12 hrs and the makeup has not smudged or moved and it looks like i just put it on. it always has that fresh look and feel. five star ratingpatricia mullins, virginiaso impressed! pictures and price seemed too good to be true, but i looove these products! they came in under a week, even with the cheapest shipping option to canada, and i was a bit worried they'd be beaten up by the journey but they were perfectly packaged. the colours are fantastic, with sooo many options! i think my only problem is that i wasn't previously very big on doing my makeup but now with so many choices i just waste a lot of time playing around with them! five star ratingleah weston, canada, ontario page:12345 beauty tricks to make you look your prettiestdecember 28th,2011over time, certain beauty regimens and makeup tricks have proven to get the job done right, lucky magazine reports. time-tested beauty looks december 28th,2011beauty fads come and go, but it is the ones that continue to crop up that are worth paying particular attention to. peacock eyes pop up on the runwaysdecember 28th,2011fashion is constantly changing and part of the fun of the evolution is finding new and innovative ways to use cosmetics. according to the belfast telegraph, one of the most popular emerging trends on the runway this season is peacock eyes. page:12345 bh cosmetics makeup palettes offer the most brilliant colors available on the market. we use only the highest quality ingredients we guarantee you will enjoy using our full line of makeup palettes!
