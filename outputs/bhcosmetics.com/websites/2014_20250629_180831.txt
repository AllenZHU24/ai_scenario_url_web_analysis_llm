makeup brushes can develop a lot of dirt and bacteria, but regular care and cleansing of your makeup brushes can keep them and your face clean and healthy. keeping your brushes in good condition by washing them regularly will provide you with brushes that will last longer without the need to replace them.here are some tips on how to clean your makeup brushes.1. using the bh studio pro makeup brush cleaner, spray onto a tissue or directly onto the brush hairs and lightly stroke the brushes across the tissue. repeat by spraying the hairs again if necessary until there is no remaining color left on the tissue. make sure the brush hairs are always pointing downward - this will help prevent any liquid from getting into the ferrule (metal part) or down into the handle for brushes that don’t have ferrules. rinsing with water is not required. 2. after you have thoroughly cleansed your brush, gently brush them on a clean tissue or paper towel to remove any excess brush cleaner. lay them on a paper towel, tissue or regular towel to dry on their side. at this point, it’s a good idea to reshape the brush to prevent splaying. lay kabuki brushes and any other stand-up brush on their side. never let them dry with brush hairs up in a brush holder. the liquid can run down into the ferrule and over time will break down the glue holding the brush together.3. lastly, let brushes dry completely before using. dry time will vary, depending on size and brush density.individual brush collection overview review snapshot®by powerreviewsbhcosmeticsblending brush 4.8(based on 113 reviews)ratings distribution5 stars (92)4 stars (16)3 stars (5)2 stars (0)1 stars (0)97% of respondents would recommend this to a friend.proseasy to use (104)soft bristles (103)functional (92)great design (71)compact (36)conssheds (6)best useseveryday (100)going out (77)travel (59)reviewer profile:trendy style (41), natural style (37), classic style (28)write a reviewreviewed by 113 customerssort bynewestoldesthighest ratinglowest ratingmost helpfulleast helpfuldisplaying reviews 1-5back to topprevious | next »5/18/2012(26 of 27 customers found this review helpful) 5.0a blending wonder by neerajfrom mumbai, indiaabout me trendy styleprosdoes not shedeasy to usefunctionalgreat designsoft bristlesvalue for moneyconsbest useseverydaygoing outtravelcomments about bhcosmetics blending brush:this fluffy dome brush is not just value for money but also a great tool for professional makeup artists and amateurs alike. after washing, the brush becomes really fluffy and soft and blending dark shadows seamlessly.however i also recommend this brush for blending concealers, applying powders in hard to reach nooks and corners of the face and also to apply highlights and contour the bridge of the nose and all.its a perfect accessory and doesnt cause a dent on the pocket.recommended:jenni rivera 36 eyeshadow and blush palettebottom line yes, i would recommend this to a friend(26 of 27 customers found this review helpful)was this review helpful? yes / no - you may also flag this reviewcomment on this review4/22/2012(13 of 18 customers found this review helpful) 4.0pretty good brush by candymakeupchannelfrom marylandabout me trendy styleprosblends wellcomparable to elf studiolooks big but works greatsheds during washingsoftconsbest usescomments about bhcosmetics blending brush:the product wasn't decently packed so the brush hairs were tilted when i received it. shipping took a little long but after washing the brush and letting it dry, it worked great!
