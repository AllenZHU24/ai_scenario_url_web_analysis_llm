i heard about bh cosmetics through a friend who is a professional photographer, she sent me the link to this site & thats all it took! i really didnt know what to purchase so i bought the 120 first edition palette and fell in love with the vibrant colors! the pigment is great! bh cosmetics then had a sell so i purchased the 88 color matte palette and this one is my fav! it has every color you will ever need! great to create a simple & classic look, or a look for a night out on the town! i also purchased the 88 shimmer palette! which i pair with the 88 matte they go great together! thanks bh cosmetics your products are wonderful! look forward to purchasing some more very soon! oh, & i forgot to mention your deals are always amazingly great! five star ratingesperanza lopez, texas i got the 120 pallete 2nd edition because of the colors which i thought were very pretty!! i finally tried it and fell in love with such great product!! the price was also great!! very good makeup for very affordable pricing... this the beginning of something i've been looking for a long time!! <3 bh cosmetics!! five star ratingann ibanez, rhode island i am an aspiring makeup artist and attending makeup school with qc makeup academy. i have never heard of bh cosmetics and had only used mac cosmetics. i never thought anything could be as good as mac, but i was wrong. i recieved all of my makeup last week and the moment i put the makeup on from the primer, concealer foundation, blush, lip palette and eye shadow, i was like "wow". the makeup showed up so good without being caked on. even my husband was excited for me (because he knows my passion for makeup/makeup artistry). every day i have new people telling me how much they like my makeup. the most amazing thing to me is that i can have the makeup on for up to 12 hrs and the makeup has not smudged or moved and it looks like i just put it on. it always has that fresh look and feel. now i want to become a bh consultant and sell this makeup while being a free lance makeup artist. i am loving the products of bh cosmetics!!!!!!
