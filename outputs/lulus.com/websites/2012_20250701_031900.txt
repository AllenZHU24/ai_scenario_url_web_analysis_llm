xoxo comments (0)> diy: christmas chain bracelet general | 12 december 2012 by annie ‘tis the season for christmas-y crafting, so somewhere in-between stuffing stockings and hanging twinkle lights, why not make a cute little holiday treat for yourself (or friends!)? just dust off those skills from your elementary school days, and get into the spirit with this paper chain-inspired cutie! the things you’ll need: liquid stitch (or a similar permanent, clear drying adhesive) ribbon (as many or as few as you like!) fabric scissors optional: tweezers, cotton swabs, patience first things first: snip your ribbon into 1.5″-ish pieces. it’s helpful to do this ahead of time so you don’t lose track of the size. then: spread a little glue on the end of the ribbon (it helps to use a cotton swab for precision), then loop it into a little circle and press the ends together. it’s okay to get a little sloppy, the glue dries clear. voila! the chain begins… keep it up: loop another piece of ribbon through the circle you just made, then repeat the process above until your chain has reached the desired length. this is where a pair of tweezers comes in handy to swoop into those tiny spaces. that’s all folks: yep, it’s that easy! when you’re done, and your glue is dry, simply snip another small piece of ribbon and tie the ends together in a neat little knot (or a bow, if you want to get all fancy), and slip it onto your festive little wrist! comments (0)> good eats: chocolate dipped pretzel sticks general | 11 december 2012 by brittany cookies, cupcakes, brownies shaped like santa claus… sometimes holiday baking and creating goes over the top and takes all the fun out of an afternoon of treat-making. whether you’re an ace of cakes or a microwave maven, these no-fuss white chocolate dipped pretzel sticks are fun to make and even more fun to eat. here’s what you’ll need: - pretzel sticks or rods - white chocolate candy melts - decorative sprinkles, crushed candy canes or any other fun topping instructions: 1. follow the instructions on the back of the candy melts to easily melt them in the microwave 2. roll the melted candy or chocolate onto the pretzel with the back of a spoon 3. sprinkle your favorite topping onto the melted candy or chocolate while it’s still sticky 4. let them dry for about an hour, serve and enjoy! comments (0)> five favorite holiday flicks! general | 11 december 2012 by brittani it’s a cold winter night and you find yourself all cozied up to a fire, with a mug of hot chocolate, ready to relax. you reach for the remote, but suddenly- your big brother puts on football, your grandpa starts snoring like a freight train, and your parents have had a little too much wine and are stumbling down memory lane (dad used to be in an 80′s hair band, what?)! the holidays typically mean you’re surrounded by family. and if your family is anything like mine, we tend to drive each other a liiiittle nuts during the holidays. there’s only one solution to the madness: corralling everyone into one room, popping in a good movie, and letting laughter commence! everyone has their favorites, but here are my top five fun flicks to help keep your family sane during the holidays! a christmas story -”fra-gee-lay!” how many times have you wanted to quadruple dog dare your friends to try and lick a frozen pole? or have you ever wished your dad would just take that darn leg lamp out of the front window? don’t you wish your bright pink bunny footie pajamas were socially acceptable? this movie is perfect for you. trust me. christmas vacation – “little full, lotta sap.” the griswold’s could make any family look like the von trapp’s. this movie has all the basics: christmas tree catching on fire, woman getting attacked by squirrel, and chevy chase. if those aren’t reasons enough to love this hilarious holiday flick, i just don’t know what is! love actually – “let’s go get the s*** kicked out of us by love!” there’s just something about the holidays that puts me in the mood for love. maybe it’s the mistletoe, maybe it’s the showering of gifts. either way, i’m a sucker for an uber romantic holiday movie! who wouldn’t want the one and only andrew lincoln (walking dead, anyone?) to show up at their door with cue cards confessing his love? it’s almost too romantic to handle! almost. home alone – “kevinnnnn!” little kevin mccallister is pretty much a parent’s worst nightmare. he’s a smart-mouthed trouble-maker, but gosh is he cute! so cute his parents forget about him, leave for a trip to paris, and then utter mayhem ensues! if you don’t already know about the after-shave/face slap/macauley culkin scream scene, well, now’s your chance! elf – “i just love to smile, smiling’s my favorite!” cliche as it may be, elf is too stinkin’ adorable and heartwarming to not be a favorite! will ferrell and zooey deschanel are perfect, and this is definitely a movie to help restore your holiday spirit! don’t believe me? try making it through the first ten minutes without cracking so much as a smile – i dare ya! “bye buddyyyy!” totes. adorbs. now it’s time to sit back, relax, and enjoy some holiday movies! have fun, snow angels! xoxo (images courtesy of thereelbits.com, fanpop.com, houseofgeekery.com, and mymodernmet.com) comments (0)> chictopia style contest contests | 11 december 2012 by lulu*s naughty or nice?
