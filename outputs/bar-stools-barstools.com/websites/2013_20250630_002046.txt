entrapment or falls: never allow a child under 6 years old on the upper bunk. use only a mattress which is 74" -75" long and 37-1/2" - 38-1/2" wide on the upper bunk. ensure thickness of mattress and foundation combined does not exceed 8" and surface of mattress is at least 5" below upper edge of guardrails. always use guardrails on both long sides of the upper bunk. if bunk bed will be placed next to a wall, the guardrail that runs the full length of the bed should be placed against the wall to prevent entrapment between the bed and the wall. prohibit horseplay on or under bed(s) and prohibit jumping on the bed. prohibit more than one person on upper bunk. use ladder for entering and leaving upper bunk. maximum total weight is not to exceed 300lbs. on the upper bunk. periodically check and ensure that the guardrail, ladder, and other components are in their proper position, free from damage, and that all connectors are tight. do not use substitute parts. replacement parts, including additional guardrails, may be obtained from our customer service department. use of water or sleep flotation mattresses is prohibited. use of a night light may provide added safety precaution for a child using the upper bunk. strangulation hazard - never attach or hang items to any part of the bunk bed that are not designed for use with the bed, for example, but not limited to, hooks, belts and jump ropes. hammocks warnings - strangulation & falling hazard. injury can result when getting onto or off of a hammock, which can be unstable. please exercise caution. never leave children unsupervised with hammocks since they could become entangled in hammock strings. self-assembled products always follow the exact instructions provided by manufacturers when assembling their products. most manufacturers offer additional phone support if you are need assistance in assembly. product assembly instructions are the responsibility of the maker of that product. both the process of assembly and failure to properly assemble a product can result in serious injury. bicycle safety bicycle safety is of the utmost importance to our cycle vendors, and it should be to you too. that is why we have included the following tips for keeping yourself safe while you ride. wear a helmet. it is strongly advised that a properly fitting bicycle safety helmet be worn at all times when riding your bicycle. obey traffic laws. bicycles are considered a vehicle, so while riding you follow the same laws as you would in a car, including yielding to pedestrians and stopping at red lights and stop signs. ride predictably. while riding, you should not do anything that would surprise or confuse drivers. you should ride in a straight line and with traffic. use hand signal. using proper hand signals when riding your bicycle will help drivers know what to expect. you signal that you wish to make a left turn by hold your left arm straight out. to indicate that you will be making a right turn, hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing up, and your palm facing forward. for signaling coming to a stop hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing down, and your palm facing rearward. keep your distance. whether you are riding on busy street or on secluded bicycle trail, it is always a good decision to keep your distance from cars, pedestrians, and other riders. disclaimer neither ivgstores, llc nor this website are responsible for injuries resulting from use of products offered on and/or purchased from this
