frequently asked bar stools questions frequently asked questions q. are swivel bar stools available in both wood as well as the retro or metal styles? a. yes. click on the "categories" section on the left to view our many swivel choices. q. can i get chrome bar stools in something other than the "retro" look? a. yes. click on the "categories" section on the left to view our many chrome choices. q. what is the difference between "counter stools" and a "bar stools?" a. a counter stool is 24 inches to 26 inches high from the top of its seat to the floor and are ideal for typical (but not all) kitchen counters - that are 36 inches from their top to the floor. many counters are 40 inches or 42 inches off the floor - which is the same as commercial bar heights. for these you need standard 30 inch high bar stools. q. i have an old set of 24-inch high (seat height) bar stools that always make me feel like i am sitting underneath my pass-through kitchen counter top. a. your “kitchen counter” height is over the “usual” 36’ to 39” – and the spread between your counter top and your bar stool top is well over the recommended 11 (or so) inches. that’s how i got into this business! i had these 24” seat height bar stools – and my kitchen counter top was 41˝ inches from the floor. i had a 17˝ inch gap between the top of the seat and the top of the counter – so i never used my great counter top for those its intended purpose – until i finally got the right bar stools (30 inchers). the moral of the story – a lot of kitchen counter tops are more like bar counter tops – so assume nothing – & measure everything. q. do i need special service for unloading my delivery to my residence if my order requires a common carrier (truck service) rather than ups ground or fedex ground? a. not usually, but that is up to you. bar stools and matching chairs are packed at a maximum packed weight of around 35 pounds. tables with glass are heavier. if we determine that the $75 fee for “unload” or “liftgate” services will apply, we would speak with you before your order is finally processed. q. can i rely on the colors and textures and stains i see on these pages? a. we spent many long hours trying to accurately photograph and properly replicate the fabric and finish images on our site. at the end on the day, they are still not true to life – and there are differences in computers and monitors and printers. the only sure way to confirm a color or texture or stain – is to look at it directly. having said that, there are very few requests for returns at all – and even less because of dissatisfaction with the color or texture. we will be happy to send out color, wood and even metal samplers if you need to see them first. more faqs....
