same laws as you would in a car, including yielding to pedestrians and stopping at red lights and stop signs. ride predictably. while riding, you should not do anything that would surprise or confuse drivers. you should ride in a straight line and with traffic. use hand signal. using proper hand signals when riding your bicycle will help drivers know what to expect. you signal that you wish to make a left turn by hold your left arm straight out. to indicate that you will be making a right turn, hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing up, and your palm facing forward. for signaling coming to a stop hold your left arm out with your elbow bent 90 degrees, your hand pointing down, and your palm facing rearward. keep your distance. whether you are
