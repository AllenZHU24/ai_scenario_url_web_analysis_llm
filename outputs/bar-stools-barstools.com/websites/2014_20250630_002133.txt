items that are small and light enough to ship with small parcel carriers are shipped either by fedex or ups. larger items are shipped via truck. transit times for small parcel shipments vary nationwide from 1-5 days. a signature is not required for small parcel items (unless delivering to a business location). the driver will ring your door bell and if there is no one home the package will be left in a safe, dry area. if the driver determines there is no safe location to leave the parcel they will leave a note giving you instructions on how to obtain your parcel. larger items are shipped via truck and transit times vary from 3-10 days. items shipped on trucks will be delivered to the curbside only. the customer is responsible for bringing the items inside their home or garage. the trucking company will deliver during normal business hours, monday through friday. they will call to schedule an appointment and usually offer a 4 hour window. customers requiring assistance to bring merchandise into their homes have the option to upgrade to a deluxe inside delivery (see upgrades below). ivgstores offers upgraded shipping if you require special services or have limited access you may upgrade your shipment to a deluxe inside or deluxe inside with set up delivery. these options are available at time of check out. transit time for white glove delivery is typically 1-3 weeks. deluxe inside (additional fee) this is a two person delivery inside the first dry area of your home or garage. this service includes stair carries (up to 2 flights of stairs) before the threshold and is ideally suited to customers living in apartments with exterior staircases without elevators. deluxe inside with set up (additional fee) offering a two person delivery similar to the deluxe inside delivery but also including placement in your room of choice, inside stair carries (2 flights), unpack and debris removal and 15 minutes light set up/assembly without tools. free shipping we offer free shipping on many of our products. this option will be listed on the product page. with free shipping, we have added actual ship costs into the total price we offer. shipping upgrade charges still apply. where we deliver we deliver to the continental united states. we do not ship to alaska, hawaii, puerto rico, canada or the virgin islands at this time. we are currently unable to deliver to po or apo/fpo boxes, except for rural po addresses. if you require overseas shipping please use your freight forwarders address as the ship to address. multiple shipping addresses for multiple shipping addresses, simply place a separate order for each address. when should i receive my order?
