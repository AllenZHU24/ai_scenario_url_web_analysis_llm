occasionally an item is oversold in our warehouse, especially items on clearance that are low on stock. when an item is low on stock and more customers place orders for what we have available it has been oversold and we cannot send it to everyone who has ordered it. our inventory is updated frequently, but occasionally this will happen and we are sorry for any disappointment caused as a result. it is not likely we will receive more of the item and you will be refunded for the item not shipped, with notice given via a credit memo indicating a refund has been processed for the item and your bank has been notified of this. we do not back order items so we cannot send it to you at a later date. should the item become available again you will need to place a new order. it is possible the oversold item is still showing as available on the website. if you see this, please send us an email so that we will be able to look in to the item and confirm whether or not it is out of stock. unfortunately we are not able to substitute for items that we are not able to fulfill on your order. payment what forms of payment do you accept?
