the design and detail is so feminine and pretty and the killer part is that it is actually made for a woman with curves, which is very hard to find. customer service was very polite and knowledgeable, and my overall experience was a 10!

i am also impressed with the variety of styles and products that you offer. i have not found any competitor that has as much variety with your level of quality in my sizes. you have found a loyal customer in me and i plan to order all my lingerie from you in the future. thank you for opening such a wonderful web site! andrea m., canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ hello, thank you! i just wanted to let you know how impressed i was with hips and curves. i had some items that were on back order and someone actually called and helped me substitute items. i thought that was very nice and incredible customer service!!!!

i am going to order more items from you right away. thanks for the great service! nicole l., vancouver, bc ~~~~~~~~~~~ just a note of personal thanks - i have adored the chance to look gorgeous and sexy and luscious in all the things i've ordered from h&c.  and, i get to show them off to a new "friend" - a marine returning from service of our country in iraq.  i've taunted and teased, with all the things i've now stockpiled. so thank you for the wonderful products and for the boost of self confidence i've gotten.  i turned 50 last year, but i feel like a youngster again. you guys are the bestest ever! jewel k., denver, co ~~~~~~~~~~~ excellent service i just wanted to write say what excellent service i recently received from your returns department. i have never tried to return anything before; i was worried that i would be hassled. i couldn't have been more wrong! i received nothing but prompt, helpful, and polite service from the moment i called. i was never kept waiting on hold for more than 30 seconds. everyone was so kind and helpful, especially my customer service representative, cathy. when i asked for a new item rather than a refund, she even called me at home to let me know that, while they were out of my size in black, there were plenty of other options for me. i will definitely continue to order from hips & curves. thank you very much! thank you jaime m., washington, d.c. ~~~~~~~~~~~ you are the best! i just wanted to let you folks know that before i ordered from hips & curves, i had the worst time ordering lingerie online - two companies in particular never even let me know my order was delayed or wasn't being shipped after all. they just charged my credit card and left me waiting for weeks without a confirmation, ship date or order update. hips & curves, on the otherhand, had a great website, easy order lookup and prompt shipping. i received my item within a few days and with zero hassle, it was great!! thanks so much! veronica a., portland, or ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear h&c, i bought a corset to go underneath my wedding dress and i am so happy with the corset that i got from you! it is beautiful and i love that it is made for a larger girl like me! i have searched for reasonable prices in the proper sizes all over and love that you have a store devoted for us big beautiful women! it is nice to look at ads and not have to see a stick thin woman wearing a piece that is being sold at plus size. we can actually see what your products look like on women like us. it is so liberating! your products are made of such great materials and are such a treat! keep up the great work shannon las vegas, nv ~~~~~~~~~~~ hey! i wanted to express my appreciation to your lingerie consultants once again. i placed an order a few minutes ago and didn't realize the total was a little off until after i hung up. i called back again and got everything straightened out with no fuss whatsoever. not only has everyone been very friendly and helpful but you also have the best prices on the crown-ette shaper panty (item # sc1311) that i can find online. believe me i checked. when my houseguest commented on my "nice butt" she didn't know i was wearing this particular panty at the time. i knew i'd be back for more. thankx again r.h. in south carolina ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just received 4 items that i purchased last week for the first time. i am very pleased and i feel your products are top notch and your customer service is excellent thank you beth g baltimore, md ~~~~~~~~~~~ my new boyfriend turned me on to this site over a month ago and i must admit i was a little hesitant about ordering something. i had never seen such items in my size. well, i received my lace body stocking today and i am very very pleased! the quality and the fit are on point! we will see each other in august and i will be surprising him with a few of your items. i will definitely recommend the site as well. happy and hot in dallas yevette m.- dallas texas ~~~~~~~~~~~ hiya. just got my new bra today, and it is fabulous!

(i even had time to fit in one extra order before the wedding! :-) thanks guys, for breaking the mould and recognising that people over a size 14 are human too! kate e, from busselton, western australia ~~~~~~~~~~~ wow! i just received my first order from hips & curves. thank you for providing merchandise of this quality that actually fits!! i am thrilled and, more importantly, i'm sure my very special someone will be too. i'm already planning for the great 'reveal' while on vacation next week. h & c and i will have a long relationship into the future...it has been a pleasure dealing with your company. paula fm. grosse pointe, michigan ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear h&c, recently made my first purchase from your company as birthday gifts for my notoriously hard to shop for girlfriend. a previous attempt to buy lacy nothings for her had ended in disaster when i couldn't figure out what size to get. not so on your fine site. everything was carefully annotated as to size and the choices were all gorgeous. placed my order, went for express shipping as i'd left it a mite late to shop, and got an email notice that two of my items were on backorder. fearing another disaster, i called customer service where a very helpful and friendly young lady had me sorted out with replacements in no time at all. order even shipped on time. items were in excellent condition and most importantly - my girlfriend was over the moon. and having seen her in the lace garters and thigh highs, she ain't the only one! ^_~ thanks so much for making my number one lady's birthday a smash. al b. ! albany, ga ~~~~~~~~~~~ weee! a place for me! you have to smile when you come to this site - all the women are glowing, strutting there stuff here where it counts. i wanna be a hips & curve model too. oh my goodness yes! yes! yes! loving it. i love hips & curves! this place is what's happening for big bold beautiful ladies. mmmm! u better ask somebody. i've finally found a place for me! so cool, you have no clue how deep that is for me. child i been to all kinds of stores looking for just the right size bra, night gown, and anything in between. always trying to fit in, and be accepted. i don't have to worry about nobody turning their nose up when i come through the door because i got it going on girl, and my smile is infectious :) you must smile back baby it's the real deal. thank you. muah! alvee ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am writing this letter to inform hips & curves that i received my order today. i wanted you to know how very pleased i am with my purchase. pictures really don't do what the outfits do too you when you see them with your naked eye. thank you for spice i've been looking for! p.s. i can't wait for my next order... angela b. ~~~~~~~~~~~ hips & curves deserves to be applauded for their excellent customer service. we economy sized ladies living in the remote regions really appreciate the value we get when shopping through your online catalogue. (p.s. the stores locally consider a 36b to be a plus size???) the order was received today in nanaimo, bc , canada and all the items are fantastic. thank you for the great customer service. i certainly will be ordering from hips & curves in the future edna stefishen ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am so pleased for my order to hips & curves. i received it yesterday and everything is great! you now have a very happy customer in greece! my husband is also very happy! thanks! katerina l, greece ~~~~~~~~~~~ i would just like to say, thank you so much! i've been attracted to my fiance since the first day we met, but the hardest thing to do was to get her to feel sexy. after looking around for a bit, i found your site, and found the perfect teddy for her. i ordered it, and after we got it she was hesitant to wear it at first, but i convinced her to go and try it on. she came back wearing it and, to be honest, i couldn't even speak when i saw her. all i could do was sit there and stare at her. afterwards, when we were talking, she admitted to me that she felt very sexy wearing that teddy. i would have gladly paid twice as much as i did to get her to say that. reuben faux ~~~~~~~~~~~ oh my goodness, you guys ship fast! i got that red velvet corset yesterday. it fits me and it looks so pretty. thank you so much. =] i can't believe it was on sale for that price either, it was great! thank you so much! suzanne b. moses lake, washington ~~~~~~~~~~~ just wanted to say i love hips and curves, i have been searching for some sexy lingerie for big beautiful women who want to feel sexy also. your site has certainly made that possible. thank you! i received the lace baby doll and charmeuse robe today and tried it on for the hubby and he started drooling and most definitely approved. he loved the way the set looked so much that he asked if he wanted to take pictures. the fit of your products are amazing and they make me feel and look so sexy and beautiful. the two outfits that i have ordered thus far were amazing, thanks for the wonderful prices and the quick delivery, can't wait to order more. i love hips and curves! jackie b., clarkesville, tn ~~~~~~~~~~~ i opened my latest order from you last night and was very pleased. i ordered the kiss & tulle bra and matching panty in chocolate, and l love the color. when i placed my order i was a little worried because right afterward, the web site said there were no panties in chocolate. i called customer service and was assured that i did get the matching panties, and probably had gotten the last pair. i wish i could remember the name of the woman i spoke with, she was lovely, polite, and made sure that i was reassured about my order being correct. this is the third order i've placed with your company, and i am sure i will be ordering more from you in the future. it was refreshing to find lingerie for a size above 4 that is pretty, comfortable to wear, sexy, and classy. thank you, jessica h., martinez, ca. ~~~~~~~~~~~ just wanted to say thanks for your company. i ordered a beautiful piece and got it today and i will be ordering more soon!

thank you so much. for big women it is so hard to find lingerie that fits and looks good at the same time. many kudos to your company! nan l, cameron, tx ~~~~~~~~~~~ you rock. your order processing and delivery is unbeatable, your selection exciting and your product is fantastic. i feel sorry for your competition, gratitude for your existence and immense pleasure at the look on my husbands face when i enter the room in one of your sassy outfits! keep curvy! suzanne, slave lake ab ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just found your website while shopping for a bridal shower and i love it!!!! thanks for choosing women who look real in the clothes instead of fake poses. it really gives the buyer the chance to see how it will look. the choice in australia is so limited,and the prices on what is available are exorbitant for the quality we get here. i was hesitant at first about measuring up for proper bra sizing and ordering online. imagine my elation when i pulled the bras out of the packet! i am a 42c/d depending. for the first time in i can't tell you,i felt so comfortable! the 2 styles fit so beautifully. i am a larger lady who struggles to find good foundation garments and stockings in plus sizes. the shapewear is something i want more of! i have to say that even my husband commented on my new things.i don't think he understood how a great bra can make a gal so happy! ha! needless to say my visa card will be getting a big future workout with hips and curves! i also just have to say that i have been raving to everyone who will listen about hips and curves! don't be surprised if all of a sudden, sydney sales go through the roof, as i know lots of larger ladies who are just waiting to find you guys! just by the by, i have had a few comments about my 'new' bust line from ladies i know and see often. amazing what a well fitting bra makes. hooray for 3 hooks!!! ha! thanks a million, yet again! i am one very happy customer! cheers! lydia k. sydney, australia ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just found your website while shopping for a bridal shower and i love it!!!! thanks for choosing women who look real in the clothes instead of fake poses. it really gives the buyer the chance to see how it will look. mary m. peoria, il ~~~~~~~~~~~ you guys rock! the service is so good! i wish everyone i dealt with could be so good! have a great day! thank you! dorothy h ~~~~~~~~~~~ hey! i just wanted to thank you so much for encouraging plus-sized women all over the world! this site shows you can be sexy and daring, while still having the fit and comfort that us plus-sized ladies need! the glamazons are awesome role-models for plus-sized women out there, they show us how to be confident and flaunt what you got! plus-sized women aren't observed in the media as much for being "sexy" or "hot" and i believe that you guys are contributing to a change that should be happening! enough being scarily skinny and unhealthy, it's time to embrace who we are as women, and show off those curves! thank you so much for creating this site, it has given me more confidence in myself and allows me to be who i want to be: sexy and fun! elisha k., calgary, ab, canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ soooooo impressed with my first experience ordering from your company. the product was shipped and received very promptly!!!! and the products were exactly as i expected. i will definitely be ordering from you again and again!!! michelle h. brandon, manitoba, canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ yay! thank you so much for working with me, no website has ever contacted me like you have and seemed to really care. i am beyond impressed and so pleased with everything that has transpired between us. hipsandcurves.com makes shoping online easy and worry free. thank you so much tina, you are a sweetheart. lorie c, indianapolis, in ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to say thank you so much!!!! i am not a size 1, so i can not shop in victoria secret, so i have searched the internet for some great wedding "attire" and found you guys and i have to tell you....i almost cried when i saw your truly plus size models on there wearing stuff that society tells us "thick" girls we can't wear. i mean seriously i have tears in my eyes because yall make it "ok" to be big and yall make your sizes over a 5! i love you guys and i am going to tell everyone about you! trust me! there are some thick women here in oklahoma ! ;) thank you!!!!! kasey m., tulsa, ok ~~~~~~~~~~~ i ordered the goddess serena bustier a few months ago to wear under my wedding dress. finding a strapless bra that wasn't useless to an h- cup lady like myself was a daunting task, but this garment tucked, lifted, emphasized, and fit like a charm for the entire 12-hour day. being a new fan of goddess, i ordered the longline bra (in a ff cup, but it still fits awesome) and it just came through the door about 10 minutes ago. holy crap! i could have breasts the weight of bowling balls and this bra would still make them look perky! and even with shipping and duty, i paid a fraction of what it would cost in a specialty lingerie store. i'll be wearing tube and halter tops for the first time ever this summer, and i have you guys (and goddess) to thank! i'd recommend these two bras to anyone needing something strapless. crystal ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am just so grateful for this website. just when i almost lost all hope for classy and tasteful and beautiful lingerie. just want to send my thanks. t.b. ~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to compliment everyone involved in the production of your website! it is wonderful to see a plus sized site that actually uses plus sized models to model their clothing (not to mention finding a site that carries such lovely items in larger sizes)! very refreshing to see. thank you! paula cohen ~~~~~~~~~~~ i was wondering if you guys have a place on your website for comments? you have done a great job. i already recieved my mail today and i just got an email yesterday saying that it was shipped! i can't beleive how fast it arrived, and how much i love what i ordered. i just wanted to let everybody on there know what a great job and reasonably priced you guys are! keep up the great work!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~ thank you so very much, your service is absolutely brilliant and your products are fantastic. i placed my order via your web site on the 22/2 and it was delivered to my home in australia on 27/2. it took 5 days for my order to be processed, packaged and delivered half way across the world. i don't get that service in my own state. congratulations, i shall be recommending you to all my friends and collegues. many many thanks. lyn ~~~~~~~~~~~ to the staff at hips and curves, thank you so much for having a place where i can finally shop for lingerie! i received the items today and just tried them on, and my boyfriend loves the way they look on me. thanks again! irene ~~~~~~~~~~~ hi! i just wanted to let you know..i got my order today. it got here so fast! and ohhh my goodness, it's so beautiful...all of it! i can't tell you how many times i've been disappointed with stuff that didn't fit, or didn't look right, or something, but this really does, and i feel so beautiful wearing it! i will definitely look no further when i want to buy my lingerie..thank you so much ~~~~~~~~~~~ your customer service has been very prompt. i can't believe how quickly you got my order processed and to me. i order online and by catalog a lot and great customer service is rare, so thank you so much. ~~~~~~~~~~~ i was amazed to receive my order from you within 24 hours! the quality of each garment is spectacular, and the sizes are just right. top notch company -- i will definitely be a repeat customer! thank you so much, r. w. in ks ~~~~~~~~~~~ hello! i'd just like to say that my husband bought me some very pretty lingerie from your site for christmas, and i absolutely love it! (as does he!) its been hard for me over the last several years to come to terms with my curvier20-something figure. (i spent my childhood and teen years as a tall, thin girl.) however, with sites like yours which offers great clothing for curvy women like me, i realize now that no matter what size you are, you can be beautiful both inside and out! thank you for the beautiful things on your site, and for giving women like me a chance to show the confidence and style we want and need! i'll definitely be a return shopper! sincerely, casandra g ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to let you know way to go and now i know where i am going to get all of my fun apparel from in the future. i also want to thank you for making us "extra lovable" women feel sexy when we fight so hard in the everyday world against discrimination. when i first got with my fiance i thought he just dealt with the extra weight; he couldn't possibly be attractive to those rolls of flesh. now i know there are men that are driven crazy and find it irresistible. but i was always looking for lingerie that turned me own as well as him. as i was looking through your website i was in awe to how beautiful it made me feel and what a sigh of relief it was to find so many choices for those nights that are about discovering me seductively. i look forward to many orders with your company. again thank you!!!! jennifer flowers ~~~~~~~~~~~ i called when i was getting ready to order my corset for my honeymoon. i don't remember whom it was that i spoke with but, i'm so very glad that i called, i followed your instructions about measuring. i was going to buy the light blue and white in a 42 but, you were out, so i called and the wonderful and helpful customer service rep., talked to me and she told me that since i am a ddd instead of a dd that i should go up to the 44 and assured that it would work. i am so very glad that i listened to her she was 100% right and if the 42 hadn't been out of stock i would have gotten that and had to return it most likely. thanks to your customer support staff for being there. jeannine i. riley ~~~~~~~~~~~ i had the best shopping experience with the rep that helped me!! i really wanted to make sure she knew how much she helped me make the proper choices for my bust size!! please tell her i appreciated all her help!! errorka russell ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to let you know that we received the order, it was well worth the wait. you have such wonderful items that you sell. i can't wait to do some more shopping with you. you have such amazingly gorgeous models as well on your web site. keep up the great work!!! tr ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear hips & curves.com, my name is christina. i ordered item number x9001 in the baby blue color fed ex 2 day delivery. this is an email to express my extreme satisfaction with hips & curves.com. please feel free to publish this email as well as my photos. my husband and i were celebrating our 1 year anniversary at a very romantic resort. i wanted to really treat my husband and look sexy and classy for this special event. i ordered the baby blue corset in a size 46...i also purchased a pair of white stiletto sandals to go with the white trim along the corset. my husband adored me when i walked out of the dressing room at our suite. his jaw dropped and his eyes lit up like fire. not only is blue his favorite color, but i had relaxed my hair so it was long and flowing. i'd also purchased item number x8997 of which he adored also...in blue of course. i am just writing to say that i love the fact the hips & curves had lingerie for the plus sized woman with hips and curves! thank you so much for making my anniversary getaway with my husband, one that he and i will never forget. thanks again! christina ~~~~~~~~~~~ oh my god! thank you so so so so much. my boyfriend and i have been wanting to buy some sexy night time play clothes and have had some hard times finding things i like in the right sizes. then one day we were talking and i ran across your site in a search page. we were sooooooo excited. finally we found something we can both agree on and love! we have not yet placed an order but do plan to order most definetely. he is a truck driver so our time together is limited to 4 or 5 days a month and this site is really really going to be a pick me up for our "recreational" time. i am so so so please with everything and the sizes are great. thank you so much!!!! a note from him: you guys are a real life saver you've made us both extremely happy and not to mention my holiday shopping much easier. that's funny because i know i will be purchasing new stuff at least monthly!!!!! thank you thank you thank you thank you so much for making my baby feel like the goddess she is! two happy ecstatic lovers! ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to let you know that while my husband has been out of town (for 2 months!!) i'd been thinking about getting something sexy to surprise him with when he gets home. so i ordered a leather corset and thigh high stockings. i just got them in the mail yesterday and had to hurry to try them on because i was so excited!!! they fit awesome and look even better!!! i sent him a little sample on his cellphone and he was very impressed. said he couldn't wait till he came home and got to see me in my new outfit. i just wanted to thank everyone at hips and curves for providing all of us "curvy" women with a place to find great fitting lingere, at a great cost. it just makes me feel so sexy and it makes me really appreciate what i've got! my husband is going to start drooling when he sees me! so thanks in advance from a very happy customer! mr. and mrs. m ~~~~~~~~~~~ i love your website, i love to shop and i get so frustrated trying to find sexy clothes to wear for my boyfriend. why do people think just because you are fat you have no right to be sexy. the industry tries to make young beautiful women wear their grandmothers clothes. and the best part is everything is affordable. i dont have to work a second job. thank you! km ~~~~~~~~~~~ i ended up on your site from a prompt on aol's welcome screen. i thought i had seen every tired site claiming to be "lingerie" for plus sized woman and then i found hips & curves and my view on lingerie for plus sized woman has changed!!! for the better! not only is the selection very extensive, but its all very tastefully done and the cuts and designs seem to be flattering. its hard finding something that looks good on you and the hanger. im overly excited at the choices. not only do you offer so much, but your site provides a shopping experience for those who are into aesthetics as well. a lot of sites for plus sized lingerie look as though they were put together by a team of barely computer literate third graders. im so glad i found you! this is going to be the beginning of a lovely relationship... pardon me, but i have to go shopping now :-) pbg ~~~~~~~~~~~ i absolutely love your website. it is everything it should be...so classy & completely user friendly. i am so glad i found you guys. your products are beautiful, stunning and of course, sexy. i will always be a hips and curves woman...keep up the tremendous work!!! st ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just thought i would share my comments with you. i just received my order and i am thrilled! i was surprised to see that delta burke's name was on the label! i originally bought it as a gift for my husband for valentine's day but i think that he'll be getting it early this year!!!! thank you for a wonderful product! i have already recommended your company to several of my friends and i will definitely be a repeat buyer! n from new york ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear all of the wonderful staff at hips & curves, i am one of those women that is not technically plus size and not technically traditional size. fitting sexy clothes for me is quite discouraging. when i stumbled across your web site i was thrilled and told all of my friends who have since placed and received their orders. when i received my order i could not wait until i got home to try it on. i ordered a corset and had it on in the middle of my office asking my assistant how it looked. her words were encouraging, but when my husband saw me for the first time dressed for the halloween party that we were attending i wanted to cry. it was the first time in years that the sight of me took his breath away. by the way i won the contest...go figure against all these little tiny women that looked amazing. i have never felt this sexy... i will continue to purchase products from your sight. the only thing that would be better for me and i am sure many others would be to have a store near where we live or at least the nearest metropolitan area to shop for and have immediate gratification.... i love to shop, but when things to fit right i get discouraged.... i guess i will have to keep an eye out for your stores in the malls near me, one day i am sure that you will be there and i can not wait. thanks again for making me realize that women are not perfect in size but in sexiness and heart. j.p. ~~~~~~~~~~~ thank you so much for this awesome newsletter. it's about time us full figured women are recognized for being sexy an beautiful. your newsletter is so uplifting and much needed. i just can't say enough about it. i found a place i can call home. much love, gloria ~~~~~~~~~~~ i really can't tell you how glad i am that i found your website. i'm one of those "plus size" women that hears, on a regular basis, "you have a beautiful face, " "you have a beutiful smile," "you have beautiful eyes," etc. every compliment is for something above the neck. i'm not viewed as sexy because of my size 18 - 20 body. the owner of the bar i go to here, in syracuse, has given me an opportunity to guest bartend on november 16. i've never bartended a day in my life, but i'm a regular at this bar because i used to go there frequently for karaoke (before i became a vocalist for a local band). being a big fan of coyote ugly and having watched that competition on cmt, i used to think i'd be a great contender for something like that in spite of my size. i have the attitude, i have the talent, i have the brains, i have the ability to control a crowd and from the neck up i seem to have the looks. this guest bartending thing is my one shining moment to prove that i can be sexy and desireable too. with the help of the bustier i ordered from your website, i don't think anyone will be laughing at the plus sized girl in the bustier behind the bar that night. i had my doubts until i tried it on. no one will be laughing at me. while i appreciate the compliments that people give me, it's going to feel so good to not be the girl with the beautiful face for a night. thank you...thank you....thank you. rebecca roach ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear hips and curves, my order just came in and is now waiting for my wife to return from work. i would like to say that your online cataloge does an impressive job at getting sizes correct. it's so nice that i am able to buy something soft and luxurious for my wife without having to worry if it will fit or not. i'm also a six foot three man so i tend to stand out in lingerie stores which can be a daunting task sometimes. my wife is the most precious gift that i have been given in life and now through your web site i can show her what she means to me. i also love the little bit of mystery and romance that ordering from your online site allows. in conclusion, thank you for all that you do and i'm sure that this will be the first of many of my orders. thank you, wes farris ~~~~~~~~~~~ thank you!! thank you!! thank you!! i received all the items a few days ago. i just tried on the "thumper" costume and i look fabulous!! it fits fantastically, which is very seldom when buying online plus size apparel. your sizing chart was so helpful and accurately depicts the size of the clothing. the quality of the clothing is exceptional as well. thank you hips and curves, i'll be back shopping soon!! joy hammitt business owner and mother of three ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just want to say thank you for having plus sized models, it is hard to buy lingerie when you are a dress size 26 off of a model who is maybe a size 2. i love how sexy the plus sized models look in the fabolous lingerie...thank you! tabitha white ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear h&c, at first i was disappointed that my exact order was not in stock, but now that the garter belt, boy shorts, and thigh highs (in nude!) came in the mail i could not be happier! i chided myself for gaining weight in college and really hadn't thought i could ever look this sexy. your company has just sent my confidence through the roof. thank you so much! i'm sure i'll be splurging with you again soon. carrie ~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to say "thank you!". i received a phone call and one of your associates to tell me that one of the items i ordered was not available in that color. i told her to give me a different color, but i was a little disappointed. you see, i am about to move and could not wait until the color became available. i would no longer be at that address. and because we are a military family, i didn't know what my new address would be yet. i just got my order, and to my surprise the original color i wanted was there! there was also a note from her saying that she had found one more hiding for me. i was so excited. you guys are helping me make me and my husbands reuniting perfect! i just think that you guys went above and beyond what i have experienced from other retailers. normally, you don't find out until you receive the package or you just get an email that it wasn't available and you won't be charged for it. thank you for your wonderful customer service and i will definately be a return customer. rvl ~~~~~~~~~~~ hello, i'm a first time customer of yours and i must say i am very impressed. i am really happy i found your website. i ordered the rhumba panties in black and they just came in today. i love them! let me tell you it was great to come home from a long day at work and have something new and sexy to slip in to. being a plus size woman, sometimes i get discouraged by the media's ideal of beauty and it gets me down, but i feel like a goddess now, filled with great new self-esteem. now i know how truly sexy and beautiful i can be. i can't thank you enough. you have a wonderful website and amazing products. i'll be sure to order from you again. thank you for doing what you do! sarah from wisconsin ~~~~~~~~~~~ i recieved my order today, i ordered something sexy for my self & a lil something for my hubby. i must say that after several attempts with other places to find something i could be happy with & being let down almost every time when my order came all i could do was sing praises to you guys. i got just what i was told i would get, it fit better that i expected & i have never been so satisfied. i am a big confident beautiful woman that has found it hard to find just the right fit when it came to clothes because what's 2x in one store doesn't quite seem the same size in another, & most stores i find that the only "plus size" outfits they offer all look like "old granny clothes" or circus tents. a big girl can be sexy too! & for as long as i have been a big woman i have found that when it comes to clothes "it's hard out there" but you my beautiful "hips and curves" just made it a hell of a lot easier! my husband & i thank you!!!! a&r, new mexico ~~~~~~~~~~~ hi there, i just took a look at the photo gallery. i just wanted to send a thank you for adding it, i love your site! whenever i am not feeling very good about my weight, i come to visit your site. i can tell you that after visiting, i feel so much better. i am also glad that you offer plus size sexy things modeled by plus size women. i hate to admit it, but i kinda get offended by plus size clothes sites that have all tiny women modeling plus size clothes and i won't shop with them. weird hey? lol!! i know. thank you for making me and a lot of women feel sexy! ty ~~~~~~~~~~~ i recently ordered the chopper bar lace shelf bra for my gf, and she looks fantastic in it.........not only that but she said she felt sexy and comfortable wearing it....thanks from a very satisfied customer..... d.c. ~~~~~~~~~~~ dear hips and curves, when i saw your sexy product line modeled by ashanna, the winner of the "tyra banks show: top plus size model" yesterday, i became your biggest fan. i identified with ashanna in your intimate wear - she is about my size, shape, age and ethic mix. i never thought about wearing intimate apparel before seeing her model because i did not know a product such as your existed - one that exemplifies sexiness and is cut to flatter "curvy" bodies. needless to say, i got right online and "googled" your company to find out more! i have several friends my size (12/14) and i have been sure to spread the word that there is a company out there that is keeping us sexy in '06 and hips and curves is it! i'd love to see you give victoria's secret some real competition! you have an amazing product - and ashanna was the perfect fit to represent it. i am confident your business with prosper - especially with a beauty like ashanna representing the company! congratulations to ashanna and hips and curves!!! n. jimenez, california ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just want to say thank you! i was so excited when i found your site, i placed an order and within a few days my package was waiting for me. the items i purchased made my wedding night and honeymoon a time we will both never forget. i was so nervous about ordering online, i have yet to find anything else that fits as good and makes me feel good about myself the way your lingerie does. i have shared your site with several friends and their husbands are soo happy too. thanks again! kh, texas ~~~~~~~~~~~ just a note to let you know i am very pleased with your services. i couldn't believe how fast your company made the shipping, definitely this is a plus in addition i was not sure about ordering but gave it a try. beside the timeliness of your service the items were just gorgeous and i was amazed it actually fit. not only fit but i felt very comfortable with the garments on. i just had to congratulate you for your services overall and thank you so much for thinking on the plus size woman out here. i made a second order a week after and i can assure you it will not be the last. i have also spread the word to friends and family. once again congrats. you guys are awesome. m.a. in puerto rico ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to say thank you for my order. i was quite surprised finding the package on my doorstep this morning--i just placed the order on monday!!! and the quality!!! it's not often when you can say "it looks better in person than it did in the picture." i will definitely be ordering from your company in the future!!! please forward this email on to your supervisor, because he/she needs to know what excellent service you are providing!! sincerely, a., sacramento, ca ~~~~~~~~~~~ about 2 weeks ago i found your web sight and was very pleased with the selection you offer. my wife and i love to look and shop online, but many sights do not have the right sizes for her 5'4" 38d (natural) 41 hips and 36 waist. finding lingerie that will fit is almost imposable. after talking her into trying one last time to order some fun lingerie we placed an order on a sunday. 2 days later the package arived and to both of our suprise it all fit and she looks killer in it. thanks again and you have 2 new and very happy customers for a long time to come sincerely, r.k.a., arizona ~~~~~~~~~~~ i took my package up in my bedroom and when i opened the red lace teddy and matching robe i was just so impressed by the shade of red. i never realized that it would have those adorable bows to accentuate it and when i put it on to try it, i couldn't believe it, it fit so nice and it felt wonderful to have on. such expensive quality for such a low price makes it even better. then i looked at the satin teddiette and just couldn't believe how elegant and exciting that outfit was. at least when you put them on you don't feel like you look like a clown, you actually feel like they are made just for you. anyway, between you and i, i am looking forward to trying them on for my husband :) and i will try that advice about the garters as i thought that maybe i should try it that way. i will look forward to keeping an eye on your site and seeing what else i might pick. thanks for your personal service, which you do not get from the "bigger" names, neither do you get this quality. until later... sincerely, b.s., pa ~~~~~~~~~~~ you guys rock! i called on thursday to order a pleather dress and boots and all the goodies but i needed them the next day and you came through! i had my order by 1 pm and i look so hot!!! thanks again for your awesome service. the woman that helped me on the phone was the best and let me know that my boots may not make it but i so appreciate the honesty and they made it so i am thrilled that i will be rockin your clothes at the exotic erotica ball in san francisco tomorrow night! thanks again! sincerely, b.a. ~~~~~~~~~~~ just wanted to drop you a line to say "thanks for being there." i have been a "big girl" my entire life and finally finding a website that can satisfy my cravings to be sexy in lingerie that actually fits has truly been a miracle. my husband and i enjoyed a wonderful sex life before - but now? in his words, "wow." he loves it when i meet him at the door at the end of his day wearing nothing but a black body stocking, stockings with garters, or anything else in my now-expanding collection of lingerie. i can't explain why, but something about lingerie makes me feel sexier and more feminine than i ever have before. so, thanks again, and keep up the great work! give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done! also, it is wonderful not having to wait so long for something special to arrive in the mail! sincerely, a very happy customer! t.g. ~~~~~~~~~~~ hi hips and curves.... i got my first order this week already...it came in lightening time and i am very pleased....with not only the quality, but the price and fit also. i just knew this was the shop for me! the thongs fit like they were tailored for me and the stockings go to just the right place on my thighs....love 'em, love 'em!! i will be ordering something again soon. thank you for what you do for me and for making this a place that i can feel georgous in everyway!! i have added it to my yahoo profile as a link and hope that you get more customers from that. thanks, miss kk ~~~~~~~~~~~ to whomever it may concern, i am so enspired by your web sight. it is beautiful and sexy. i am looking forward to purchasing some of your products and wearing them for you and for my husband. i am 5 foot 8 and 1/2 and weigh around 186 pounds. i would love to be posted on your sight but first i need to make some pictures!!!. i just wanted to say thank you for this sight and i will be checking it out continuously so please send me newsletters a.s.a.p.!!! thanks again for helping out the bigger women of today! gg, canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ i love sexy lingerie....and am going to be one of your best customers now. i just found this website. how wonderful that you understand the needs and desires of us big girls....we are just a sexy and beautiful as our smaller counterparts. maybe even more so....eat your hearts out skinnys!! thanks for this great stuff! k.k. in south dakota ~~~~~~~~~~~ i have to tell you what just happened. my wife had me go to the post office to pick up a package that we missed delivery on. little did i know it was her hips and curves lingerie order. when i arrived home she took the package and went to our bedroom. she was back downstairs about five minutes later and i almost had a heart attack. she was wearing a black lace garter, black stockings and matching crotchless panties. her bra was open front with her gorgeous breasts waiting to be touched. needless to say the evening went well. thank you hips and curves for putting a fire back in our relationship! larry and maggie, jamestown, nd ~~~~~~~~~~~ like a lot of men in this country, i am so tired of the anorexic look in women that is so popular currently. personally, i like women who look like women, not young boys, so your models are a refreshing change and look absolutely stunning! your product line is beautiful, creative and fun! my wife is a plus size and i think she's gorgeous! we placed an order and will place others i'm sure. your products celebrate real women instead of trying to make perfectly beautiful females feel like there is something wrong with them. all i can say is bravo!! we wish you all the success that you richly deserve. b.o. in concord, ca ~~~~~~~~~~~ i want to express my gratitude for your service. i am getting married very soon and found that i had totally forgotten lingerie. knowing that it is almost impossible to find lingerie for big women in local stores, i turned to the net and started scouring sites. your company not only had some of the lowest prices but also offered express shipping. other sites said it would be up to a week just to get the product out the door - our day would have been over before i ever received it. i was a bit skeptical, as this was the first time i've dealt with your company, but you delivered as promised. keep up the good work! j.c. st. paul, mi ~~~~~~~~~~~ my husband and i just tried out the glow in the dark crotchless panties. they were all i'd hoped for. the husband here definitely everything i'd hoped for thanks! j&j penfield, ne ~~~~~~~~~~~ i've spent the past half hour or so perusing your website, which i stumbled upon by accident (i'm assuming by accident - i don't even remember how i got there). i have to say that i am impressed! being a plus-size woman i've had trouble in the past finding beautiful, sexy, flirty lingerie in my size. most of what i can find that fits, isn't really what i like. i want to look like the goddess-girl i am, not some frumpy housewife who doesn't much care. your site is full of the kinds of things that, until now, i only wished i could find. i am in heaven and i think my boyfriend will be too. thank you thank you thank you!!! m.m. flushing ne ~~~~~~~~~~~ my most recent order was the flower lace bodystocking in black. i tried it last night and it is the best thing i have ordered thus far! it is so easy to put on and take off. it is comfortable and cool which is great because the weather is getting hot. i even was comfortable to do laundry in it and eat dinner in it...haha!! i wear it around to do housework to give my husband a little visual stimulation. because i have a larger bust i am difficult to fit, so that is one of the reasons for my excitement at finding this item. my husband loved it because it is see-through and stretchy, which allowed him to do whatever he pleased with his hands. he also loved that it is crotchless! i cannot tell you how happy i am with my latest find. i love all your lingerie because it fits so well and is so sexy and comfortable. s.c. ~~~~~~~~~~~ i love my new bra! i wear a 38ddd. i recently wore my new lace open tip bra to a mardi gras party under a black fitted blouse. my date could not keep his eyes off of me. so many times he said how beautiful i looked and asked what i had done differently. only later did he discover my secret. thank you for this special treat! cassie g. ~~~~~~~~~~~ thank you!!!! i can't remember when i placed this order of mine but all i could say is thank you!! it came so quickly and i love it!!! when my husband returns from iraq i think we're going to have a little too much fun considering i bought dvd of how to strip. awesome job! thank you so very much. i will be purchasing more and bringing others with me. thank you for looking out for the "big girls"!!!! s.w. ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to write you and say thank you! i gave the outfit to my girlfriend on saturday as a christmas present and she loved it! it made her feel pretty and sexy. she looked so good in it. she insisted on keeping it on when we made love. it's the fist time she's worn clothing like this and now she loves it. now she's browsing the site and is going to pick out something else that she likes for our weekend away. thank you once again for all of your help. a very happy customer in canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ my wife is a plus size lady. recently we celebrated her 34th birthday - and our 10th wedding anniversary. she had been feeling down. i noticed she was looking for some intimate apparel to make our anniversary special a while back, but none was found in her size. her birthday was coming up and i started looking around and found your site!!! well i couldn't believe my eyes! here was what she had been looking for, something that would bring her sex appeal and confidence up. i think she wondered if i still found her appealing, which i definitely do! well i bought a baby doll outfit with the open panties and a sheer robe with a thong. we received them on the day of her birthday and was she ever surprised! now i'm not going to say it made her a new woman or any other outlandish claims, but she has had a twinkle in her eye and a smile on her face that i haven't seen for a very long time. not to say it doesn't put a smile on my face either. so i thank you for your store and your fine selection. she has been looking through your site at other things to wear and i can hardly wait to see what she picks out for herself. oh by the way, did i mention she is a nurse? i wonder if i could talk her into a nurse's uniform and we could play doctor. what do you think? a very happy husband in memphis ~~~~~~~~~~~ i, being a full figured gal, just love your web sight; your lingerie is so sexy and it fits me so well and makes me feel so sexy. my husband loves when i go on your sight because that means that i am either buying something that will make him drool or that i'll be reading one of the sexy and romantic stories that make me hot. s.c. ~~~~~~~~~~~ yes, there are a few of us average sized males who believe plus sized women have the corner market on sex appeal. those heroin addict, skeletal looking, lettuce chomping fashion models truly turn me off. even the three little pigs knew you didn't build a house out of sticks if you're going to spend any time in it. so when i recently discovered this website i immediately signed up for the newsletter. i'm supposed to be working right now but every day this week i find myself coming back to this site. sexy, it is. more letters, you need. i agree that each and every one of you curvaceous women need to flaunt their robust, lusty bodies unashamedly. g.l. grand rapids, mi ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am commenting about a newsletter that i read from hips and curves. a reader asked if curvy women get noticed as much as skinny women. i believe that if a woman feels sexy and beautiful, that is what she expresses to others. if you take the time to give special attention to the special person you are, either with clothing, make-up, sexy lingerie a new hairstyle, etc. then i truly believe it shows. i am a curvy lady, full of confidence. there is nothing better than getting dressed up in the most sexiest outfit, that shows all my awesome curves, and watch men look me up and down when i walk by. i have met several men that say there is nothing better than a curvaceous woman that is proud of who she is. shelly in alturas, ca ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just received my order. i am planning on celebrating my 16th anniversary with my husband in mexico in three weeks, and was very pleased that not only did the order arrive in time, but everything was correct. the pictures on your website do not do the colors of the lingerie hips & curves! everything was gorgeous and a perfect fit! it's nice to find a place that makes plus sized clothes that are flattering, yet sized in such a way that one may order with confidence. angela - turlock, ca ~~~~~~~~~~~ i received my order on friday and all my man could say was, "dayum....dam dam dam!!!!!!!!" so, thanks for the fast shipment, and the lovely teddy!!!!!! l. taylor ~~~~~~~~~~~ to whom it may concern, i wanted to take a moment & let you know how nice it's been to find your web site. i had been looking for some new & "fun" wardrobe additions & you have it all. i recently purchased a couple different items. the delivery was amazingly fast, and the pricing was reasonable. i also find your site refreshing in the fact that you make shopping for these types of items what it should be; exciting, fun, and not dirty... (unless you want it to be!) i look forward to shopping more with your company. thank you for your time and keep up the good work. r.t. tallahassee, fl ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am so excited i found your site! i'd never heard of you before, but you can believe that i will be back for more. not only are the prices sweet, but the selection has everything from tasteful virgin to nasty slut!!! my husband is going to love you guys. i'll bet he'll never get upset that i'm spending money on your website. d.d. seattle, wa ~~~~~~~~~~~ i ordered a baby doll peignoir. it arrived today and i love it!! i just ordered another of a different style. i've been to every plus-size oriented retail store imaginable and could never find anything i liked or that fit me right. i will recommend this site to all my friends! m.d. colorado springs, co ~~~~~~~~~~~ i can't tell you how much i appreciate all the help you've given. i'd love to know more about your company. how large are you guys? it's so refreshing to find a company who truly understands what customer service means. i leave tomorrow for bar harbor where i am going to meet up with my long distance love interest, sam. i've told him how great you've been and he sends his thanks as well. we're taking a cruise in february, so you know i'll be ordering more stuff! s.s. wake forest, nc ~~~~~~~~~~~ thank you, thank you, thank you! i will never buy lingerie from any other website but yours. i have already recommended you to two of my friends. you are wonderful! thanks again! c.c. layton, ut ~~~~~~~~~~~ my boyfriend, matthew, absolutely loves my thighs. i'm on the bigger side, 14/16 to be exact and i have a 38d chest. he loves it when i'll drive over to his house wearing nothing but a pair of sexy lace panties and the right bra. his favorite thing to do is to have me lie down, and put his head on my thighs. i don't know why that is really, what's so arousing about my thighs. he says he likes women who have a bit more to them, "i like the chicks who go for the meat and potatoes, not the air crisps and lettuce only chicks." those are his exact words! so don't worry ladies. plus sized women are ten times more gorgeous than skinny ones. so be proud! dress sexy! strut your stuff! k.g. wooster, oh ~~~~~~~~~~~ i sent an order to your company and requested 2nd day air delivery. i was pleasantly surprised when the package came a day after the order was filled. my wife and i have not yet had the time to enjoy our purchase, but the speed and professionalism with which this was dealt with has brought a smile to my face. i am sure it will be surpassed, however, when i see my wife in this lovely leather corset. thank you for being a plus size lingerie store and thank you for the quick and courteous manner our business was handled. you will have my business again and that of my close friends and family. i know several other plus size ladies who would love to see the items you offer. thank you so much! m.d. colorado springs, co ~~~~~~~~~~~ i am a supervisor in the customer support division in my department and the service you provided me with is what i would love to see out of my people. thank you for the excellence and professionalism. thank you so much! t.t. in california ~~~~~~~~~~~ consider yourself "bookmarked" on my computer. i'm thrilled to see what you're doing. your customer photo gallery is neat. i think we'll be seeing a lot more women of our "stature" in the market, especially with body image coming to the front. when larger sized women fell "worth it" we'll adorn ourselves happily and confidently. liz a. ontario, canada ~~~~~~~~~~~ i just wanted to send an email regarding one of your customer service representatives. she helped me with a return and was polite and professional and quick to respond. i just wanted to let you know that i am happy with my purchases, as well as the great customer service!!! i spent 8 years working as a financial analyst and supervisor for customer financial services with a major telecom company and i know that helping and keeping customers happy is what keeps them coming back. n.l. ~~~~~~~~~~~ customer care worry-free shopping! order infomy accountpayment methodsshipping policyorder trackingprivacy & securityabout uscompany infomediaaffiliate programsmodel searchcareersshopping toolssite mapemail signupsize chartsgift registry/wishlistgift cards © 2008 hipsandcurves.com - all rights reserved privacy policy  | affiliate program added to bag x added to wishlist x
