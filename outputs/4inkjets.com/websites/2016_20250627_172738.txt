"so if you can just mail it to the billing address i entered because that is my parents address down the street then i will be able to get it and again that billing address is..... so again regarding order # ..... please do not mail it to the mailing address of ....because once again i do not have a key .. so please mail it to the billing address of ..... and if any one has any questions i can be reached at telephone number ........... well, the next day or so i received an email stating that my order has been shipped to the mailing address of ...... so i called customer service and told richard who by the way was extremely nice, the entire scenario and he said that he would keep an eye out for it so if it returned then he would have it shipped back out to the billing address instead of the mailing address and of course i had mentioned to him something along the lines of "no big deal but why put in the confirmation email that if there is any problems then call asap and leave a message if no one is going to listen to the voice mails" again, no big deal but ..... so thank goodness it just so happened that the building manager was around when the mail man came and he gave my package to the building manager who dropped it off at my door. so all was well. i did call customer service back and let the lady know who answered about all of the above and told her to please make a note that i did receive my stuff so no one needs to keep an eye out for it and to also please let richard know that he does not need to keep an eye out for it because i did get it. just did so out of courtesy as i know most people nowadays would not call and let someone know that package was received and all is well ... and the very nice lady who answered did say "thank you so much for calling and letting us know" so, bottom line, great customer service i received from both richard and the lady i spoke to on the 2 occasions i did call .... but again maybe someone needs to take a look at that email that is sent out , the confirmation of the order email , where it states.."any problems call us asap b/c emails won't be received in time..." because it should not state to leave a message of the problem if no one is going to listen to the companies voice mails........i hope this all makes sense. thank you.- jen, 11/10/2016 i've been with you for many years since i attended the concord law school in los angeles and really appreciate your services. thank you for being nice. debbie beswick- pinky, 11/10/2016 1st purchase experience very good. hope the product is as pleasing!- tim, 11/9/2016 this is my first time to order from 4inkjets. i'll know how much i like it after i get the order. ordering was easy.- dot, 11/9/2016 i've been using your products for years with a variety of inkjet printers. you've probably saved me hundreds of dollars by now. service is always great, including a little troubleshooting now and then. i wouldn't go anywhere else.- cactusx, 11/9/2016 have ordered from thm for last thre years. real pleased iwth their products and sevice. free shippingis a nice +.- online user, 11/9/2016 great ink- jr, 11/8/2016 i have been buying from 4inkjet for over years and i find all their products meet my needs for all my equipment from xerox to hp- online user, 11/8/2016 great products at a great price.- online user, 11/7/2016 excellent and convenient source to purchase toner supplies.- online user, 11/7/2016 i'm so happy that the product is reasonably priced.- silver, 11/7/2016 great product!
