why have i not received my order? how can i track my order? i am getting a new printer, what do i do with my old one? why is my new ink cartridge not printing? this can happen to cartridges with attached print heads such as hp, lexmark or dell. all cartridges are weighed and tested before leaving the factory so lack of ink isn't the problem. it usually has to do with the print head of the cartridge not having any ink to feed it. this happens because cartridges are kept flat or upside down for weeks or months before being used and the ink settles away from the print head. the easiest remedy is to open the box and stand the cartridge upright for a few minutes before using. then get a damp paper towel, fold it into quarters and sit the cartridge print head down onto it. hold the cartridge down to the damp paper towel for three minutes. this will help pull the ink out of the print heads, priming them and getting them ready to print. finally, install the cartridge into your printer and print a few test pages. why didn't my cartridge print the full amount of pages? why was the yield lower than what was quoted online? customers often worry about the yield of their cartridges. they often mistakenly try to track yield by time. the amount of time it takes for a cartridge to go empty is a bad indicator of yield. the cited yield for ink and toner cartridges is given at 5% coverage. this is usually not a lot of print on a page. typically only a short memo is at 5% coverage. if you are printing letters, using legal size paper, printing photos, web pages or doing any kind of graphics your coverage will vary greatly. this will cause the yield to drop greatly. there are two ways to properly check for yield. first is to utilize any page count your printer has. refer the user's manual for instructions. the other way is to count reams or boxes of paper you have used with each cartridge. both of these methods will tell you how many pages per cartridge you are using. both methods give you a raw number. you should also take into account your typical print coverage. if you only do memos then you should reach the manufacturer's stated yield specifications. if you write full page letters or print graphics your yield will be considerably less. when printing text and full page graphics a 4000 page yield cartridge will run out of toner in around 800 pages. introduced in june 2004, the iso/iec 19752 standard method for testing page yield was introduced. it created a comprehensive process to test page yields. this standard method means that from now on all printer manufacturers and cartridge manufacturers will be quoting ink and toner cartridge yields using the same testing process. on the right you can see the sample page that is used to test yield. if your documents have more page coverage you will get drastically lower page yields from each inkjet or toner cartridge. why am i getting an error message when i install my new cartridge? the most common error messages are listed below, as well as trouble shooting techniques to help eliminate any type of error message. if you are still unable to get rid of the error message please call our customer service department at 888-321-2552. a message asking you to replace your black/color inkjet cartridge the cartridge light blinks on the printer. a message that ask you to check your black/color inkjet cartridge. a message that indicates the cartridge is not seated properly. a message that indicates there is no cartridge installed how to fix the problem: cartridges that do not have an internal print head (epson, brother, canon,) a lot of times this is caused by the chip on the cartridge not making direct contact with the printer sensors. all you need to do is open the area of the printer where your cartridges are installed. remove the problematic cartridge from its designated port and reinstall the cartridge to ensure it is properly seated, secured, and that the chip is lined up with the printer censor. close the printer cover and proceed to turn off the printer. wait a few a few seconds and restart your printer. proceed to print a test page and you should be good to go. if this problem still occurs please call our customer service department at 888-321-2552. cartridges that have an internal print head (hp, lexmark and some canon) this is caused by the cartridge not making proper contact with the printer. this may also be caused by unclean contact points on the print head. open the area where your cartridges are installed and remove the problematic cartridge. then completely power down your printer for 2-3 minutes by unplugging the printer from its power source. as you wait you can clean the print head on the bottom of the cartridge with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. then power your printer back up, reinstall your cartridge making sure it is seated correctly, and that itâs in its designated slot. your cartridge should be recognized and ready to print. if this problem still occurs please call our customer service department at 888-321-2552. why does it say my cartridge is empty when i install it? all of our cartridges are inspected before packaging to ensure that the cartridge was filled with the correct amount of ink. the chances of actually receiving an empty inkjet are incredibly rare. a lot of times this reading is caused by the cartridge not being properly seated in its designated slot. we suggest that you remove the cartridge and reinstall it, make sure that it snaps into place and that it is seated correctly and securely. please take into consideration that your printer doesnât actually read the ink level of the cartridge. in fact the printer software determines the level of ink by remembering the number of pages that were printed when the previous cartridge was installed, which then estimates how much ink is remaining and when it should be replaced. if you install your new cartridge before you let the printer driver reset there is a chance that the printer may think you are still using the old empty cartridge. one way of fixing this issue is to reinstall your cartridge and click on the install new cartridge option; you may have to refer to your printerâs manual for further instructions. this will indicate to your printer that a new cartridge has been installed which will then prompt it to reset the internal page counter. this should eliminate that message, if further assistance is needed please call our customer service department at 888-321-2552. some cartridges come in big sets for example, 4 black and 2 of each color. can the cartridges be mixed around within the set so that we can get more of one color than others? no. the cartridge sets can not be mixed. we have price breaks on the individual colors so you can order them individually to get better prices on them. how can i get dried ink out of my inkjet print head so i can print again? place the clogged cartridge in about 1/4 - 1/2 inch of warm water for a few minutes. when ink starts to slowly leak out take the cartridge out of the water and dry it using a soft cloth to "q-tip." then place it back in your printer and run the print head cleaning utility that comes with your printer software. you may have to run this 2-4 times before printing quality is reestablished. if your print head is damaged you will have to buy a new cartridge as the print head cannot be repaired. why does the cartridge i received look bigger than the one that's already in my printer? a majority of our remanufactured cartridges are equipped with a protective clip that must be removed before installation. this is an l shaped clip that runs along the side of the cartridge. this is provided to protect the cartridge from any possible damage. this will make your cartridge seem a lot larger than the cartridge in your printer. please open the package and carefully remove the protective clip as well as any protective tape that is covering the print head of the cartridge. if you still need further assistance please call our customer service at 888-321-2552. how should i handle my cartridge? never touch the electronic print head with any abrasive material. use care when setting your cartridges down and do not place the print head in contact with any surface besides the printer. what is the best way to store my cartridges? it is always ideal to store your cartridges in a room temperature setting. it is also a good idea to store your cartridges in an upright position. a lot of times during shipment these units are not sitting in an upright position and ink will tend to settle at the opposite end of the cartridge which may cause printing issues. ideally before use you want to have your cartridge sit in the upright position for a couple of hours to ensure that the ink moves to the bottom of the cartridge allowing the ink to pass through the sponge, which will allow the cartridge to print properly. does the letter at the end of the hp inkjet cartridge part number matter? for example, if the cartridge is a c6656a will the c6656an work as well? the letter at the end of hp ink cartridge numbers signifies the volume. most hp cartridges only have one type such as the #56 which you will also see shown as the c6656, c6656a and c6656an. hp sometimes shows the cartridge as the 56a or c6656a, but the full part number is c6656an. all versions are the same product with the same ink volume. only if the first letter after the numbers was different would it be the same cartridge with a different volume. other first letters at the end such as 51645g and 51645a are the identical cartridge, but with different volumes. the g is the free starter cartridge that comes with a printer and the a is the regular high volume cartridge that is sold in stores. when our cartridges are manufactured we always fill the cartridges completely. so, regardless of the letter at the end of part number or the letter you are used to order you will always get a high volume cartridge for us. why don't you carry epson refill kits? epson printer incorporate a high quality print head onto their printers instead of disposable print heads on their cartridges. so, due to the sensitivity of the epson print head we do not endorse or sell refill kits for epson printers. what is a remanufactured inkjet cartridge? these professionally remanufactured inkjet cartridges are original manufacturer's brand inkjet cartridges which have been through one cycle of service and have been recharged. every inkjet cartridge has been thoroughly cleaned along with the printhead nozzles. then the cartridge is filled with the same ink formulation, checked if it has the correct internal atmospheric pressure, inspected for any possible shell leakage, tested the operation of all electrical circuitry and finally ran through an actual print test. if the cartridge passes our rigid standards, it has been remanufactured! what are inkjet refill kits and how can they save me money? inkjet cartridge refilling consists of personally recycling your empty inkjet cartridges so they can be used again. using inktec refill kits you can refill your cartridge 2-6 times using our tools, high quality ink, patented refill clip, and easy to follow pictured and written instructions. refilling allows you to save money compared to buying new cartridges and help the environment at the same time. universal refill kits and ink quality information ink quality is the most important part of refilling. the print head on your cartridge may get clogged or destroyed by the inks that can not match the oem's specifications. inktec inks are formulated and tested under strict laboratory conditions to ensure the highest output quality at all times as compared with other oem products. how many times can i refill my inkjet cartridge?
