trusted 3rd parties steve m. after having had several orders with sd bullion, i'm very pleased to report that all my transactions have been flawless and the service has been wonderful. as long as the prices remain competitive and often times less than the competition, i will be a customer. george b. i love sd bullion... they are very attentive to my every question. their products are the best, and shipping is fast and secure. i will use this company for all of my bullion purchases. oh, did i mention... they are almost always the best price, and when you find anything advertised for less... they will match it. but, i've never found anywhere else less expensive! ... i'm still working on that one... christian q. i would have to say as a person who was new to purchasing silver, sd bullion made it really easy for me to purchase their products and even offered protective cases for the coins for a couple of dollars or even cents more. i do enjoy that feature. i enjoy that they have a wide selection of coins to choose from at great prices and also have coins not common or seen on other silver websites. the delivery time was quick and i got my coins (rounds) faster than i expected considering that it had snowed. overall i would have to say i really enjoy sd bullion and will continue to do business with them. keeley d. coins came discreetly packaged on time. shipping time was quick and product was as described and high quality. shopped around and even though they charge for shipping their low prices will always offset the price so you will be paying less altogether than any other site. derek l. i have had a good experience with sd bullion. they have a wide range of products,with great customer service,and low prices. i can buy with confidence, knowing they have the knowledge and technology to keep me safe from buying fakes,forgeries, and knock-offs, thank you, dl. jonathan w. this is my first time investing and i am very satisfied with the overall navigation of the site. very impressive and easy to understand for a small-time investor such as myself. diane l. the site was so easy to get around--with anything you might want to purchase at whatever cost. it was quick, clear, and i so appreciated my first experience. there will be many many more. there is really no sense at looking at other sites (in my opinion). free investing guide click here to get

time frame stated. very pleased with the service. john l. sd bullion sales and service team are exceptional. i initially had an issue with a credit card transaction for the purchase of silver product. they were responsive and very helpful in identifying the problem and making sure that the transaction went smoothly the next time i purchased silver products. i will use sd bullion in the future for my silver purchases. thomas g. i would like to give a review for s.d. bullion which i would rate a 5 star business that i have been buying from for the last couple years. they have been honest and
