page next buy gold bullion bars buying gold bars is one of the most popular ways to buy gold bullion online today. gold bars are normally priced lower than gold coins so gold bullion stackers prefer them a lot of times for this reason. gold bars also allow you to accumulate a lot of precious metal value in a small format. for example, an ounce of gold has traded for $1,500 to $2,000 over the last decade. an ounce of gold is pretty small and takes up very little space. therefore, it's very easy for hard asset investors to protect hundreds or thousands of fiat dollars in a small cubic space. if you're a large volume investor, you can buy one kilo gold bars that easily fit in your hand, but holds thousands of dollars of value in precious metal. but you don't have to be a large investor to get started buying gold bullion bars. you can start off with 1 gram,. 5 gram or 10 gram gold bars. these gold bars still contain significant fiat dollar value and they also fit any investor budget out there. how to buy gold bars gold bars are usually weighed in troy ounce, but there are also some mints that produce them in grams. another aspect to consider is the production method. minted gold bars bear a smoother surface and may include designs celebrating national symbols, and cultural representations, whereas cast gold bars tend to be heavier options with more simplistic engravings. finally, consider picking products from prominent mints. because they are usually more sought-after, it will likely be faster to resell them (if you decide to do so) than lesser-known mints. gold bullion bars can be minted from government mints like the royal canadian mint (rcm) or private mints like the highly recognized pamp suisse. buying gold bars is a popular investment for both new and experienced physical precious metal investors and long term gold bullion savers. keep reading to learn more about our products. size traditionally, the most popular sizes are the  1 oz gold bar or 5 oz. they offer a flexible investment with sensible premiums. larger bars could be a savvy choice for those willing to make a considerable investment while enjoying lower premium percentages. 10 oz to 1-kilo gold bars is usually the choice. you can also find smaller gold bars, from 1 gram to 10 grams. because most premiums are percentage-based, they could offer lower premiums in terms of gross value than larger ones. they are also easier to handle and store. price gold bar prices are based on the spot gold price, which is a fluctuating value that rises and falls according to live transactions at mercantile markets such as lbma and comex. however, the spot price serves only as a base, but usually does not correspond to the final price of a gold bar. bullion dealers usually add a percentage over the spot price in order to meet business costs and still make a profit. that is called a premium. prices on gold bullion bars can range from a couple dozen dollars on small gram gold bars to tens of thousands in kilo gold bars. and they are constantly updated on our website according to the current gold spot price. minted vs. cast the difference here is in relation to the production method chosen by the mint. cast gold bars are simply made by pouring the molten metal into a mold. they have simple marks on the surface, usually just the weight, purity and the manufacturer logo. a mint gold bar undergoes a more complex process. they are normally made from a cast or a gold ingot that has been rolled to a uniform thickness. those golden sheets are then punched into a die to acquire the precise weight and shape desired, forming what is called blanks. later, the blanks are fed into a minting press to imprint the obverse and reverse designs. government mints vs private mints gold bullion bars are largely available from private mints, such as pamp suisee, valcambi and argor-heraeus. these are some of the most regarded mints in the world. nevertheless, there are also some government-owned mints that produce gold bars for investment purposes. some examples include the royal canadian mint, the australian perth mint, and the british royal mint. enjoy the large assortment of gold bars from the most prominent mints in the world right here at sd bullion. what to look in a gold bar? the bar's producer the bar's producer is also called the mint. there are many mints in the precious metals industry. you can usually find out the gold bar's manufacturer by simply looking on the product's obverse where you will, most likely, find a logo or the name of the mint that produced it. why prominent manufacturers matter choosing a gold bar can be an overwhelming process, given the array of sizes, mints and designs we offer here at sd bullion. the first thing you should be aware of is that an investment-grade gold bar should contain, at least, .999 fine levels of pure gold content. that includes gold bars intended for individual retirement accounts, or iras. thus, the most important factor influencing gold bar prices remains the purity and the weight of the gold bar. however, it is also true that the more regarded and renowned the gold bar's mint is, the more sought-after it will be by investors and bullion dealers worldwide. in other words, it should be easier to resell and to fetch better prices from gold bars produced by renowned manufacturers. for instance, a sovereign national mint, such as the royal canadian mint (rcm) , is easily recognizable by investors worldwide. their products are known to contain top-notch quality. therefore, it's possible that a gold bar from the rcm, much like a gold coin from them, will be easier to sell back to a gold bullion dealer and get a better price than lesser-known mints. the same goes for highly praised private mints, such as pamp suisse or valcambi. investors will recognize their logo and fame all over the globe. thus, they should obtain slightly better prices as well. the bar's weight and purity common weights of gold bars as we have mentioned before, bullion bars come in various sizes and weights. the most common one is the 1 troy ounce gold bar because it usually poses a good value, is easy to handle and store, and has high liquidity. even so, you might find that smaller bars could be a sensible entry point into the precious metals industry. because prices are based on the bar's weight, small gram gold bars do not require a considerable initial investment, and you can still enjoy the possible benefits of bullion investing. on the other hand, seasoned investors might choose larger bars. buying larger amounts of gold bullion at once might help you save on premiums. here are the sizes of gold bars for sale at sd bullion: 1/100th troy ounce; 0.5 gram; 1 gram; 2 grams; 2.5 grams; 5 grams; 10 grams; 20 grams; 1 troy ounce; 50 grams; 5 troy ounces; 10 troy ounces; 1 kilo. the bar's assay card many bullion products come with some form of assay proof, like the assayer's mark engraved on the bar itself. smaller bars, for instance, usually come in a sealed assay card that contains all the relevant information for that piece, like the date of assay, weight, purity, and, sometimes, a serial number. likewise, an assay certificate might be included in the purchase. it also serves as proof of authenticity and the origin of that specific bullion bar or coin. the bar's
