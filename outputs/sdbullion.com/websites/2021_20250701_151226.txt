retirement account which allows citizens to put pretax income into investments that can grow tax-deferred with capital gains or dividend income being taxed until it is withdrawn closer to the citizen’s retirement age. individual taxpayers with traditional iras can contribute up to a specified maximum dollar amount per year. contributions to a traditional ira may be tax-deductible depending on the taxpayer's income, tax-filing status, and other contributing factors. distributions can be taken as early as age 59½. starting after age 70½, account holders must take required minimum distributions (rmds) from their traditional iras. funds removed prior to full retirement eligibility incur a 10% penalty and standard income tax rates. there are exceptions to these penalties for certain situations. monetary distributions from traditional iras are treated as ordinary income and are subjected to income tax. roth ira - (n) an individual retirement account that allows investors to set aside after-tax income up to a specified amount each year. both earnings in the roth ira account and withdrawals after the age of 59½ are tax-free. individual taxpayers with roth iras can contribute up to a specified maximum dollar amount per year. contributions to a roth ira are made with after tax income. roth iras do not require any distributions or withdrawals during the owner’s lifetime. thus if you have enough other income during retirement, you can simply let your roth ira continue to grow tax-free throughout your lifetime. this makes roth iras ideal wealth-transfer vehicles to be passed on to loved ones. roth iras can also be advantageous for any future windfall profit tax scenarios in which bullion holders are possibly scapegoated for having the foresight to prepare for the eventual devaluation of the us dollar and other globally devaluing fiat currencies around the world. in summation with traditional iras, you can avoid taxes with the capital you put into them. with roth iras, you can avoid taxes when you take capital out during your retirement age. of course, with either type of ira, you pay no taxes on the growth of your contributed funds within the traditional or roth ira structure, so long as they remain in their respective ira account and are done in accordance with irs statues. bullion iras are often creditor exempt did you know that all 50 states have either a full or partial exemption from potential creditors abilities to access an individual’s ira assets and holdings? if like us, you live and do business in the usa you are also

various professional’s livelihoods and retirement funds. business owners, cpas, lawyers, doctors, dentists, and other professionals often use individual retirement accounts (iras) as ways to invest and save for the long term. iras offer investors the possibility to use the power of compounding gains in wealth expansion with potential special tax exemptions to help increase a retirement fund’s size. the standard intention for ira investing citizens is to eventually use their ira funds for their post career lifetimes by allowing them to maintain a high living standard without having to work in their old age. practicing business professionals own physical silver and gold iras to help diversify their investment portfolios against standard financial threats (e.g. currency debasements,
