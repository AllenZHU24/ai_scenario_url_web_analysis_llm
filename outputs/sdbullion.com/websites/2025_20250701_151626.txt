the potential benefits of investing in gold bars, keep reading below to learn from sd bullion. gold bullion bars a flat bar struck using .999+ (usually) pure gold is known as a gold bullion bar. gold bars range from small gram sizes to 1 kilo. the wide range of options at sd bullion empowers our clients to find the perfect products tailored to their unique investment goals. the 1-gram, 1-oz, 100-gram, and kilo sizes are the most common weights available in the bullion market. while smaller gold bars offer higher liquidity and easy storage, larger bars usually cost less per ounce. government mints vs private mints gold bullion bars are mainly available from private mints, such as valcambi and argor-heraeus, some of the most regarded mints in the world today. nevertheless, some government-owned mints also create gold bars for investment purposes. some examples include the royal canadian mint, the australian perth mint, and the british royal mint. gold rounds are similar to gold bars in the sense they they are usually struck by private mints and are devoid of face value. however, they are shaped like a coin, being a popular form of investment among collectors as well. what to look for in a gold bar? the mint there are many mints in the precious metals industry. you can usually find out the gold bar's manufacturer by looking at the product's obverse, where you will most likely find a logo or the name of the company that minted it. why prominent manufacturers matter choosing a gold bar can be overwhelming, given the sizes, mints, and designs we offer at sd bullion. first, you should know that an investment-grade gold bar should contain at least .999 fine levels of pure gold content. it is also true that the more regarded and renowned the gold bar's mint is, the more sought-after it will be by investors and bullion dealers worldwide. in other words, reselling gold bars from trusted, renowned manufacturers should make it easier to secure higher prices. for instance, a sovereign national mint, such as the royal canadian mint (rcm), is easily recognizable by investors. their products are known to contain top-notch quality. therefore, it's possible that a gold bar from the rcm, will be easier to sell back to a gold bullion dealer and get a better price than lesser-known mints. the same goes for highly praised private mints like valcambi or argor-heraeus. investors will recognize their logo and fame worldwide and should also obtain slightly better prices. the bar's assay card many bullion products come with some form of assay proof, like the assayer's mark engraved on the bar. in most cases, gold bars also have a unique serial number issued by the refiner. smaller bars, for instance, usually come in a sealed assay card that contains all the relevant information for that piece, like the date of the assay, weight, purity, and, sometimes, a serial number.likewise, an assay certificate might be included in the purchase. it also proves the authenticity and the origin of that specific bullion bar. types of gold bars since there are different companies that produce gold bars, you might expect different production methods as well, which often result in different prices and different perceived values. cast gold bars cast gold bars are made by pouring the molten metal into a mold. the surface has simple marks, usually the weight, purity, and the manufacturer's logo. both hand-poured and cast gold bars begin with gold poured, placed, or injected into a mold. they have a very hand-made look and feel. they may display waffle backs or ripples, as well as pour lines. this is due to the rapid cooling of the gold in the mold and the absence of an enclosed mold. mint gold bars a mint gold bar undergoes a more complex process. they are typically made from a cast or a gold ingot rolled to a uniform thickness. those golden sheets are punched into a die to acquire the desired weight and shape, forming blanks. later, the blanks are fed into a minting press to imprint the obverse and reverse designs. how to choose the right gold bar the bar's weight and purity investment-grade gold bars must be refined to a purity of at least 99.5%. however, most gold bars ranging from 1 gram to 1 kilo are typically refined to 99.9% pure. you can also see this information states as .999 fineness. as mentioned, bullion bars come in various sizes and weights. the most common one is the one troy-ounce gold bar because it usually has good value, is easy to handle and store, and is highly liquid. smaller bars could be a sensible entry point into the precious metals industry. because prices are based on the bar's weight, small gram gold bars do not require a considerable initial investment, and you can still enjoy the possible benefits of bullion investing. overall, smaller gold bars can be a great option for those looking to invest in gold with more flexibility and affordability, though they may come with slightly higher premiums compared to larger bars. on the other hand, seasoned investors might choose larger bars. because gold is priced in bulk, the more gold you buy at once, the more you save in terms of dollar per ounce of gold. here are the sizes of gold bars for sale at sd bullion: 1/100th troy ounce; 0.5 gram; 1 gram; 2 grams; 2.5 grams; 5 grams; 10

percentages. 10 oz to 1-kilo gold bars are the go-to choice if you want to allocate a good amount of your portfolio in gold bullion. however, smaller gold bars, including gram-sized, offer easier

fluctuates according to live transactions at mercantile markets such as lbma and comex. however, the spot price serves only as a base and usually does not correspond to the final price of a gold bar.

dollars for small gram bars to tens of thousands for kilo bars. our website constantly updates its prices according to the current gold spot price. benefits of investing in gold bars diversification

converted into cash. for example, a 1 troy oz gold bar is more liquid than a 1 kilo gold bar. kilo bars are only accessible by investors with a large portfolio. additionally, kilo bars are harder to transport and store, so they are only advisable to larger investors. investment goals investment goals can range from wealth accumulation, protection money, retirement planning, or capital appreciation since gold is often seen as a durable store of value and a hedge against inflation, and its price can rise during geopolitical uncertainty or periods of high inflation. for example, gold prices spiked during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, reaching over $2,000 per ounce, a historical landmark. another record was set in september 2024, the price of gold per ounce fluctuated above $2,600. most importantly, gold is a long-term investment that could potentially outperform stocks. gold bars are some of the most liquid forms of bullion. finally, ira-eligible bars offer investors
