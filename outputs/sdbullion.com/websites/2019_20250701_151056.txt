(smi) republic metals corporation (rmc) since gold bars are mostly traded based on their .999 fine gold content, the difference between a highly recognizable gold mint versus a smaller less recognizable gold mint is typically only a few dollars per troy ounce being bought or sold. the most important factor influencing gold bar prices remains the purity and the weight of the gold bar. virtually all the gold bullion bars we carry are also allowed inside of gold ira's. buy your lowest price guaranteed gold bullion bars with fast discreet delivery any time here at sd bullion. quick linkssilversilver coinssilver barssilver rounds90% silver coins & silver dollarsgoldgold coinsgold barsplatinumplatinum coinsplatinum barssafes & vaults shop by refine category gram gold bars 17 items 1 oz gold bars 14 items 5 oz to kilo gold bars 5 items grade brilliant unc 26 items uncirculated 2 items circulated 4 items n/a 1 item grade service n/a 31 items metal content 1 troy oz 15 items 10 troy oz 2 items 32.15 troy oz 2 items 1 gram 1 item 5 grams 2 items 10 grams 3 items 20 grams 1 item 50 grams 2 items 100 grams 2 items 0.0321 troy oz 1 item mint/ manufacturer republic metals mint 3 items pamp suisse 17 items royal mint 1 item royal canadian mint 2 items scottsdale mint 3 items sunshine mint 1 item valcambi 1 item various mints 4 items price $0.00 - $999.99 32 items $1,000.00 - $1,999.99 4 items $2,000.00 - $2,999.99 1 item $3,000.00 - $3,999.99 0items $4,000.00 and above 1 item release type n/a 15 items year 2018 1 item n/a 31 items various 3 items payment & pricing shipping policies returns & refunds faq blog contact us login at sd bullion, we believe in doing business the old-fashioned way. world class products, the best bullion prices, with industry-top customer service. thank you to our now 100,000+ customers who have made the switch to sd bullion. terms of use | privacy policy | sitemap copyright @ sd bullion, inc order over the phone 1(800)294-8732 monday—thursday 8am—6pm est friday 8am—5pm est get our best bullion deals in your inbox, subscribe to our mailing list below... newsletter test get the latest deals and news! subscribe to our mailing list.subscribe about ssl certificates
