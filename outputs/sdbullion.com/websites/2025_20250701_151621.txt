to purchasing or selling silver bullion, the market value for silver (referred to as "spot price") is the basis for all pricing. view the current spot prices for silver. almost all silver products on our website operate on a silver spot price plus the product premium formula. that is what will determine the final price. for example, if the market value for silver is x and the product premium is y, the final silver price would be x+y=z. premium pricing is mostly consistent per product but the market value for silver changes every minute. our market feed integrates live up-to-the-minute prices from worldwide markets. we offer live and historical market data on our spot prices page. you can customize charts to research and find trends in pricing. this allows you to compare silver to other precious metal types. silver vs gold there are many differences between silver bullion and gold bullion. the first one is that silver is sometimes higher volatility compared to gold in bull vs bear markets. secondly, silver might be more affordable, but it is also a precious metal like gold. in addition, it has never been defaulted on and has no counterparty risk. nonetheless, because it is more affordable, silver requires much more storage space. on top of that, gold is much thinner - pure gold is around 83% smaller than pure silver. since silver requires more space to store, this can translate into higher fees at depositories. when comparing silver vs gold, you shouldn’t miss the fact that silver has a much higher industrial use. around 12% of all gold supply serves for industrial uses. in stark comparison, the industry uses a whopping 56% of the silver supply. that is mainly due to silver's unique features. the last notable difference is in their stockpiles. central banks and governments reportedly have a low stockpile of silver. in contrast, they’re constantly buying and holding literal tons of gold. some factors to consider while comparing silver bullion investments: premium over spot this is one of the main parts of the discussion when we talk about any silver bullion instrument. premium over spot refers to how much more a product is worth (premium charged) over the melt value of silver present in the silver bullion coin, round, or bar. just as a whole is more than the sum of its parts, the value of some bullion products is higher than their intrinsic worth, depending on the minting source, age, and rarity. so, even though some bars, coins, and rounds usually command lower premiums over spot, silver coins may warrant a much higher premium because of their collectible value. also, another reason why coins command a higher premium is the fact that they hold the prestige of being the only government-minted precious metals instruments and thus, enjoy strong demand in the precious metals market. purity most bars, coins, and rounds manufactured across the world, be it in austria, the usa, or china, contain 99.9% pure silver. a few mints, like the royal canadian mint, surpass the typical purity levels by using 99.99% pure silver. in other words, those products are .09% purer than the other options in the precious metals market. susceptibility to counterfeit counterfeiting is an age-old problem when it comes to investing in precious metals. because of this, many mints have introduced markers or counterfeit-proof features. a few examples include the mint mark si™ feature by sunshine minting or the geiger bar uv light-stampings. coins are comparably the safest instrument for investing in physical silver. a sovereign mint produces them and their legal tender status ensures that the anti-counterfeit measures are as stringent as possible. stackability after investing in silver bullion, it is important to store them safely and efficiently. this is where the stackability factor comes into play. value per square inch is most definitely an aspect worth considering when buying silver bullion in bulk quantities. bullion silver bars are easily the most stackable and store-able precious metal products. they offer way more amounts of silver per square inch. silver coins and rounds require casings, tubes, or boxes when storing large numbers. this fact can make them an unwieldy option for massive quantities of silver. brand and/or series the name or series of a bar, round, or coin plays a significant role in the demand for the product. to retain the freedom to invest in or divest out of a particular instrument, as and when the investor wants, it is advisable to stick to famous product names and series like the american silver eagles or canadian maple leafs. hence, at any given time you will be assured of scores of both active buyers and sellers in the market. new vs. secondary market another factor to take into account when purchasing silver instruments is whether to buy new, freshly-minted products or to look for relatively cheaper secondary-market silver goods. like any other product or commodity, everyone automatically prefers shiny and new over "second hand." moreover, there is a widespread myth among some investors that secondary-market precious metals products have a lower resale value because of their condition and lack of finish. nonetheless, in reality, brand-new silver bars and rounds in perfect condition sell at the same rates (considering equal silver weight and purity) as their secondary market counterparts do. however, collectors who treasure silver coins for their collectible value will, in most cases, prefer mint condition and near-perfect condition coins. playing the market for people who want to ‘play the market,’ i.e. buy and sell regularly to earn immediate profits on every transaction, it is essential to invest in silver products that can be moved quickly. although the strategy (buy low and sell high) is simple, investors who want to take this route need to have complete knowledge regarding silver products and the precious metals market, as well as an appetite for risk. these types of investors usually prefer smaller, portable investment vehicles such as silver coins and rounds. smaller purchases people with more limited capital to invest in precious metals cannot divest as much as they would desire. hence, such silver buyers usually prefer less expensive and low-risk silver physical bullion products with lower premiums over spot. they offer a modest appreciation over time – granting them with inflation-proof, financial protection. financial advisers will usually recommend this strategy as a way to hedge against inflation and a good method of balancing portfolios. larger purchasers this particular type of bullion buyer is looking to create a hefty fund to hedge inflation. when seeking to establish a substantial fund, silver bars can be an attractive option. they come in weights as high as 1000 troy ounces. as such, they are easier to stack and store when compared to rounds and coins. however, providing adequate safety and security to this massive quantity of silver can be a tedious task. hence, private, offshore storage depositories, offering top-of-the-line security at reasonable prices, are considered a great option for storage. silver collectors some people appreciate the true beauty of a minted silver coin. take the coins from the famous american silver eagle program for example. their obverses feature weinman’s beautiful walking liberty. the reverses depict mercanti’s rendition of a bald eagle. it includes a shield, symbol of american strength and pride. collectors buy silver products for their ‘artistic’ or ‘collectible’ value rather than their melt value. for them, there is no right or wrong; they should pick the products that they consider aesthetically appealing. as you would have probably figured out by now, all forms of silver products have their purpose in an investment portfolio. hence, a safe and recommended strategy is to allocate a specific ratio (depending on you or the advice of your financial adviser) of every type of silver bullion instrument in your tangible assets. however, it is an entirely personal decision that one must take after careful deliberation.
