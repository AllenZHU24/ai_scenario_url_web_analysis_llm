shop with confidence. we always strive to maintain competitive prices on everything we carry and we will match the regular retail prices at the time of sale for items shipped from and sold by other online retailers. if there is an additional charge for shipping then this must be factored in since we offer free shipping. also, if we lower the price during the return and exchange period, we will match our lower price, upon request.* there are some online sales channels that we will not match. we can not match sellers that sell closeouts, discontinued products, seconds, used goods, old inventory, or counterfeit merchandise. the pictures you see of merchandise in those "stores" isn't what you get in nearly all cases. if you have any questions about whether we'll match an online price please give us a call at 888.288.6500 or send us an email to customerservice@batteries.com. how can i sign up for your newsletters?
