(1 ah = 1,000 mah). overall capacity is influenced by factors like temperature and speed of discharge. a 40 mah battery can discharge 40 milliamps for one hour, 20 milliamps for two hours, and so on. voltage is a measurement of electrical potential, with all batteries being rated in volts dc (direct current). voltage is determined by electrochemical reactions that occur in the battery, which vary according to battery type. silver oxide (1.5 volts) vs. lithium (3 volts) button/coin cell batteries the choice between lithium and silver oxide batteries is a matter of voltage. lithium batteries have a nominal 3 volt output, and silver oxide batteries operate at 1.5 volts. so, you’ll want to find out what type of voltage is required for the device you’re using. the easiest way to do so is by looking at the battery being replaced, which should have all the info you need. battery requirements can also be found in product manuals, and often on the product itself. all coin cell lithium batteries consist of lithium manganese dioxide chemistries (li-mno2), which account for 80% of the lithium battery market. li-mno2 chemistry is denoted by the iec prefix “cr”, which we’ll discuss more below. because it operates at 3 volts, one li-mno2 can replace two alkaline or silver-oxide cells, which function at 1.5 volts. it’s worth noting that voltage can be subject to fluctuate slightly depending on the quality of the battery maker. so, the more reputable the company, the more likely the battery will be of maximal quality. aside from superior capacity compared to alkaline batteries, lithium and silver oxide batteries have better leakage resistance, meaning they are less subject to corrosion, which can damage and destroy your device. they are also more lightweight and heat/cold resistant, functioning better in temperature extremes. there are a couple other aspects of silver oxide batteries worth noting. replacing a mercury button cell, which may be found in older photography equipment, with a silver oxide battery will affect the light meter settings, requiring them to be recalibrated. mercury batteries, which are no longer produced, operated at 1.35 volts, compared to silver oxide's 1.5 volt discharge. also, silver oxide watch batteries may have an "sw" or "w" suffix, which some makers use to denote whether the battery is a low drain (sw) or high drain (w) device. however, the iec simply denotes that a watch battery is compliant with its standards with a "w" suffix, which can be confusing.you can make a reasonable determination of whether a watch or other device is high or low drain type by its features and functionality. if it's backlit, records the temperature and has a calculator, it's probably high drain. if you're not sure, the best way to be certain is to contact the manufacturer for the battery's specifications. when in doubt, go with high drain – they will last longer in both types of devices. battery naming standards the way batteries are named can make it confusing to find what you need. thankfully, once you know the format, the process becomes much easier. every battery has a standardized name. there are multiple sets of battery naming standards, but currently the most prevalent is iec (international electrotechnical commission), though others such as ansi (american national standards institute) may be seen. in an ideal world, button/coin cell batteries will have their iec classification prominently displayed. take a look at the battery on the right. as you can see, it’s a cr2032, which tells you that it is a single cell, round lithium battery with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 3.2 mm. how did we get all that from a few letters and numbers? let’s break it down. the first letter, c, denotes the battery chemistry, in this case lithium. the next letter, r, tells us the battery shape: round. battery shapes can also be flat (f), square (s), and  simply not round (p).finally, the three or four digit reference numbers on the batteries indicate their exact or approximate size as needed. in this case, 2032 tells us that the battery is 20mm in diameter and 3.2mm thick. other modifiers can be used to denote whether a battery consists of multiple cells (a numerical prefix corresponding to cell amount), whether it’s a high or low drain device and more. in silver oxide batteries, the sw suffix corresponds to use in a low drain device, while w refers to use in high drain devices.[3] refer to the chart below for a full list of button/coin cell battery types and nomenclature. lithium coin cell battery conversion chart iec names sony coin cells valuepaq coin cells typical capacity(mah) standard discharge current(ma) dimensionsd. × h.(mm) comments cr927 30 9.5 × 2.7 used extensively in blinkies. also used in some lego toys. cr1025 30 0.1 10 × 2.5 cr1130 11.5 x 3.0 a rare battery, sometimes used in car security (car alarm/keyfob batteries), organizer (backup battery for pda such as psion etc.), and glucometer equipment.

companies often provide specific battery names other than the industry standard in order to encourage people to buy the same brand. consumers are led to believe that there’s something unique to a certain battery. while certain brands may vary in quality, most are actually interchangeable with any other company’s model. if you search a battery on our site, you can find other compatible models listed in the “replacement for” section, making it easy to compare prices and features. if you’re still unsure after consulting our buyer’s guides, contact our customer service and we’ll get you on the right track. safety and precautions important: button and coin cells are harmful if swallowed, and are at a higher risk of being accidentally ingested by children due to their candy-like size and shape. be sure to store, recycle and dispose of your batteries in a safe, room temperature area out of the reach of youngsters and pets.[4] handle old, corroded batteries with care. battery acid is sulfuric acid, and prolonged contact with the skin can cause irritation, pain and even burns. though they are no longer produced for environmental reasons, mercury batteries were once a popular energy source, and while it’s unlikely you would come across one today, it’s worth noting that extra care should be taken when disposing of them. chemistry type code positive electrode negative electrode

energy in so many different capacities allows us to do things no other creature can. though small in stature, coin and button cell batteries have played a monumental role in ushering society into its current, hyper-connected state. these batteries are kings of convenience, saving us countless hours of time and work, and allowing us to focus on the best parts of life. buttons cells hold together the fabric of the modern world, and for all their value, coin cells might as well be the currency. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_battery_sizes#button_cells_-_coin.2c_watch. retrieved 20
