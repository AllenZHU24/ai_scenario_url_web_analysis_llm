nickel-cadmium this is the first technology ever used in rechargeable laptop batteries. these feature nickel-hydroxide electrodes with potassium-hydroxide as the electrolyte. nicd laptop batteries do last a decent amount of time before you have to replace them. however, they are known to be much heavier than the ones most of us are accustomed to and will add extra weight to an already heavy laptop. batteries made with nicd technology eventually suffer from "memory effect." this happens when you charge a nicd laptop battery without allowing it to completely lose its charge first. the battery stores that discharge point in its "memory," and will only discharge up to that point in the future, leaving you with a short battery life to deal with. at batteries.com, we can help you find replacement laptop batteries that use more modern technology and are still compatible with your pc. nickel-cadmium batteries are compatible as replacement laptop batteries for some older laptop models such as the compaq ltelite 33c and dell 312. nimh - nickel-metal hydride this technology is found in many laptops today. they last 40 percent longer than nicd laptop batteries and use the more environmentally-friendly metal alloy rather than toxic cadmium. while nickel-metal hydride batteries also suffer from "memory effect," they last much longer before this happens. you can charge nimh laptop batteries up to 1,000 times before having to replace them. these are more likely to lose a charge when you don't use them for a while than a battery using modern technology. keep in mind: use it or lose it. nickel-metal hydride batteries are more expensive than their nickel-cadmium counterparts. however, there is a much lower risk of fire associated with nimh batteries, making them the safest choice. many of the older ibm and toshiba laptop batteries have a nimh option. li-ion - lithium-ion lithium-ion is the most well-known and commonly-used laptop battery technology today. they don't suffer from "memory effect," and last longer than other batteries available. they don't have to be discharged completely to maintain their battery life and really work well if you charge it after use rather than use up all the power first. li-ion batteries won't weigh down your computer because they are made of lightweight cells. lithium-ion laptop batteries pack a lot of punch. this makes them more of a fire hazard than nicd or nimh. because of this, and because it will lengthen your laptop battery's life, it is important to not let your battery get too hot. as long as you follow all maintenance and cleaning instructions, and keep an eye out for any product recalls, you shouldn't have to worry about your li-ion batteries starting a fire. their light weight and high power are what make these batteries so popular. because of this, it's not difficult to find replacement or spare gateway or acer laptop batteries for newer models.all batteries regardless of the kind of technology they use, require proper care and handling. if you don't handle your battery carefully you could easily cause damage to it. think of it as equally delicate as your laptop. avoid abrupt collisions with hard surfaces, as well as dropping objects on the battery. and, just like any other electronics, laptop batteries can be badly damaged by water. if for some reason your laptop or battery is submerged in water, remove it immediately from the water, disconnect the battery and dry as much of the visible water as you can.batteries.com is the place to go if you need to buy new or replacement laptop batteries. we have a large inventory of oem and compatible batteries for each of the laptop batteries technologies listed above. no matter the type of technology your laptop battery currently uses, you can extend the battery's life by making sure the settings are all adjusted to use the least amount of power you need to operate your computer. take a look at our laptop battery guide for help finding a battery that fits your laptop and your budget. batteries.com customer center why shop at batteries.com? frequently asked questions learn about recycling battery glossary battery videos problems with the site? view all battery finder | sitemap | contact us | help | battery glossary | shipping guidelines | privacy policy batteries.com | 3502 woodview trace, suite 220 | indianapolis, in 46268 | for returns click here | batteries.com. inc.© 2012 | all rights reserved.
