"we've also redesigned the jar blade to be "greener" by optimizing blender efficiency while reducing the amount of electrical current used by the blender. this has made it possible to use this new jar and blade on our entry-level 1,560 watt home machines" said paul faerber, blendtec's engineering manager. "these blending jars have been used for years in commercial blending applications that require our most aggressive technology", said tom dickson, ceo of blendtec. "our expansion to the home market gives our customers access to a new level of blender performance that you simply cannot find anywhere else." this new wild side jar and blade, combined with the advanced technology of the blendtec motor and electronic controls, means any home kitchen can experience the power and control normally found only in professional kitchen environments. to contact blendtec visit their website: blendtec.com or call blendtec directly at 800 253-6383. ________________________________________________________________ about blendtec blendtec manufactures commercial blenders and dispensers for industrial applications, and blenders and appliances for home use. the award-winning will it blend? internet video series has demonstrated the amazing performance of blendtec's blender technology and raised awareness across the globe of the blendtec brand. distributed in 87 countries around the world, blendtec products offer the total solution for your blending needs. for more information, go to www.blendtec.com , or call blendtec directly at 800.253.6383. blendtec announces blender recipe contest   tuesday, july 28, 2009 blendtec announces blender recipe contest so you think you can blend recipe contest will award a blendtec total blender to the winner orem, utah, usa – july 28, 2009 – in the month of august, blendtec is holding a first of its kind recipe and recipe video contest called so you think you can blend. contestants who post a recipe and/or recipe video on their social media page and register the recipe at blendtec.com will be eligible to win a new blendtec total blender. the winner will be chosen by popularity and the blendtec judges' panel. recipes will be posted on blendtec's website and anyone can vote for their favorite recipe. for more information go to blendtec.com and click on the so you think you can blend contest banner on the right side of the page. blendtec's blenders use a unique patented jar and blade design which produce superior blending results. to find out more about blendtec visit their website: blendtec.com. you can also contact blendtec directly at 801 222-0888. to find out more about blendtec visit their website: blendtec.com. you can also contact blendtec directly at 801 222-0888. ________________________________________________________________ about blendtec blendtec manufactures commercial blenders and dispensers for industrial applications and blenders and appliances for home use. distributed in 70 countries around the world, blendtec products offer the total solution for your blending needs. for more information, go to www.blendtec.com blendtec introduces new bpa-free blending jar   monday, april 20, 2009 blendtec introduces new bpa-free blending jar new copolyester jar is bpa-free, more durable and has a lower pitch sound orem, utah, usa – april 20, 2009 – blendtec, a global provider of high-performance blenders and dispensing units, announced the release of a new blending jar which uses a copolyester material that has greater chemical resistance, improved sound dampening qualities, and contains no bpa (bisphenol a).
