we have sizes that work perfectly for a huge range of applications, including remote controls, cordless power tools, game controllers, heart monitors, outdoor security systems, and more. there are travel limitations on lithium batteries, so if you use airtravel frequently, it's important to know: in 2004, the us dot and the federal aviation administration (faa) limited the amount of lithium cells carried by a passenger to two (2). energizer recharge looking for a secondary cell that you can use again and again? energizer recharge is an excellent option for you! these batteries are made with nickle metal hydride (nimh) chemistry, and provide a nominal 1.2 voltage. we recommend them for high-drainage/high-use devices because they have a long life cycle. the nimh chemistry allows them to withstand repeated charge and discharge cycles while still maintaining their capacity. just how many times can you recharge energizer recharge batteries? up to 1,000 times - that's significant reusability! read more energizer max industrial ultimate lithium recharge hearing aid coin cell bulk page you're currently reading page 1 page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5 page next view as grid list items 1-48 of 233 sort by position product name price rating popularity new set ascending direction show 24 36 48 64 per page energizer max e91-vp aa 1.5v alkaline button top batteries -
