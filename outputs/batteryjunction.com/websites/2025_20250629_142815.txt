shipping will be calculated for items 2 & 3 only — item #1 will not be calculated into the shipping costs. standard shipping rates apply while over 95% of our items qualify for some type of free shipping offer there are some items which we are unable to ship for free. typically these are very large or heavy items which are often relatively inexpensive relative to the cost to ship. this is clearly marked on each item's page. while these items themselves do not qualify for free shipping their cost does contribute towards attaining the $50 minimum required for this offer.
