first of all, overstuffing your bag too often will damage it over time. it’s tempting to keep adding things you think you might need throughout the day, but bringing an overstuffed bag on your daily commute eventually stretches the material, making it sag and lose its shape. this is especially important if you’re using a leather sling bag. overstuffing will ruin the leather’s contour and may even lead to tears that are difficult to repair. another thing that could happen due to an overstuffed bag is shoulder and back pain. this is because you will be subjecting your one shoulder to most of the weight you’re carrying for hours at a time. there are several ways to lighten an overstuffed bag or change your habits to prevent pain. one thing you can do is put your bag on a diet. here are a few tips to doing so: first, make sure to bring only what you need. for most people, this should consist of a wallet, mobile phone, makeup kit (for the ladies), keys, and a pen. any other items will depend on your daily needs â but be sure that what you bring will really be used within the day. second, make sure that everything inside your bag is kept light as well. your wallet, for example, may be packed with pennies, unneeded credit and business cards, receipts, and coupons. although these don’t really add much weight alone, they can considerably make your wallet heavier together. check your keychain as well â do you really need all that metal with you? besides lightening your load, alternating between sling bags and a backpack is also recommended. this way, you won’t be burdening one shoulder with all your things every day. in fact, some of the sling bags we offer here at leather tree are convertible and can become a backpack with a single zip! with the right design, you’ll find yourself with a more comfortable daily commute. share different leather backpack purses for everyday convenience and style october 14th, 2013 - posted in backpack purses made to provide convenience with a versatile, stylish look, leather backpack purses are great bags for everyday use. whether you need one that’s just right for errands or one that’s fancier for a casual dinner out with friends, this kind of bag is perfect for the woman on-the-go. at leather tree, you can find a wide range of designs so you can easily find one that suits you best. a backpack purse is smaller than a standard backpack. this makes it easy to take to any place at any time. compared to the usual handbags most women would rather bring, a backpack purse allows you to free your hands. this makes it especially useful for errands or taking care of children. a purse made out of fine leather provides another functional feature: exceptional longevity and durability. here at leather tree, our selection of backpack purses includes convertible sling backpacks with split-zipper straps, skinny mini purses, zip top leather bags, and zip-around purses, among others. some designs are also available in a wide selection of colors that can turn a low-key bag into a great accent for your ensemble. besides the usual black and brown leather, you can find products in red, electric blue, tan, and cognac. if you want a bag that will allow you to easily reach your things, get a backpack purse without front flaps. a bag with exterior pockets is also a good choice. toni perotti’s monza zip-around italian leather backpack is a good example of a bag with no flaps. its exterior has a zip-around main compartment and a smaller zip-around front pocket. the interior has a cell phone pocket, business card pocket, and two pen slots. an organizer backpack from mowen leather is another product to consider if you want to easily reach your things. it features a fully-lined main compartment with a zippered divider in the front and a full-size zippered compartment behind it. the front part has pockets for holding business cards, pens, a pda, and a cell phone. looking for something that’ll add a touch of vintage charm to your look? consider something like clava leather’s zip top backpack or tony perotti’s florentina italian backpack. to accentuate a rustic look, choose these leather backpack purses in shades of brown such as cognac, tan, and cafe brown. on the other hand, if you want something a little more modern, look out for slim, colorful backpacks. scully leather and mowen leather are two brands that offer trendy bags in colors such as electric blue and red. a slim backpack in black is also a great choice if you want to appear more refined and chic. share privacy policy order by phone 847-487-7166 or 1-800-792-7002                           employment affiliates copyright ©1997-2010 leathertree     *free continental shipping for us ground sitemap    press
