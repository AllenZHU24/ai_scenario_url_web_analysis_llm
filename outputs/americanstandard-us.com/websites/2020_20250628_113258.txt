size in additional to making sure that the size of the individual bowls meet your needs, also consider the overall size of the sink. a larger sink provide more space for washing dishes but also takes away counter space which is especially critical in smaller kitchens. also make sure your new sink will fit the existing cabinets. some larger sinks might require custom sized cabinets. number of bowls how do you use your kitchen sink? do you wash a lot of baking pans? if so, consider a large single bowl sink or a dual level sink with enough room to lay the pans down to soak. most dual level sinks feature an oversized bowl to wash or soak things, with another smaller sink for rinsing or a garbage disposal. make sure both bowls are large enough to meet your kitchen needs. if you share kitchen responsibilities, consider two sinks. one can be used for food prep and the other for clean-up. an island or bar sink, usually a smaller single bowl sink, is the best option. what features will best match your needs? steep, straight side walls deeper bowls can accommodate soaking and rinsing large pots and pans. a relatively flat sink bottom increases usable bowl space and allows dishes and glasses to be safely stacked. off-set drains placing the drain to one side provides more flat space for stacking dishes and glasses and creates more usable space under the sink. offset drains also allow water to drain, even if a large pan or tray is soaking in the sink. web/divider for double bowl sinks, make sure the web divider between the two bowls is lower than the outside sink walls. this will provide overflow protection by allowing water to flow from one bowl to the other. what are benefits of stainless steel? stainless steel industrial strength appeal. 18-gauge, 18/10 american standard stainless steel kitchen sinks contain 18% chromium for lifetime protection from corrosion and 10% nickel for rich luster that only improves with age. this heavier gauge of stainless steel provides great durability and longevity. it's resistant to dents, uv rays and germs. countertop or undercounter? undercounter undercounter mount sinks mount directly to the underside of countertop material. this installation provides a flush mounting making it easy to clean. when choosing an undermount sink consider what type of countertop you have make sure the edges around the sink opening can be finished. self rimming self-rimming sinks have rounded corners and mount on the surface of the countertop material. this is the easiest type of installation, requiring only adhesive caulk to seal the sink in place. what kind of faucet do you like? the faucet you choose will dictate the number of holes you need in your sink. choose your ideal faucet and then order the sink accordingly. also consider additional holes for accessories such as soap dispensers and pull out hand sprays. view all kitchen sinks contact usaboutcase studiesleave a product reviewpresspress kitsregister warrantyreturnsshop clearance productsshop partssustainabilitywhere to buy american standardpersonalize your website experienceamerican standard for military sign up for our newsletter for the latest in american standard innovations, promotions, and more, sign up for the american standard newsletter! products ada products bathroom accessories bathroom faucets bidet toilet seats kitchen accessories bathroom sinks bathtub kitchen faucets shower toilets commercial commercial bathroom faucets commercial flushometers commercial kitchen faucets commercial showers commercial sinks commercial toilets urinals inspiration diy articles for pros go green with sustainable products innovation international canada mexico our sites careers business portal ©2019 american standard brand lixil privacy policy sitemap social policy headache-free installation. 1 purchase your faucet from american standard opt-in during the checkout process for more info on installation by taskrabbit. 2 you'll get an email from us about our partnership with taskrabbit click the link in the email to schedule a tasker. convenient & easy. 3 relax and enjoy your new american standard faucet  enjoy no-hassle installation by taskrabbit with your new american standard faucet. setup installation
