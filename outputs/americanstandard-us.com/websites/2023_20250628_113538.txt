important to saving our planet and conserving resources.american standard strongly recommends the purchase and installation of watersense toilets, urinals, shower heads, and faucets. the epa watersense® program makes it easy to find and select water efficient products and ensures confidence in those products with a label-program backed by independent certification and performance testing.california is the best-known example of a state further acting to address drought and water shortages. to help save water, the state has two important plumbing product requirements:calgreen, the state’s green building standard, enforces installation of water efficiency products through the building code.the california energy commission (cec) restricts and lists the sale of water consuming fittings and fixtures to comply with water-efficiency standards, at or lower than the applicable watersense® program standards.many additional states are following this lead and have begun requiring the use of high-efficiency toilets and water-saving faucets. american standard offers a variety of toilets, faucets, shower heads and commercial products that are compliant with the water-saving regulations needed for cec and calgreen. cec standards toilets shall not consume more than 1.28 gallons per flush and shall have a waste extraction score of no fewer than 350 grams showers shall not
