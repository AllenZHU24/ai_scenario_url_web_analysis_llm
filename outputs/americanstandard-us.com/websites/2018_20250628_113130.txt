soothing deep soaking bathtubs i have had this tub for close to a year and can't tell you how much i love it!!! it is so nice to be able to keep all of your body in the water at once. all tub users know that inconvenience of having to have your top or legs out of the water. this tub allows you to comfortably sit with everything underwater at once because of that unique deep soak overflow at the very tip top of the tub. i have to admit that the 36" is a little wider than i think would be necessary for my comfort, but we had the space for it, so that is what i got. i think i could have been just as satisfied with the 32" and it would have used a bit less water. i would highly recommend this tub to anyone who likes to soak in a nice hot bath at the end of a hectic day. - susieq1972
