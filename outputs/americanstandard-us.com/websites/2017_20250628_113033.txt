come in all shapes and sizes. here are a few things to consider when finding the faucet that's right for you. sink faucets speed connect® drain american standard bathroom faucets are equipped with the speed connect drain. this pre-assembled drain contains just four parts compared to the average fourteen of most drains and requires no plumber's putty. the lift rod also comes set to the correct height and never comes loose. with1/3 the parts that install in 1/3 the time, it makes it easy for the do-it-yourselfer and the tradesmen. style avoid a tiny faucet on a big, bold sink, and vice-versa. also make sure that the style, such as contemporary or traditional, matches that of the sink. look for a faucet that directs water into the center of the bowl. for a large sink consider a tall gooseneck or one with a pull-out spray. if the faucet's too short it may not reach far enough. make sure your new faucet matches the correct hole drillings in your sink, 4" centers, 8" centers, or single hole. handles how many and what type of handles do you desire? our designs range from traditional cross handles to contemporary single-lever and two handle models. lever handles in both single and dual control designs are not only stylish, they're also the easiest to use for people with smaller or less flexible fingers. mounting to keep things interesting, we offer a variety of faucets that mount directly to the sink, a faucet deck, countertop, or wall. as with hole patterns, make sure that your faucet is compatible with your sink especially when it comes to vessel sinks which require tall countertop mounted vessel faucets or wall-mounted faucets. holes choosing a 3-hole sink with a 4" spread gives you the most faucet options, including the use of a 4" centerset, 4" mini-spread or a center-hole faucet with a base plate. however, some people prefer the simplicity of center-hole designs, or the traditional appeal of 8" spreads. the choice is yours to make, and enjoy. dripless faucets consider how a new faucet will last. or, more importantly, how long it will last without dripping. faucets should offer long-term performance and be drip-free for life. ceramic disc valving utilizes discs made of hardened ceramic, a durable material that won't wear out and won't leak even under the toughest water conditions. pull out select bathroom and kitchen faucets feature a pull out or pull down spout in which the end of the spout of the faucet can e ‘pulled out' from the rest of the spout similar to a side spray. these faucets allow you to bring the water flow to where you need it in the sink. watersense® if you're concerned with conserving water, look for watersense certified toilets. developed by the environmental protection agency, the watersense label is used on toilets and faucets that are certified by independent laboratory testing to meet rigorous criteria for both performance and efficiency. view all bathroom faucets view all kitchen faucets
