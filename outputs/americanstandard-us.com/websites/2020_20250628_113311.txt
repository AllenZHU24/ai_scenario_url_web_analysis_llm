how about a pair of matching above-counter basins perched on their own vanity cabinets? you have many options to choose from. here's what to consider when choosing a new bathroom sink... what type of bathroom sink do you like? pedestal a good choice for powder rooms and guest baths where storage is less important and space is limited. their sleek, sophisticated lines can visually enlarge a room, while also enhancing its appearance. pedestal bathroom sinks come in a variety of styles and shapes. wall-mount wall mount bathroom sinks feature a basin that it hung from the wall at a location and height that you choose. lately, these bathroom sinks have seen a rapid gain in popularity. in part because there are so many attractive and innovative designs available, but also because they're ideal for universal access applications. undercounter clean, modern, distinctive. that's the beauty of undercounter bathroom sinks. they free up usable counter space, and since there is no rim to catch debris, they're also the easiest type of bathroom sink to keep clean. above counter/vessel versatile and stylish, above-counter bathroom sinks rise above the countertop, console or cabinet to create a dramatic focal point. they are best suited for master baths and powder rooms, especially in contemporary, cosmopolitan homes. keep in mind that since these bathroom sinks sit above the countertop, the countertop should be lower than normal to allow easy access to the bathroom sink. also consider what type of faucet to use with a vessel bathroom sink. tall vessel faucets work well along with wall mounted faucets. countertop these bathroom sinks, also called drop-ins and self-rimming, fit into a variety of countertops. and thanks to their self-rimming nature, they're the simplest type to install. countertop bathroom sinks are the style most commonly found in high-traffic family bathrooms. integral countertop these bathroom sinks combine a countertop and bathroom sink together. their one piece, seamless design allows for a clean, sleek look. since there are no crevices they are also one of the easiest styles to keep clean. semi-countertop here's a smart way to maximize usable space in a small area. since the basin extends beyond a narrow ledge or vanity, a semi-countertop bathroom sink offers you a surprisingly large basin while preserving valuable floor space. corner for small bathrooms with an empty corner, corner bathroom sinks are a great choice. available in both pedestal and wall-mount options, these bathroom sinks save space by fitting directly into a corner. how big is your bathroom? check the exact dimensions of the location for the new bathroom sink. will your new bathroom sink fit into an existing cut-out or space? what type of faucet do you like? what type of faucet will you choose? faucets come in all shapes and styles, too. don't put a tiny faucet on a big, bold bathroom sink, or vice-versa. make sure the style, such as traditional or modern, matches that of the bathroom sink. finally, check that the bathroom sink since and faucet have matching hole punching, usually center, 4" or 8" and are compatible especially when it comes to vessel bathroom sinks. what color matches your bathroom? when choose color consider the color of other fixtures in your bathroom. will the colors match or clash? also for countertop bathroom sinks, think about the look you want to create between the color of the countertop and the color of the bathroom sink. do you want them to blend together or be contrasting? how much storage space do you need? how much storage space do you need? make sure the bathroom sink option you choose will have enough deck space to place toiletries on. this is especially vital when choosing wall-mount or pedestal bathroom sink which do no have a surrounding countertop and provide no additional storage like a vanity. what style do you like?
