editorial reviews product description the studio that brought you marvel’s the avengers unleashes the best iron man adventure yet with this must-own, global phenomenon starring robert downey jr. and gwyneth paltrow. when tony stark/iron man finds his entire world reduced to rubble, he must use all his ingenuity to survive, destroy his enemy and somehow protect those he loves. but a soul-searching question haunts him: does the man make the suit… or does the suit make the man? featuring spectacular special effects, marvel’s iron man 3 explodes with exclusive blu-ray content. amazon.com tony stark/iron maneccentric genius, billionaire, philanthropist tony stark is the armored super-hero known as iron man. decompressing from his heroic, near-self-sacrificial action as iron man that saved new york city from annihilation, tony finds himself unable to sleep and plagued by worry and trepidation. when his world is destroyed and those closest to him threatened, tony must find a way to save them and in the process find him again.pepper pottspepper has progressed from tony stark's assistant to the head of stark industries, pausing along the way to fall in love with tony as well. bright, loyal and honest, pepper understands tony stark more than anyone and sometimes that can be both a worrisome and dangerous thing.colonel james "rhodey" rhodes / iron patriotrhodey is the liaison between stark industries and the u.s. air force. he is one of tony stark's few trusted friends and most of the time has the patience to deal with the impulsive genius. rhodey has a new suit of war machine armor in a red, silver, and blue patriotic design. when suited up, rhodey becomes iron patriot.the mandarinmandarin is the sinister head of the terrorist organization known as the ten rings, from which all the actors of extreme terrorism plaguing the world appear to emanate. although he is reclusive, mandarin wields great power and makes his presence known by striking fear in the government and the populace through his brazen plans of attack. see all editorial reviews customer reviews (2,474) 4.1 out of 5 stars 5 star 1,349 4 star 522 3 star 276 2 star 149 1 star 178 see all

following review helpfuldetailed digital copy information by j. courtright on february 26, 2014format: blu-ray verified purchase while not offering an ultraviolet digital copy, i am encouraged that marvel at least provided some reasonable digital copy options with this set: iron man 3 (two-disc blu-ray / dvd + digital copy). digital copy owners can select either:option 1: disney movies anywhere (account registration required) plus itunes, oroption 2: any one of the following standalone providers (with no disney movies anywhere account registration required): itunes, vudu, amazon instant video, or google play.i have a vudu account, which i selected, so i now have a digital copy of iron man 3 (hdx quality) with the ability to download or stream the movie in hd.can i ask a favor of everyone for whom the above information was useful? can we please collectively keep asking amazon to provide the detailed digital copy information in the product description of the dvds and blu-rays that it sells? in the product details section of every amazon dvd/blu-ray listing is a line that says, "did we miss any relevant features for this product? tell us what we missed." with a link. every time i buy a dvd/blu-ray from amazon now, i click this link and enter "missing detailed digital copy information". if a few million of us customers do this, perhaps amazon will listen and start including this important information in the product description for a change. thanks! 5 comments was this review helpful to you? yes no sending feedback... thank you for your feedback. if this review

brian driver top 1000 reviewer on may 6, 2013format: blu-ray let me start by saying that i can understand why there are a lot of split opinions about iron man 3. it's a film full of misdirection and deceptions, and i was a little distressed by a couple of them - which would give away too much to detail here. suffice it to say that there were a couple of moments i felt somewhat cheated; and though i'll be vague about it i can say it involved mandarin. still, read on; while i gave the movie four stars, i believe down the road i might very well revise this to a five. i'll explain...first of all, rest assured there is a lot of action. and there are a lot of the iron suits, too...it's just that tony stark isn't often the one in the suit. i found myself often frustrated by that fact: iron man interruptus, if you will. either the suits were off on their own, or they were on other people, or they weren't working properly...something that seemed to occur almost constantly.i saw it in imax 3d, and it was well worth the extra $$ to do so (given the fact that $17 is a ridiculous price for a movie ticket in the first place). the movie was lush, packed with detail, and continuously drew me "inside" it. the scenes of (don't panic about spoilers - these are in all the promos) stark's house exploding and falling into the sea are meticulously crafted and extremely inclusive...i really felt the dimensional layers as the house was blown apart: i could feel the force of the detonation, and house collapsing, and the impact of the sea as the house and iron man tumbled into it. similarly, the moments where his suit fly through the air and "find" him, or the death-defying scenes aboard (and outside) air force one, and so many others throughout the film really do feel like you're there.read

anything plotwise for those who haven't seen this movie yet but my advice to everyone is to watch "the avengers" before watching this one. the reason for this is because the movie frequently references things that happened there and they will make more sense to the viewer. it at least sticks with canon where the films are concerned. while "the avengers" isn't necessarily "iron man 2.5", there are things that happen to the tony stark character in that film that come into play in "iron man 3".(personal side note, i purchased the single disc dvd, just because that was in my budget. i would have preferred blu ray but i am one movie fan who doesn't really nitpick about formats. i will watch a film on vhs if i want to see it bad enough.)that notwithstanding, it is still a great film on its own. if you want to see robert downey jr. a lot, this film will not disappoint you in that department, nor will you feel cheated out of special effects galore, stunning and jaw dropping stunts, and great stuff all around.ben kingsley is hilarious. there are many instances where you laugh out loud in this film.it is an all around entertaining way to spend two hours and eleven minutes.the story takes place around christmas time, which surprised me that it was a summer film. i guess paramount figured it would be a better time to launch the third film in the franchise. it isn't technically a "holiday" film anyway, but in any case, paramount studios dominated movie theaters when this first came out and then "star trek: into darkness" started playing a week or so later and they ran concurrently there for a while..then "star trek" got released for home viewing first.one last thing.read more › 3 comments was this review helpful to you? yes no sending feedback... thank you

like it more everytime i rewatch it by jonathan m. george on november 9, 2013format: blu-ray the first time i saw this movie i really didn't like it, i had just come off the high of "the avengers" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. that said it is significantly better than iron man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. there's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.one thing i like about this movie is that you get to learn more about tony stark, as much as i loved his arrogance in im1, 2 at the end of avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. on the one hand i love the suits and the fancy technology but it's robert downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while i was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards avengers 2.it may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. i was angry the first time i did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time i've watched it i take something more from it and enjoy it a little more. 1 comment was this review helpful to you? yes no sending feedback... thank you for your feedback. if this review is inappropriate, please let us know. sorry, we failed to
