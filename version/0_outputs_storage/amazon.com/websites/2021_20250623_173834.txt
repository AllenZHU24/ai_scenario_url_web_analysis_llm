canner for preserving fruits, jams, jellies, pickles and salsa in pint and half pint jars. also handy as a large capacity pressure cooker. constructed of warp-resistant, heavy-gauge aluminum for fast, even heating. works on regular and smooth-top ranges. deluxe pressure dial gauge registers the complete range of processing pressures. this precise measurement is especially important at higher altitudes. air vent/cover lock allows pressure to build up only when the cover is closed properly and prevents the cover from opening until pressure is safely reduced. 23-quart liquid capacity (21.8 liters). amazon.com the usda recommends pressure canning as the only safe method for low-acid foods such as vegetables, meats, and poultry. the presto 23-quart pressure canner is more than adequate for any home canning needs. it's a professional-quality tool, made of heavy-duty aluminum, with stay-cool handles and a strong-lock steel lid. an accompanying rack fits down into the pot to keep jars up off the bottom, so that liquid can circulate underneath. and it can do double duty as a large pressure cooker. it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor. the sturdy lid locks down during canning or cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. in addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. the pressure dial gauge gives an accurate reading so that pressure can be kept constant during canning. this pressure canner is also a cooker that's useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. an accompanying booklet contains more than 50 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roasts--even sweets like english plum pudding or brown bread! tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork, or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture. nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. the lid of the presto 23-quart pressure canner is not immersible. in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. the dial gauge is delicate; detailed care instructions are found in the accompanying booklet. the vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. the pressure cooker measures 14 inches in diameter (17 inches including handles) and 15-1/2 inches tall (including lid). presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. a detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. --garland withers top brand: presto highly rated 100k+

01781 pressure canner and cooker: a multifunctional marvel for mushroomthe presto 01781 pressure canner and cooker, with its 23 qt capacity and sleek silver design, has been a game-changer in my mushroom growing endeavors, and i am more than happy to share my positive experience with this versatile tool. from the get-go, what impressed me was its sheer size and simplicity of use. the canner is spacious enough to accommodate all my sterilization needs without feeling cumbersome. its construction is robust, promising longevity and resilience, especially important when dealing with the rigors of regular sterilization processes required in mushroom cultivation. the ease of assembly and operation is noteworthy. setting it up was straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions provided, making it ready for use almost immediately. the inclusion of a 15lb pressure regulator, contrary to my initial belief, negated the need for any additional purchases, streamlining the process further. its performance in sterilizing mushroom substrate jars has been exceptional. the canner efficiently reaches and maintains the necessary 15psi, crucial for eliminating any contaminants, thereby ensuring a sterile environment for mushroom spawn. the safety features, including a lock that engages with pressure buildup and a vent pipe acting as a primary pressure relief valve, instill confidence in its use, mitigating any concerns of potential mishaps. the capacity to hold and effectively sterilize multiple jars in a single session has significantly optimized my workflow. not only does it save time, but it also allows for larger batches to be prepared, enhancing productivity. the durability of the canner, evidenced by the heavy-duty seal and quality materials, ensures that it can withstand the demands of frequent use. while primarily purchased for mushroom growing, its versatility extends beyond, capable of canning a wide array of foods, which speaks to its multifunctionality. the only caveat noted was the gauge and weight discrepancy during operation, which required some attention to ensure accurate pressure management. however, this was a minor issue in the grand scheme, easily overshadowed by its overall stellar performance. in conclusion, the presto 01781 pressure canner and cooker has been an invaluable addition to my mushroom cultivation toolkit. its robust construction, ease of use, and exceptional functionality make it a highly recommended purchase for anyone in the field. whether you're a seasoned mycologist or a hobbyist looking to dive into mushroom cultivation, this pressure canner and cooker is a wise investment that promises reliability, efficiency, and safety.morehidethank you for your feedbackclosesorry, there was an

united states on may 15, 2025style: 23 qt cannerverified purchase i use a canner for mushroom cultivation. the last canner i had was smaller with no gauge to tell you when you had reached 15 p.s.i. consequently, there were few times when my rye berries did not reach full sterilization, which ultimately resulted in mold. no such problems here. i confidently have quality mushroom cultivation every time. i'm very satisfied with my purchase read more 3 people found this helpful helpful report anv ohio5.0 out of 5 stars no need to check gauge or buy another regulator reviewed in the united states on august 29, 2012style: 23 qt cannerverified purchase i just received my unit and although i have not used the unit, i have read the book completely and called presto and they say there's no need to have the gauge checked. if it's new, it's ready go to, just follow the cleaning instructions on page 6 and 7 of the book. they also state there's no reason to buy another 15lb rocker because it comes with one. i ordered the extra rocker for $12 but the unit came last night and has a 15lb rocker in it. pressure regulator would be the better more proper term, not rocker. i also work in the air pressure industry for a living and we rarely test our gauges unless something obvious is happening and we have variable testing at our facility that goes from 10psi to 300 psi, which that kind of pressure can be dangerous. so i'm not sure why people think they need to get their gauge tested. even if the gauge is faulty, the rocker is going to rock at 15lbs and never let the pot get higher than this. additionally, the books states there is a vent pipe (page4) is the "primary pressure relief valve and will release pressure in excess of 15 pounds. the pressure regulator sits loosely on the vent pipe." that's a quote. so this unit is designed to be at 15 lbs or below which the pot can handle. i'm not sure why anyone would blow the lid off unless they rolled their rubber ring, their ring was old or not seated properly or the top was not locked. again, i haven't used the unit yet, and will follow up soon with a review on that, but from my perspective, i'm going to can tomatoes over the next couple of days and that is 11 lbs of pressure which means i will need my gauge and my rocker should never rock. i have to play with the heat to find where my stove dial holds the pot at 11 lbs and make sure i never see the pressure regulator move or that means the pot has reached 15 lbs. ?? some of these reviews were confusing and also caused me to buy a 15 lb regulator that came with the unit. it seems unnecessary. ?? sure seems it's ready to go out of the box, no need to check or buy another item.okay, i went home and used it last night. i have updates. first, this is a great unit. i can't imagine anyone blowing the lid off if you align it and lock it down. i filled it with water, put it on and ran it up to 15 lbs of pressure. on my stove it took 19 minutes to get there but that's going to vary. i think i understand why people suggest getting the variable weight. in my case, i can a lot of tomatoes. i need this at 10-11 pounds for 15 minutes. i either have to play with the heat setting on my stove to get it to stay at 10-11 pounds, while keeping an eye on it, or if you buy the rocker weight that is 5-10-15 lbs, you can take it apart, make it a 10 lb rocker and just set it and forget it. i see the logic but don't think that makes buyin the other part necessary, it just saves a little time. plus, for tomatoes, they suggest 11 lbs. if you are anal and want 11, the variable weight can't do that. if you don't mind 10-11 pounds, no big deal. either way, i didn't take my cooker to have the gauge tested, this is ready to go out of the box. just make sure and put a little oil on the ring to keep it in good shape and you might just want to have a back up ring on hand as the unit ages so that on that weekend you want to can, if the ring splits, you slide the new one in and keep going. great unit and it's huge! i love it.another update...this baby is getting a good workout. canned a bunch of sauce last night, working on more as i type. we bought the additional weight/rocker that you can make 5-10-15 pounds. put it at 10 pounds and let it pressure for 16 minutes. gets the tomato sauce in the jars up to 240 degrees killing all that might be present. great pressure canner. highly recommend. again, still don't understand how anyone could blow the lid off if you align this properly. no blown lids here. just gotta read the book and use it properly i think.another update - well, we've done 7 gallons of roma tomato sauce, 5 quarts a session and this pressure canner is great. it's so easy to lock the lid. i've also realized it has a special lock that when pressure starts to build, but even before it can be read on the gauge, the lock pops up and there's no way you can open this canner with pressure so no danger. i will say that when my 16 minutes at 11 lbs for tomato sauce are up, i take a kitchen knife and lean the pressure rocker over to let the steam out quickly. within 4-5 minutes, all the pressure has bleed out, the lock goes back down and i take the lid off. this is not in the book, but i was just dying to see how the jars looks. as i took them out, they were still boiling and we put a laser temp gauge on them and they were reading 210-215. given the heat was turned off over 4-5 minutes ago, it's reasonable to assume it was indeed up to 240 which is what is needed to kill all the stuff for tomato sauce. keep in mind, this is different for every food, for every size and for every elevation. so read the book for your food and it will tell you what to do. i recommend citric acid as well as the adjustable pressure regulator (rocker) and a canning kit, particularly to get the jars out. taking them out at 215 degrees is careful business. but it's cool to see them boiling inside the jars. and within 10 minutes, they are down to 160 which is when the 'tinning' or vacuming starts. as you know, the cooling is what causes the air tight seal, not the pressure canning. pressure canning is to raise the temp up high enough to kill all the germs, when you take them out, they do the tinning sounds and you can hear all the tops going ting, ting.....ting...then you know you are getting a great seal! read more 570

use but rude customer support reviewed in canada on may 18, 2022style: 23 qt cannerverified purchase so, my pressure canner did not come with a manual and i was nervous about safety issues as i had never used one before. i’ve used a pressure cooker and that is not the same thing.i called customer support and the woman was quite rude. basically made me feel like i was an idiot and told me to read the manual…which i would have except i never received one with my canner. i did get a link to one online which i went through.this canner can hold 16 1/2 pint jars (500ml). i had to take the handles off the canning basket in order to take advantage of the extra height for 2 levels of jars.i also have an induction stove so i had to use a magnetic flat plate between the aluminum canner in order for the burner to turn on. by doing that it does take away from high heat and it took 45 minutes before the pressure canner reached 11 psi where i started the 100 minute countdown requirement for raw beef.after 100 minutes, i turned the stove off and let the canner depressurize and cool completely. the jars at the bottom were oily and i guess that’s because i must have had some seepage from a jar that probably had one cube too many. i can’t tell which jar because they are all sealed very well. i just gave them all a soapy bath so they’re all sparkly clean. adding 1/2c of white vinegar to the 3 quarts of water also helped to keep the jars from being affected with hard water. the inside of the aluminum pot now has a black ring stain all around which nothing - not even an sos pad can remove.overall, i highly recommend this pressure canner. it’s my 2nd time canning meat and with how well this has turned out i am super excited to start canning chicken, pork and salmon. i will also pressure can many other vegetables. with the price of food and not knowing if we’ll ever have black outs or brown outs, i am confident i will be able to feed my family with foods that i would normally freeze or refrigerate. pressure canned meat can last up to 2 years. bonus is when you crack open a jar, it smells like roast beef (i just place raw beef trimmed of most fat in the jars - nothing else). the juice it creates does have some ‘scum’ so i give that to my dogs. it’s like beef nectar to them. then i rinse the meat off. it’s super tender and just delicious. read more phoebe buffay 5.0

report hmd5.0 out of 5 stars simple, safe and easy way to preserve food for months or even years. reviewed in australia on september 23, 2024style: 23 qt cannerverified purchase i bought this because i kept running out of space in my chest freezer, for long term storage of the harvests from my garden. since getting it though, not only have i preserved my own garden produce, but have made umpteen ready to serve meals and soups in a jar (all free of additives too of course!). for many things, like preserving most vegetables, to successfully deep freeze you need to blanche veggies first in boiling water, then ice bath, then lay out on single level trays to freeze, then once frozen, pack in bags. whereas to pressure can, for many veggies you can just peel and chop them up, put in jar raw, add water, and can! so much less mess and hassle, and it doesn't take up any space in my freezer. the preserved canned food lasts absolutely ages just sat on a pantry shelf. heat and eat or add to other recipes when you want to use them! what a brilliant device. wish i had known about pressure canning years ago and i wouldn't have had to buy a second chest freezer! read more report see more
