i'm so frustrated whenever i call all they say is " we are trying to make things better that's why it's taking so long" oh really? i spend thousands of dollars at the limited every year and this last month i have had the worst experiences. i waited 4 weeks for an order i placed in the store and when i finally got it it was the wrong color and they didn't have any more in stock of the right color. the shirt i am waiting for now is no longer available online so i'm guessing i won't get it at all and i bought it to go with a skirt that i finally got last week, and i was supposed to have 3 virtual dollars in this order that i never received and they expire today. so i guess i won't get to use those either. 4 · 4 hours agolatricia m booker-joseph if any one has virtual dollars to spare ..i need 3 please nbox me please2 · 4 hours agofani ramirez fani ramirez like the limited;-)11 · 6 hours agomore postslikessee alllikeundoreal simplemagazinelikeundoinstylemagazinelikeundoglamourmagazinelikeundoeloquiiretail and consumer merchandiselikeundopeople stylewatchproduct/servicethe limited3 hours agothere's nothing quite as feminine as lace and this season it's everywhere. a touch of lace adds graceful polish that will see you through from day to night. here are a few of our favorite looks…2like · comment · sharenicole bauman, sonia lopez and 94 others like this.lindsay doerr just got the outfit on the left!
