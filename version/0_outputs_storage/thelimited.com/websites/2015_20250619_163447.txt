pre-authorizations a pre-authorization is a type of pending bank charge used to check an account for validity or approve funding for a purchase you attempt to make. a merchant may pre-authorize an amount before you make a purchase (a thelimited.com order, for example), and then submit the final charge later (such as when your thelimited.com order ships to you). that final charge amount may be different from the merchant's pre-authorized amount. another type of pre-authorization charge applies when a purchase is approved but won't be posted to your account until later (when an item is back-ordered and shipping is delayed, for example). keep in mind, a charge may be pending for a few days; this essentially holds the pending funds for the intended purchase but does not charge them permanently. once the permanent charge is posted, the pre-authorization charge will "fall off" your account. this can take up to 3-5 days. contact your banking institution if this does not occur.
