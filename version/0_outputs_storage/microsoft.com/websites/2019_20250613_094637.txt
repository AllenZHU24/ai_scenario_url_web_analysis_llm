(she recommend this to her friend and she also bought one as well.) very beautiful design with cool color (she had burgundy), and the keyboard is one of the best. speed is super fast, battery is good (even not as good as microsoft claimed), and she get used to the windows quite quickly. this is so far the most beautiful traditional laptop on the market. i think this will sell whole a lot.59 out of 68 people found this helpful.greviewed bygarrett55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on6/19/2017review title of garrettexceeds expectations! i've had the surface 3 for several years, and the fabric still looks brand new, so i don't expect this laptop's keyboard to be any different. it's great to not have to rest your hands on freezing metal. it has amazing battery life, and a very high-quality keyboard material. what's even more surprising is how stunning it looks, and it certainly turns heads! i have the cobalt blue, and i can say that it is gorgeous and adds to the high quality experience. in low lit areas, it can seem like a dark grey or black which (personally) i love! it's great to have more unique colors offered for laptops. for those worried about windows 10 s and the restrictions that come with it, a simple click of a button upgrades you to windows pro without any fee and allows you unrestricted access to the things you want to download. i can easily say that choosing this over an apple product was the right decision, especially if you like windows, a touch screen, and want to be unique. amazing work! 32 out of 36 people found this helpful.jreviewed byjacob55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on7/17/2017review title of jacobhighly recommendin brief, this is the laptop that has brought me back from the apple brand. i previously had a macbook air. i purchased the i7/8gb ram model and am amazed by how smoothly it runs. not only that, i love being back in the windows os environment. this device is engineered perfectly: it's comfortable, it's design is beautiful, the screen looks great, and the keyboard has great action which is nice for someone like me who spends a lot of time writing. i also bought microsoft complete with this purchase and i feel like that fact that microsoft is willing to back up their product with such a good warranty (covering accidental damage) shows how keen they are to see it succeed and invested in customer service. overall i have zero complaints.30 out of 34 people found this helpful.breviewed bybioasune55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on8/1/2017review title of bioasunethe ultimate laptop experiencei am extremely picky with my laptops, and i have to say ms nailed this one. i judge based on an overall experience in general. inputs on the touchpad are seamless, the keyboard is a dream, screen (especially with the 3x2 ratio) is outstanding for daily use. the body is very thin, and battery is well beyond what you probably need. touch gestures can be set to your liking, huge bonus. magnetic charger is a+. this laptop offers the best user experience on a windows 10 machine, period. i bought the cobalt i5/256 model, and will never miss my 2015 macbook pro. my only gripe? 1 usb-c port, please.18 out of 20 people found this helpful.greviewed bygiang55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on7/13/2017review title of giangwhat a surprise!!!got the machine from bestbuy with grey color and $1300 config options. i was really skeptical because i am switching from mac (not a fan of dongle) and got a faulty hp spectre. after returning the hp i decided to give this a try and oh boy! this laptop rocks, the fabric stop the issue of keyboard getting hot when running heavy load programs. battery life is definitely top of the line compare to other window laptops or even macbook pro. upgrade to window 10 pro only takes 2 minutes. the performance is absolutely amazing and it can run multiple browser tabs and apps at the same time without any issue. fan noise is also very very quiet. 5 stars.29 out of 35 people found this helpful.mreviewed bymia55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on7/5/2017review title of miacobalt blue surface laptopi absolutely love my surface laptop. i am still running windows 10 s and currently do not have a need to switch to windows 10 pro. it continues to turn heads and gets major attention. i have been a microsoft fan for years and feel that this surface device is the best!! microsoft has out done themselves with this model. i highly recommend getting this device!! one of my favorite features is the speaker quality coming from the speakers hidden underneath the keyboard. the ability to be able to open my device with one hand is magically. my surface laptop blows away my surface pro 4, surface book and all other surface models i have owned. don't take my word for it, please go to your nearest microsoft store to experience the greatness first hand :)40 out of 50 people found this helpful.treviewed bytim45user rating: 4 out of 5submitted on6/16/2017review title of tima decent product and solid build.i received my surface laptop two days ago - earlier that the june 15th ship date, which is nice. i immediately switched from windows 10s to windows 10 pro, as i had some software i need to run which isn't available on the microsoft store. everybody is talking about the lack of usb-c, and i agree... this was a mistake for microsoft to not standardize on this. but it's the right size and price, and i've enjoyed using touch screen on my surface pro 3, so i went for it. the screen is brilliant and crisp, and the 2:3 aspect ratio looks great when browsing. the keyboard is much more solid than my surface 3, and the alcantara feels nice. my only disappointment was with the keyboard backlighting, which is very uneven and "cheap" looking. the "7/&" key is about 5x brighter that adjacent keys, and the whole thing looks spotty. but the keys feel nice and reassuring. trackpad works well too. 22 out of 26 people found this helpful.ureviewed byunknown55user rating: 5 out of 5submitted on7/24/2017review title of unknownall in baby!! love this computer!bought this laptop today got to say saw endless videos of this laptop. looks similar to the macbook lol but give credit to microsoft of the look and build of the laptop!! the look of this gives it more of a edge and the fabric looks crazy makes me skeptical of how to be more careful haha after i rate it 20/10 amazing with the touchscreen and soon going to get a pen to be a lot easier!!39 out of 49 people found this helpful.1-10 of 140 reviewspreviousnext students, parents, and military save 10% bring your ideas to life with exclusive savings on the new surface laptop (1st gen). available for eligible students, parents, teachers, and military. check now bundle and save save up to $109 and maximize your productivity with the surface laptop (1st gen) bundle. it includes your choice of surface laptop (1st gen), sleeve, 2-year extended warranty, plus 1 year of office 365. shop now buy office today and save save $20 when you add office 365 home or personal to your order. it includes fully installed versions of word, excel, powerpoint, outlook, and more. plus, 1tb cloud storage for each user. office 365 home can be installed on 5 pcs or macs, 5 tablets, and 5 phones. open in new tab sign me up stay informed about special deals, the latest products, events, and more from microsoft store. sign up by clicking sign up, i agree that i would like information, tips, and offers about microsoft store and other microsoft products and services. privacy policy thank you! you’re now signed up to receive microsoft store emails. thank you! close questions?
