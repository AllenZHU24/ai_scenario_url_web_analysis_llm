not even a usb-c one of the best surface device i've ever used, the other one is surface book 2. but both have no thunderbolt 3, this surface pro 6 doesn't even have a usb-c for usb3.1??? come on, microsoft, you can ditch the low voltage cpu on surface book to get enough pcie bandwidth. and easily put a extra usb-c on surface pro 6 since it have 12 lanes pcie. yes, i agree usb type-c may not be main stream in the next few years, but at least you should give us a thunderbolt 2 instead of a mini displayport only port...as a professional user, we have surface dock which already have 2 mdp. so please, do not ditch traditional data transfers to force customers to use your onedrive, i'm using it but please listen. more 19 out of 19 people found this helpful. was this helpful?
